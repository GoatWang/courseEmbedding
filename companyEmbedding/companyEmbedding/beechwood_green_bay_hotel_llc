Very clean and great hotel breakfast'"5/5 George"We really enjoy this hotel will use it again"5/5 Patricia"Great place, clean, spacious"5/5 Cindy"It was comfortable, clean, and the next best thing to being home. I
enjoyed having the option to cook wholesome meals rather than dining out
all the time. So nice to kick back in front of the fireplace and eat a
leisurely home cooked meal. The bed was actually comfortable- not worn
out, lumpy or void of support.

"4/5 Allen"Breakfast and room size"5/5 Anonymous"Amazing what you get for your money here! The staff is friendly and the room was great. The place is very clean, the breakfast they provide is wonderful. I would definitely stay here again!"5/5 William"Room very spacious and equipped.

This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our", and "ReservationDesk.com" refer to ReservationDesk.com, and its parent company and company affiliates, including Reservation Counter, LLC, TravelPASS Group, LLC, and Partner Fusion, Inc (collectively, the "ReservationDesk.com Companies"). The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms and Conditions" or "Agreement"). Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms and Conditions then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to the Terms and Conditions, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.USE OF THE WEBSITEAs a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that:1) you are at least 18 years of age;2) you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation;3) you will use this Website in accordance with these Terms and Conditions;4) you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act;5) you will inform such other persons about the Terms and Conditions that apply to the reservations you have made on their behalf, including all rules and restrictions applicable thereto;6) all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete; and7) if you have a ReservationDesk.com account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by you and anyone other than you.We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of these Terms and Conditions.DISPUTESReservationDesk.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy ("Claims") by contacting ReservationDesk.com Customer Support. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, travel suppliers, or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms and Conditions, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms and Conditions required arbitration.There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys' fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms and Conditions as a court would.Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator's fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to "ReservationDesk.com Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager," at TravelPASS Group, LLC., 2961 West Maple Loop Drive, Suite 300, Lehi, Utah 84043.  If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.PROHIBITED ACTIVITIESThe content and information on this Website (including, but not limited to, price and availability of travel services) as well as the infrastructure used to provide such content and information, is proprietary to us or our suppliers and providers.

You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.ReservationDesk.com is not liable for any costs incurred due to hotel relocation.PRIVACY POLICYReservationDesk.com Inc. believes in protecting your privacy. Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy.PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONSYou acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the ReservationDesk.com Companies and the facilitation fee retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services. You authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the ReservationDesk.com Companies' services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, the ReservationDesk.com Companies do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice the ReservationDesk.com Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the ReservationDesk.com Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the ReservationDesk.com Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you may be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation.You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.You may not book reservations for more than 9 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 9 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact ReservationDesk.com's call center. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by ReservationDesk.com for your hotel booking.BANK AND CREDIT CARD FEESSome banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since ReservationDesk.com may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.INTERNATIONAL TRAVELYou are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. ReservationDesk.com has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, RESERVATIONDESK.COM DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.LIABILITY DISCLAIMERThe Information, Software, Products and Services published on this Website may include inaccuracies or errors, including pricing errors.

out, lumpy or void of support.

enjoyed having the option to cook wholesome meals rather than dining out
all the time. So nice to kick back in front of the fireplace and eat a
leisurely home cooked meal. The bed was actually comfortable- not worn
out, lumpy or void of support.

You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.ReservationDesk.com is not liable for any costs incurred due to hotel relocation.PRIVACY POLICYReservationDesk.com Inc. believes in protecting your privacy. Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy.PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONSYou acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the ReservationDesk.com Companies and the facilitation fee retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services. You authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the ReservationDesk.com Companies' services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, the ReservationDesk.com Companies do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice the ReservationDesk.com Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the ReservationDesk.com Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the ReservationDesk.com Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you may be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation.You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.You may not book reservations for more than 9 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 9 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact ReservationDesk.com's call center. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by ReservationDesk.com for your hotel booking.BANK AND CREDIT CARD FEESSome banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since ReservationDesk.com may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.INTERNATIONAL TRAVELYou are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. ReservationDesk.com has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, RESERVATIONDESK.COM DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.LIABILITY DISCLAIMERThe Information, Software, Products and Services published on this Website may include inaccuracies or errors, including pricing errors.

This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our", and "ReservationDesk.com" refer to ReservationDesk.com, and its parent company and company affiliates, including Reservation Counter, LLC, TravelPASS Group, LLC, and Partner Fusion, Inc (collectively, the "ReservationDesk.com Companies"). The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms and Conditions" or "Agreement"). Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms and Conditions then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to the Terms and Conditions, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.USE OF THE WEBSITEAs a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that:1) you are at least 18 years of age;2) you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation;3) you will use this Website in accordance with these Terms and Conditions;4) you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act;5) you will inform such other persons about the Terms and Conditions that apply to the reservations you have made on their behalf, including all rules and restrictions applicable thereto;6) all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete; and7) if you have a ReservationDesk.com account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by you and anyone other than you.We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of these Terms and Conditions.DISPUTESReservationDesk.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy ("Claims") by contacting ReservationDesk.com Customer Support. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, travel suppliers, or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms and Conditions, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms and Conditions required arbitration.There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys' fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms and Conditions as a court would.Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator's fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to "ReservationDesk.com Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager," at TravelPASS Group, LLC., 2961 West Maple Loop Drive, Suite 300, Lehi, Utah 84043.  If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.PROHIBITED ACTIVITIESThe content and information on this Website (including, but not limited to, price and availability of travel services) as well as the infrastructure used to provide such content and information, is proprietary to us or our suppliers and providers.

You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.ReservationDesk.com is not liable for any costs incurred due to hotel relocation.PRIVACY POLICYReservationDesk.com Inc. believes in protecting your privacy. Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy.PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONSYou acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the ReservationDesk.com Companies and the facilitation fee retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services. You authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the ReservationDesk.com Companies' services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, the ReservationDesk.com Companies do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice the ReservationDesk.com Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the ReservationDesk.com Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the ReservationDesk.com Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you may be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation.You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.You may not book reservations for more than 9 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 9 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact ReservationDesk.com's call center. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by ReservationDesk.com for your hotel booking.BANK AND CREDIT CARD FEESSome banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since ReservationDesk.com may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.INTERNATIONAL TRAVELYou are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. ReservationDesk.com has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, RESERVATIONDESK.COM DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.LIABILITY DISCLAIMERThe Information, Software, Products and Services published on this Website may include inaccuracies or errors, including pricing errors.

out, lumpy or void of support.

enjoyed having the option to cook wholesome meals rather than dining out
all the time. So nice to kick back in front of the fireplace and eat a
leisurely home cooked meal. The bed was actually comfortable- not worn
out, lumpy or void of support.

Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms and Conditions then in force shall apply.

If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, travel suppliers, or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms and Conditions, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms and Conditions required arbitration.There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy.PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONSYou acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the ReservationDesk.com Companies and the facilitation fee retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services. You authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the ReservationDesk.com Companies' services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, the ReservationDesk.com Companies do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice the ReservationDesk.com Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the ReservationDesk.com Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the ReservationDesk.com Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you may be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation.You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.You may not book reservations for more than 9 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 9 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact ReservationDesk.com's call center. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by ReservationDesk.com for your hotel booking.BANK AND CREDIT CARD FEESSome banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since ReservationDesk.com may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.INTERNATIONAL TRAVELYou are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. ReservationDesk.com has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, RESERVATIONDESK.COM DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.LIABILITY DISCLAIMERThe Information, Software, Products and Services published on this Website may include inaccuracies or errors, including pricing errors.

Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy.PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONSYou acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the ReservationDesk.com Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the ReservationDesk.com Companies and the facilitation fee retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services. You authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the ReservationDesk.com Companies' services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the ReservationDesk.com Companies, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, the ReservationDesk.com Companies do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the ReservationDesk.com Companies pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice the ReservationDesk.com Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. None of the ReservationDesk.com Companies act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the ReservationDesk.com Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain service fees as additional compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees retained by the ReservationDesk.com Companies for their services vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you may be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation.You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.You may not book reservations for more than 9 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 9 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact ReservationDesk.com's call center. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by ReservationDesk.com for your hotel booking.BANK AND CREDIT CARD FEESSome banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since ReservationDesk.com may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.INTERNATIONAL TRAVELYou are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. ReservationDesk.com has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, RESERVATIONDESK.COM DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.LIABILITY DISCLAIMERThe Information, Software, Products and Services published on this Website may include inaccuracies or errors, including pricing errors.

out, lumpy or void of support.
