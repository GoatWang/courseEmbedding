Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. ("Spirit"), based in Wichita, Kansas, is the world's largest first-tier aerostructures manufacturer. The company builds several important pieces of Boeing aircraft, including the fuselage of the 737, portions of the 787 fuselage, and the cockpit section of the fuselage (referred to as "Section 41" by Boeing) of nearly all of its airliners. Spirit also produces fuselage sections and front wing spars for the Airbus A350.[1] Spirit's main competition comes from Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division,[2] UTC Aerospace Systems, Alenia, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

History[edit]
Spirit was formed when Boeing Commercial Airplanes sold its Wichita division to investment firm Onex. Boeing Defense, Space & Security retained its military business in Wichita, which lies on neighboring land. The Wichita division was responsible for construction of many important aircraft in Boeing's history, including the B-29 Superfortress, B-47 Stratojet, and B-52 Stratofortress. Spirit can trace its legacy back even further to Stearman Aircraft, which was founded on the same site; Stearman later became part of Boeing. Spirit also includes North American Aviation's former Tulsa and McAlester facilities (both in Oklahoma).
In June 2016, it was announced that Tom Gentile was named CEO, replacing Larry Lawson.[3]
Mergers[edit]
On January 31, 2006, BAE Systems announced it had agreed to sell its aerostructures business, based at Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Samlesbury Aerodrome, to Spirit.[4] The BAE unit, which was renamed Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Ltd., is a major supplier to Raytheon (5%), Airbus (80%), and Boeing (15%). The transaction was completed on April 1, 2006. Spirit paid GBP 80 million for the business.[5]
Spirit AeroSystems[edit]
In 2010, 96% of Spirit's revenue came from its two largest customers: 85% of sales were from Boeing, 11% from Airbus. In 2009 these two customers represented 96% of sales for Spirit as well.[6]
After planning to take Spirit public,[7] at initial public offering on November 21, 2006, the firm's stock rose 10% on the first day.[8] In November 2006, Onex owned 58% of Spirit, which resulted in 92% of voting power, as its shares conferred "supervoting" power.[8] The chief architect of the Onex purchase of Spirit was Nigel S. Wright, who was later Chief of Staff for the Canadian Prime Minister until his resignation as part of an expense scandal. In August 2014 the Onex Group sold all of its remaining shares of Spirit. Over the course of the nine-year investment, the Onex Group received aggregate proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion on its initial $375 million investment.[9]
Former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) serves as a labor consultant for Spirit and sits on its board of directors.[10][11]

Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. ("Spirit"), based in Wichita, Kansas, is the world's largest first-tier aerostructures manufacturer. The company builds several important pieces of Boeing aircraft, including the fuselage of the 737, portions of the 787 fuselage, and the cockpit section of the fuselage (referred to as "Section 41" by Boeing) of nearly all of its airliners. Spirit also produces fuselage sections and front wing spars for the Airbus A350.[1] Spirit's main competition comes from Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division,[2] UTC Aerospace Systems, Alenia, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

History[edit]
Spirit was formed when Boeing Commercial Airplanes sold its Wichita division to investment firm Onex. Boeing Defense, Space & Security retained its military business in Wichita, which lies on neighboring land. The Wichita division was responsible for construction of many important aircraft in Boeing's history, including the B-29 Superfortress, B-47 Stratojet, and B-52 Stratofortress. Spirit can trace its legacy back even further to Stearman Aircraft, which was founded on the same site; Stearman later became part of Boeing. Spirit also includes North American Aviation's former Tulsa and McAlester facilities (both in Oklahoma).
In June 2016, it was announced that Tom Gentile was named CEO, replacing Larry Lawson.[3]
Mergers[edit]
On January 31, 2006, BAE Systems announced it had agreed to sell its aerostructures business, based at Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Samlesbury Aerodrome, to Spirit.[4] The BAE unit, which was renamed Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Ltd., is a major supplier to Raytheon (5%), Airbus (80%), and Boeing (15%). The transaction was completed on April 1, 2006. Spirit paid GBP 80 million for the business.[5]
Spirit AeroSystems[edit]
In 2010, 96% of Spirit's revenue came from its two largest customers: 85% of sales were from Boeing, 11% from Airbus. In 2009 these two customers represented 96% of sales for Spirit as well.[6]
After planning to take Spirit public,[7] at initial public offering on November 21, 2006, the firm's stock rose 10% on the first day.[8] In November 2006, Onex owned 58% of Spirit, which resulted in 92% of voting power, as its shares conferred "supervoting" power.[8] The chief architect of the Onex purchase of Spirit was Nigel S. Wright, who was later Chief of Staff for the Canadian Prime Minister until his resignation as part of an expense scandal. In August 2014 the Onex Group sold all of its remaining shares of Spirit. Over the course of the nine-year investment, the Onex Group received aggregate proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion on its initial $375 million investment.[9]
Former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) serves as a labor consultant for Spirit and sits on its board of directors.[10][11]

Total Rewards - The benefits of working at Spirit AeroSystems extend well beyond pay. Your health, financial security, professional growth and work/life balance are important to you, so they’re important to us, too. Spirit’s Total Rewards program encompasses a wide range of benefits to help employees live better.                  

                Health                

                  It’s our goal to provide you with flexible coverage that works for your specific needs. For U.S.-based employees, that means providing comprehensive medical and dental coverage and the ability to invest in flexible spending accounts (FSA) and/or health savings accounts (HSA). For employees outside of the U.S., we offer comprehensive medical coverage, a welfare contract, and coverage for critical illness.                


                Well-being                

                  Your health and well-being are a top priority for Spirt AeroSystems. This is why we offer a range of programs designed to provide you with the tools and resources to maintain and improve your overall physical, emotional and financial wellbeing. U.S. employees have access to wellness incentive programs as well as employee assistance programs that offer resources and support in times of need.                


                Insurance                

                  We understand how important peace of mind is to achieving work/life balance, so we provide employees with a range of life insurance options at no cost with the ability to buy-up coverage as desired. We also offer a selection of short- and long-term disability insurance coverage that can be either company or self-paid.                


                Paid time off                

                  At Spirit, we believe your life outside of work is just as important as the time you spend with us, which is why strive to help you find balance through paid time off. Spirit observes a number of paid holidays throughout the year and also offers competitive time off that allows you recharge, reconnect and rebalance your life.                


                Employee recognition and incentives                

                  Recognition is a vital part of Spirit’s culture, and we have formalized a program to recognize employees for exemplary performance, commitment to our values and delivering for our customers. Short- and long-term financial incentive plans are offered as well as employee gain share and profit sharing as appropriate.                


                Savings and retirement                

                  Planning for the future can sometimes be cumbersome. Spirit’s retirement program is designed to help build personal wealth by providing flexible investment options that support the needs of you and your family upon your retirement.                


                Learning and development                

                  At Spirit, we’ve designed our professional growth and development process to help you continually improve your skills, and in doing so, prepare you for the next step in your career. We offer on-site and on-the-job training opportunities and tuition reimbursement programs and will work with you to create personal development plans to help elevate your knowledge, expertise, and level within the organization.

Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. ("Spirit"), based in Wichita, Kansas, is the world's largest first-tier aerostructures manufacturer. The company builds several important pieces of Boeing aircraft, including the fuselage of the 737, portions of the 787 fuselage, and the cockpit section of the fuselage (referred to as "Section 41" by Boeing) of nearly all of its airliners. Spirit also produces fuselage sections and front wing spars for the Airbus A350.[1] Spirit's main competition comes from Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division,[2] UTC Aerospace Systems, Alenia, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

History[edit]
Spirit was formed when Boeing Commercial Airplanes sold its Wichita division to investment firm Onex. Boeing Defense, Space & Security retained its military business in Wichita, which lies on neighboring land. The Wichita division was responsible for construction of many important aircraft in Boeing's history, including the B-29 Superfortress, B-47 Stratojet, and B-52 Stratofortress. Spirit can trace its legacy back even further to Stearman Aircraft, which was founded on the same site; Stearman later became part of Boeing. Spirit also includes North American Aviation's former Tulsa and McAlester facilities (both in Oklahoma).
In June 2016, it was announced that Tom Gentile was named CEO, replacing Larry Lawson.[3]
Mergers[edit]
On January 31, 2006, BAE Systems announced it had agreed to sell its aerostructures business, based at Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Samlesbury Aerodrome, to Spirit.[4] The BAE unit, which was renamed Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Ltd., is a major supplier to Raytheon (5%), Airbus (80%), and Boeing (15%). The transaction was completed on April 1, 2006. Spirit paid GBP 80 million for the business.[5]
Spirit AeroSystems[edit]
In 2010, 96% of Spirit's revenue came from its two largest customers: 85% of sales were from Boeing, 11% from Airbus. In 2009 these two customers represented 96% of sales for Spirit as well.[6]
After planning to take Spirit public,[7] at initial public offering on November 21, 2006, the firm's stock rose 10% on the first day.[8] In November 2006, Onex owned 58% of Spirit, which resulted in 92% of voting power, as its shares conferred "supervoting" power.[8] The chief architect of the Onex purchase of Spirit was Nigel S. Wright, who was later Chief of Staff for the Canadian Prime Minister until his resignation as part of an expense scandal. In August 2014 the Onex Group sold all of its remaining shares of Spirit. Over the course of the nine-year investment, the Onex Group received aggregate proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion on its initial $375 million investment.[9]
Former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) serves as a labor consultant for Spirit and sits on its board of directors.[10][11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. ("Spirit"), based in Wichita, Kansas, is the world's largest first-tier aerostructures manufacturer. The company builds several important pieces of Boeing aircraft, including the fuselage of the 737, portions of the 787 fuselage, and the cockpit section of the fuselage (referred to as "Section 41" by Boeing) of nearly all of its airliners. Spirit also produces fuselage sections and front wing spars for the Airbus A350.[1] Spirit's main competition comes from Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division,[2] UTC Aerospace Systems, Alenia, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

History[edit]
Spirit was formed when Boeing Commercial Airplanes sold its Wichita division to investment firm Onex. Boeing Defense, Space & Security retained its military business in Wichita, which lies on neighboring land. The Wichita division was responsible for construction of many important aircraft in Boeing's history, including the B-29 Superfortress, B-47 Stratojet, and B-52 Stratofortress. Spirit can trace its legacy back even further to Stearman Aircraft, which was founded on the same site; Stearman later became part of Boeing. Spirit also includes North American Aviation's former Tulsa and McAlester facilities (both in Oklahoma).
In June 2016, it was announced that Tom Gentile was named CEO, replacing Larry Lawson.[3]
Mergers[edit]
On January 31, 2006, BAE Systems announced it had agreed to sell its aerostructures business, based at Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Samlesbury Aerodrome, to Spirit.[4] The BAE unit, which was renamed Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Ltd., is a major supplier to Raytheon (5%), Airbus (80%), and Boeing (15%). The transaction was completed on April 1, 2006. Spirit paid GBP 80 million for the business.[5]
Spirit AeroSystems[edit]
In 2010, 96% of Spirit's revenue came from its two largest customers: 85% of sales were from Boeing, 11% from Airbus. In 2009 these two customers represented 96% of sales for Spirit as well.[6]
After planning to take Spirit public,[7] at initial public offering on November 21, 2006, the firm's stock rose 10% on the first day.[8] In November 2006, Onex owned 58% of Spirit, which resulted in 92% of voting power, as its shares conferred "supervoting" power.[8] The chief architect of the Onex purchase of Spirit was Nigel S. Wright, who was later Chief of Staff for the Canadian Prime Minister until his resignation as part of an expense scandal. In August 2014 the Onex Group sold all of its remaining shares of Spirit. Over the course of the nine-year investment, the Onex Group received aggregate proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion on its initial $375 million investment.[9]
Former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) serves as a labor consultant for Spirit and sits on its board of directors.[10][11]

Revenue
Spirit's fourth quarter 2016 revenue was $1.6 billion, down by two percent compared to the same period of 2015, primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs, partially offset by higher activity on non-recurring programs. Revenue for the full year increased two percent to $6.8 billion, primarily due to higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 XWB and Boeing 767 programs, partially offset by lower revenue recognized due to the impact of pricing terms on the Boeing 787 program and lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 program. (Table 1)
"I am proud of the way the Spirit team executed in 2016. We overcame several challenges and operationally did better than 2015. We delivered a record 1,583 shipsets compared to 1,457 shipsets in the prior year. The number includes 127 787s, 96 777s, 500 737s, 69 A350s, and 574 A320s," Gentile added.
Spirit's backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was approximately $47 billion, with work packages on all commercial platforms in the Boeing and Airbus backlog.
Earnings
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $161 million, compared to $206 million in the same period of 2015, primarily due to one-time incentive payments received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating income for the full year was $725 million, compared to $863 million in 2015, with the decrease primarily resulting from forward loss charges recognized during the second quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter reported EPS was $0.89, compared to $1.01 EPS (or $0.95 adjusted EPS* excluding the impact of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance) in the same period of 2015. Full-year EPS was $3.70 (or $4.56 adjusted EPS* excluding the impact of certain one-time items), compared to $5.66 EPS (or $3.92 adjusted EPS* excluding the impact of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance) in 2015. (Table 1) 
"In the fourth quarter, our operations in Kinston, North Carolina, were impacted by the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew resulting in higher abnormal operating costs of $12.1 million, equivalent to approximately $0.07 of EPS. We are submitting appropriate claims with our insurers," Gentile said.
Cash
Free cash flow* in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $45 million, compared to $177 million (or adjusted free cash flow* of $131 million, adjusted to remove the impact of the 787 interim pricing agreement) in the same quarter last year. Full-year free cash flow* was $463 million, compared to $930 million in 2015. Full-year adjusted free cash flow* (adjusted to remove the impact of the 787 interim pricing agreement) was $420 million in 2016, compared to $738 million in 2015. (Table 2) 
Cash balance at the end of the year was $698 million, reflecting the purchase of 14.2 million common shares for $650 million during the year. The company's $650 million revolving credit facility remained undrawn at the end of the year.
"Despite no share repurchases in the fourth quarter due to the uncertainty from the presidential election and our limited trading window, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. We have our entire authorization of up to $600 million available as we enter 2017," Gentile commented.

Segment Results
Fuselage Systems
Fuselage Systems segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $819 million, which was slightly lower than the same period last year, due to lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs, partially offset by higher production deliveries on the Boeing 737 and 767 programs and higher activity on non-recurring programs. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 15.6 percent as compared to 17.5 percent during the same period of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recorded pretax ($6.8) million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs and net forward losses of ($0.4) million. 
Propulsion Systems
Propulsion Systems segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased seven percent from the same period last year to $404 million, driven by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs and lower net revenues recognized on the Boeing 787 program in accordance with pricing terms, partially offset by higher revenue recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 18.6 percent as compared to 22.8 percent during the same period of 2015. Year-over-year change was primarily driven by one-time incentive payments received in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the segment recorded pretax $3.0 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs and $4.1 million of favorable changes in estimates on forward loss programs.
Wing Systems
Wing Systems segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 slightly decreased by one percent from the same period last year to $347 million, primarily due to lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 program, lower wing-related activity on the Boeing 777 program and lower non-recurring revenue on certain Boeing programs, partially offset by higher net revenues recognized on the Boeing 787 due to model mix. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 14.1 percent as compared to 10.7 percent during the same period of 2015. Year-over-year change was primarily driven by charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the segment recorded pretax $7.6 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" that may involve many risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "intend," "may," "plan," "project," "should," "will," and other similar words, or phrases, or the negative thereof, unless the context requires otherwise. These statements reflect management's current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown. Our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements and that should be considered in evaluating our outlook include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) our ability to continue to grow our business and execute our growth strategy, including the timing, execution, and profitability of new and maturing programs; 2) our ability to perform our obligations and manage costs related to our new and maturing commercial, business aircraft and military development programs and the related recurring production; 3) margin pressures and the potential for additional forward losses on new and maturing programs; 4) our ability to accommodate, and the cost of accommodating, announced increases in the build rates of certain aircraft; 5) the effect on aircraft demand and build rates of changing customer preferences for business aircraft, including the effect of global economic conditions on the business aircraft market and expanding conflicts or political unrest in the Middle East or Asia; 6) customer cancellations or deferrals as a result of global economic uncertainty; 7) the effect of economic conditions in the industries and markets in which we operate in the U.S. and globally and any changes therein, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 8) the success and timely execution of key milestones such as receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and customer adherence to their announced schedules; 9) our ability to successfully negotiate future pricing under our supply agreements with Boeing and our other customers; 10) our ability to enter into profitable supply arrangements with additional customers; 11) the ability of all parties to satisfy their performance requirements under existing supply contracts with our two major customers, Boeing and Airbus, and other customers, and the risk of nonpayment by such customers; 12) any adverse impact on Boeing's and Airbus' production of aircraft resulting from cancellations, deferrals or reduced orders by their customers or from labor disputes or acts of terrorism; 13) any adverse impact on the demand for air travel or our operations from the outbreak of diseases or epidemic or pandemic outbreaks; 14) our ability to avoid or recover from cyber-based or other security attacks, information technology failures or other disruptions; 15) returns on pension plan assets and the impact of future discount rate changes on pension obligations; 16) our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance debt; 17) competition from commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturers and other aerostructures suppliers; 18) the effect of governmental laws, such as U.S. export control laws and U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and environmental laws and agency regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad; 19) any reduction in our credit ratings; 20) our dependence on our suppliers, as well as the cost and availability of raw materials and purchased components; 21) our ability to recruit and retain highly-skilled employees and our relationships with the unions representing many of our employees; 22) spending by the U.S. and other governments on defense; 23) the possibility that our cash flows and borrowing facilities may not be adequate for our additional capital needs or for payment of interest on and principal of our indebtedness; 24) our exposure under our existing senior revolving credit facility to higher interest payments should interest rates increase substantially; 25) the effectiveness of any interest rate hedging programs; 26) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; 27) the outcome or impact of ongoing or future litigation, claims and regulatory actions; and 28) exposure to potential product liability and warranty claims. These factors are not exhaustive and it is not possible for us to predict all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. These factors speak only as of the date hereof, and new factors may emerge or changes to the foregoing factors may occur that could impact our business. As with any projection or forecast, these statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Appendix
Management believes that the non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures (indicated by *) used in this report provide investors with important perspectives into the company's ongoing business performance. The company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently.
Free cash flow is defined as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. 
Management considers special items, which may include termination charges, settlement charges and other items that arise from time to time, to be outside the ordinary course of our operations. Management believes that excluding these items provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company's operating results to historical performance. The tables below provide reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures which have been adjusted for special items.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
