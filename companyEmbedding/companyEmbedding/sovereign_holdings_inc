                                         said Wednesday that seven executives, including Chairman, President and Chief Executive Michael S. Gilliland, will invest in Sovereign Holdings Inc. as part of Sabre's takeover by two private-equity firms. Sovereign Holdings is owned by investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners and TPG Inc., the former Texas Pacific Group. Last December, Sabre agreed to be acquired by Silver Lake Partners and TPG in a $5 billion buyout. Sabre Holdings said the executives, and other managers who have the opportunity to invest in the new company, will hold a total of no more than 2% of Sovereign Holdings' stock, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The executives, who entered into rollover agreements with Sovereign Holdings on Tuesday, will invest cash or Sabre equity, or a combination of both, in exchange for shares of the new company. The Southlake, Texas, travel-booking company said that if its other managers decide to invest in Sovereign Holdings, each manager must invest at least $50,000 and must roll over all or a portion of his shares of Sabre common stock into Sovereign. Sabre Holdings said the managers have until noon Thursday EDT to roll over their Sabre shares into Sovereign Holdings' account. The company said that although a delay is possible, it expects to complete the merger with Silver Lake Partners and TPG on Friday. Shares of Sabre Holdings closed Tuesday at $32.65. -Contact: 201-938-5400

No Offer or Solicitation This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to sell, or the solicitation or an offer to buy any securities. There will be no sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirement of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Veritex Holdings' management with respect to, among other things, future events and Veritex Holdings' financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "project," "forecast," "goal," "target," "would" and "outlook," or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Veritex Holdings' industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Veritex Holdings' control. Accordingly, Veritex Holdings cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Veritex believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Veritex Holdings' expectations include successfully implementing its growth strategy, including identifying acquisition targets and consummating suitable acquisitions;  continuing to sustain internal growth rate; providing competitive products and services that appeal to its customers and target market; continuing to have access to debt and equity capital markets and achieving its performance goals. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to "Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in Veritex Holdings' Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2016 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Veritex Holdings' subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Veritex Holdings' underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Veritex Holdings anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Veritex does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for Veritex Holdings to predict those events or how they may affect it. In addition, Veritex cannot assess the impact of each factor on Veritex Holdings' business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Veritex Holdings or persons acting on Veritex Holdings' behalf may issue.
