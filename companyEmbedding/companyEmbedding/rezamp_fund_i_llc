About



There are three unique real estate entities that use the “Rezamp” brand. The first is Rezamp, LLC which is a software based company that uses big data to find and analyze investment properties. The second Rezamp Lending, LLC is a licensed mortgage bank in Arizona that is actively engaged in the specialty finance business commonly known as ‘hard money, asset based lending, or equity based lending.’ Hard money loans are characterized by high interest rates and short term maturities, typically of 6 months or less, and are secured by a first priority position deed of trust (or mortgage) on the property. Thirdly, is Rezamp Fund I, LLC (“RFI”) which was created as holding company used to originate loans under Rezamp Lending, LLC.
