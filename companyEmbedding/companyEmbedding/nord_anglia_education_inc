HONG KONG, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nord Anglia Education, Inc. (NYSE:    NORD) ("Nord Anglia Education" or the "Company"), the world's leading premium schools organization, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Bach Finance Limited ("Parent") and Bach Acquisitions Limited ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to which Nord Anglia Education will be acquired by Parent in a transaction valued at approximately $4.3 billion, including the repayment of debt. Immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Closing"), Parent will be beneficially owned by a consortium (the "Buyer Consortium") led by funds affiliated with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB") and funds affiliated with Baring Private Equity Asia ("BPEA").








Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each ordinary share of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (each a "Share") will be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive $32.50 in cash without interest, except for (a) (i) 69,613,389 Shares beneficially owned by Premier Education Holdings Ltd or its transferee and (ii) Shares held by Parent, the Company or any of their subsidiaries, each of which will be cancelled and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor, (b) certain shares of restricted stock granted under the 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan of the Company, which will be converted into rights to receive shares in Bach Manco Limited, an indirect majority shareholder of Parent, and (c) Shares held by shareholders who have validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to dissent from the merger, or dissenter rights, in accordance with Section 238 of the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands (the "Dissenting Shares"), which will be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive the payment of appraised fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 238 of the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands. 
The merger consideration per Share represents a premium of 18 percent over Nord Anglia Education's closing share price of $27.62 on April 24, 2017 and a premium of approximately 33 percent over the average closing share price during the 90 calendar days ended April 24, 2017.
The board of directors of Nord Anglia Education (the "Board"), acting on the recommendation of a special committee of independent and disinterested directors unaffiliated with CPPIB or BPEA (the "Special Committee"), has authorized and approved the Merger Agreement and resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders vote to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the merger. The Special Committee negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors.
The merger agreement provides for a so‑called "go‑shop" period, during which the Special Committee will actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. The initial go-shop period is 30 days, following which period, the Special Committee will be permitted to continue discussions and enter into or recommend a transaction with any person or group that submitted a qualifying proposal during such 30-day period. 
The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash contributed by CPPIB and BPEA and third party financing underwritten by a group of financial institutions. There is no financing condition to the Closing.
The transaction is subject to customary conditions including the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger by the affirmative vote of holders of Shares representing at least two-thirds of the voting power of the Shares present and voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of the Company's shareholders convened to consider the Merger Agreement and the merger. Premier Education Holdings Ltd, an affiliate of BPEA that currently holds approximately 67 percent of the Company's Shares, has agreed to vote all of such Shares in favor of the authorization and approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger. The transaction is currently expected to close before the end of Nord Anglia Education's fiscal year ending August 31, 2017. If completed, the merger will result in the Company becoming a privately-owned company and its Shares will no longer be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In connection with the merger, Houlihan Lokey is serving as financial advisor to the Special Committee; Kirkland & Ellis is serving as U.S. legal counsel to the Special Committee; Maples and Calder is serving as Cayman Islands legal counsel to the Special Committee; and Latham & Watkins is serving as U.S. legal counsel to the Company.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges is serving as U.S. legal counsel to the Buyer Consortium; and Walkers is serving as Cayman Islands legal counsel to the Buyer Consortium. 
Ropes & Gray is serving as U.S. legal counsel to CPPIB.
Nord Anglia Education will furnish to the SEC a report on Form 6-K regarding the proposed transaction described in this announcement, which will include the merger agreement.

HONG KONG, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nord Anglia Education, Inc. (NYSE:   NORD), the world's leading premium schools organization, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the three month period ended May 31, 2017.








Third quarter FY2017 highlights (compared to third quarter FY2016) 

Average full time equivalent students (FTEs) increased 8.4% to 38,287 
Revenue of $272.2 million, up 7.4% on a reported basis and up 9.6% on a constant currency basis 
Adjusted EBITDA of $69.3 million, down 0.2% on a reported basis but up 2.1% on a constant currency basis 
Adjusted Net Income increased 2.9% to $29.3 million 
Diluted Adjusted EPS increased 0.9% to $0.28

Year to date May 31, 2017 highlights (compared to year to date May 31, 2016)

Revenue of $792.2 million, up 7.0% on a reported basis and up 8.8% on a constant currency basis 
Adjusted EBITDA of $199.5 million, down 0.5% on a reported basis but up 1.4% on a constant currency 
Adjusted Net Income increased 2.7% to $84.2 million 
Diluted Adjusted EPS increased 1.1% to $0.80

"We are pleased with our third quarter results," said Andrew Fitzmaurice, Chief Executive Officer of Nord Anglia Education. "We finished the 2016/2017 academic year with 38,754 full-time equivalent students, representing enrollment growth of 9.7% over the prior year. This is a very exciting time of the year for Nord Anglia as we celebrate the achievements of our students. Recently, 87 students participated in a special side meeting at the UN High-level Political Forum in New York, presenting to the President of the UN General Assembly and UN Membership about the work our schools have undertaken over the last academic year to support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We would also like to congratulate our IB Diploma students who achieved a pass rate of 94% and an average score of 33.4 points, significantly higher than the world average. We are proud of the progress we have achieved this year and look forward to continuing our ambitious approach to support the success of our students and teachers in the coming years."
Third Quarter FY2017 Results
Average FTEs increased 8.4% to 38,287 in the three months ended May 31, 2017 ("Q3 FY2017") from 35,309 in the three months ended May 31, 2016 ("Q3 FY2016"). Average capacity and utilization were 55,750 seats and 69%, respectively, in Q3 FY2017 compared to 49,402 seats and 71%, respectively, in Q3 FY2016.
Revenue increased 7.4%, or $18.7 million, to $272.2 million in Q3 FY2017 from $253.5 million in Q3 FY2016. This increase was due primarily to higher revenues from premium schools, partly offset by the impact of the strengthening US dollar on our premium schools revenue. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 9.6% in Q3 FY2017, compared to Q3 FY2016. Revenue per FTE was approximately $7,100 in Q3 FY2017, unchanged from Q3 FY2016. 
Gross profit increased 5.7%, or $5.8 million, to $106.7 million in Q3 FY2017 from $100.9 million in Q3 FY2016. Gross profit margin was 39.2% in Q3 FY2017 compared to 39.8% in Q3 FY2016. The reduction in gross profit margin in Q3 FY2017 was primarily due to the additional rent included in cost of sales from the sale and leaseback transactions completed during Q3 FY2016 and the new school openings in September 2016, partially offset by tuition fee increases in excess of cost inflation and increased FTEs within our schools.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13.5% to $55.1 million in Q3 FY2017 from $48.5 million in Q3 FY2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was mainly due to the operating expenses of the new schools opened in September 2016, pre-opening costs associated with the opening of new campuses in Houston, Abu Dhabi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, Global Campus related costs and Sarbanes-Oxley project costs.
Other (losses)/gains changed by $2.4 million from a loss of $10.1 million in Q3 FY2016 to a loss of $7.7 million in Q3 FY2017. In Q3 FY2017, other (losses)/gains included $3.7 million of non-cash foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances and $4.0 million non-cash losses on financial instruments including a $3.1 million loss on the cross currency swaps and a $0.9 million loss on embedded lease derivatives and other options. In Q3 FY2016, other (losses)/gains included $6.3 million of non-cash foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances and $3.8 million non-cash losses on financial instruments including a $3.2 million loss on the cross currency swaps and a $0.6 million loss on embedded lease derivatives and other options.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.2%, or $0.2 million, to $69.3 million in Q3 FY2017 from Q3 FY2016. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 2.1% in Q3 FY2017.
Net financing expense increased $3.4 million from $19.2 million in Q3 FY2016 to $22.6 million in Q3 FY2017 primarily due to an unrealized loss of $7.0 million in Q3 FY2017 compared to an unrealized loss of $2.0 million in Q3 FY2016 on the revaluation of the CHF 200.0 million bonds, partially offset by the reduction in interest margin on our term loan from December 2016 and the revolving credit facility remaining undrawn in Q3 FY2017.
Adjusted Net Income increased 2.9% to $29.3 million in Q3 FY2017 from $28.5 million in Q3 FY2016.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow 
Cash used in operating activities was $81.1 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2017, compared to $54.1 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Cash used in operations was $18.6 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 compared to cash generated from operations of $14.3 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 as a result of working capital changes, primarily a reduction in trade and other payables. The increased outflow was primarily due to the impact of a larger cost base as the business has grown. Interest paid decreased from $44.5 million to $38.8 million, and tax paid increased from $18.9 million to $21.0 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2017, respectively. The reduction in interest paid for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 was primarily due to the revolving credit facility remaining undrawn compared to a drawn balance of $28.0 million as at May 31, 2016 and a reduced margin from December 2016 from 4.0% to 3.5% on the term loan. The outflows were in line with expectations.
Cash used in investing activities was $62.2 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 compared to cash generated from investing activities of $74.1 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. The outflow for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 included a $27.6 million outflow for the acquisition of subsidiaries (net of cash acquired), including the acquisition of the Prague British School for $14.2 million net of cash acquired and $13.5 million deferred payments for the Cambodia and Vietnam acquisitions, $44.9 million of capital expenditures in relation to the new campuses in Houston, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and the new China bilingual school in Shanghai, and general maintenance capital expenditure, offset by net sale proceeds of $8.9 million in relation to the sale of the old Houston campus. The inflow for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $167.0 million inflow from the proceeds of the sale and leaseback transaction and a $33.6 million outflow for the acquisition of subsidiaries (net of cash acquired), including the final deferred payment for the Meritas acquisition, and capital expenditures of $60.0 million.
Cash used in financing activities was $8.4 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 compared to cash generated from financing activities of $19.4 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. The outflow for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 was primarily due to repayment of borrowings of $6.8 million and payments to non-controlling interests of $1.8 million. The inflow for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was primarily due to net drawings on the revolving credit facility of $28.0 million.
Cash and cash equivalents (excluding the bank overdraft on our notional pooling accounts) as of May 31, 2017 were $265.9 million, compared to $376.6 million as of May 31, 2016.
Cash and cash equivalents (including the bank overdraft on our notional pooling accounts) as of May 31, 2017 were $216.8 million, compared to $260.5 million as of May 31, 2016.
Recent Developments
As previously disclosed, we have called an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the "EGM") to be held on August 21, 2017 to consider and vote on, among other matters, the proposal to authorize and approve the agreement and plan of merger announced on April 25, 2017.  Additional information about the EGM and the merger agreement can be found in the transaction statement on Schedule 13E-3 and the proxy statement attached thereto as Exhibit (a)-(1) filed with the SEC.
On July 5, 2017, we completed the acquisition of an international school in Latin America to take our total number of schools to 46.  The school currently educates more than 820 FTEs with 870 seats of capacity.  The consideration of approximately $30.0 million (with $10.0 million deferred) for the school was within Nord Anglia Education's targeted range of 7-10x trailing EBITDA.
On May 11, 2017, we acquired effective control of and 100% economic interest in the Netherlands Inter-community School in Jakarta, Indonesia for approximately $0.7 million.  With over 160 FTEs and 300 seats of capacity, the school is expected to be EBITDA breakeven in fiscal 2017 and provides us entry into a high growth market in Southeast Asia.
We have not resolved objections raised by the Hong Kong Lands Department with respect to the new campus for Nord Anglia International School Hong Kong and therefore do not expect to open the new campus in September 2017.  To provide parents with a solution, we have secured two sites in Hong Kong with a combined capacity of 436 seats.  Both sites will cater to children aged three to five years old and are planned to open in September 2017.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements that express our current opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, "forward looking statements".  These forward looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "believe," "expect," "may," "will," "should," "seek," "project," "approximately," "intend," "plan," "estimate" or "anticipate," or, in each case, their negatives or other variations or comparable terminology.  These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts.  They appear in a number of places throughout this press release and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning among other things, anticipated school openings, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which we operate.
By their nature, forward-looking statements relate to events that involve risks and uncertainties or that depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.  We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those under "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.
Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, growth prospects, strategies and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.  In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, growth prospects, strategies and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.  Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  Any forward-looking statement that we make in this press release speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments.
Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures
We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share, as supplemental financial measures of our operating performance. We define EBITDA as (loss)/profit for the period plus income tax expense, net financing (expense)/income, exceptional items, impairment of goodwill, amortization and depreciation, and we define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for loss/(gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment, share based payments, realised gains or losses on hedging agreements and other items. We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for depreciation, net financing expense, income tax expense, tax adjustments and non-controlling interests. We define Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary share as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the period.  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share are not standard measures under IFRS. These measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to cash flows, net income, earnings per ordinary share or any other measure of financial performance or as indicators of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities. We may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and certain of these items could be recurring. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 KEY OPERATING DATA AND SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL DATA 





 Key Operating Data 





      We use the following key operating metrics to manage our schools: full-time equivalent students ("FTEs"), capacity, utilization and revenue per FTE. We monitor FTEs on a weekly basis and the other operating metrics on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, as we believe that they are the most reliable metrics for measuring the profitability of our schools. The table below sets out our key operating data for the periods indicated:

 (1)  We calculate average FTEs for a period by dividing the total number of FTEs at each calendar month end in the period by the number of calendar months in the period.  


 (2)  We calculate average capacity for a period as the total number of FTEs that can be accommodated in a school based on its existing classrooms at each academic calendar month divided by the number of months in such period. 


 (3)  We calculate utilization during a period as a percentage equal to the ratio of average FTEs for the period divided by average capacity for the period.  


 (4)  We calculate revenue per FTE by dividing our revenue from our schools for the period by the average FTEs for the period.

 We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share as supplemental financial measures of our operating performance. We define EBITDA as profit for the period plus income tax expense, net financing expense, exceptional items, other losses/(gains), impairment of goodwill, amortization and depreciation, and we define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the items set forth in the table below. We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the items in the table below.  We define Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary share as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the period. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share are not standard measures under IFRS. These measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to cash flows, net income, earnings per ordinary share or any other measure of financial performance or as indicators of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities. We may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and certain of these items could be recurring. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Ordinary Share presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Why Nord Anglia Education Inc. Jumped 18% Tuesday Morning
The premium education specialist is going private in a $4.3 billion deal.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Apr 25, 2017 at 12:56PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of private school system operator  Nord Anglia Education (NYSE:NORD) jumped as much as 18.5% higher in Tuesday's morning session.
So what
A consortium of private equity firms, led by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Baring Private Equity Asia, is taking Nord Anglia private in a $4.3 billion all-cash deal. The buyout price represents an 18% premium over Nord Anglia's share price as of Monday night, and a 33% increase over the stock's three-month average pricing.

Image source: Nord Anglia.






Now what
Unanimously approved by the company's board of directors, the deal is still subject to the usual set of closing conditions, including a vote by Nord Anglia shareholders. However, share prices immediately shot right up to the proposed takeout price of $32.50 per share. Investors are acting as if the ink were already drying on the final John Hancock, leaving little room for improvement unless the company can drum up a bidding war.
But that's an unlikely scenario given that Nord Anglia shares have soared 50% higher in less than six months. The stock trades at 62 times trailing earnings and 21 times EBITDA profits, so the bidding consortium is already willing to pay a stiff premium for the company.

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:

Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:

Nord Anglia Education schools in China are among the first to receive the new Juilliard-Nord Anglia Performing Arts program in their schools thanks to the growing demand in the region for the institute.[39]

Nord Anglia Education, commonly referred to as Nord Anglia, is a provider of international schools.[1] Nord Anglia Education operates 44 schools globally for children between the ages of 2 and 18, with over 38,000 students across 15 countries. Roughly 64% of students come from expat families while 36% are children of local families.[2]
Nord Anglia schools educate children at preschool, primary, and secondary level (also referred to in the US as preschool, elementary, middle and high school). Most schools within the organization follow a curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England Schools offering IGCSEs and the International Baccalaureate.[3] In some locations, A-levels, the French Baccalaureate and the Swiss Maturité are also offered.
Originally headquartered in the UK, Nord Anglia Education moved its central operations to Hong Kong in 2012. It currently employs over 8200 people around the world.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School to enrich performing arts education for nursery to year 13 students in its schools. One year after, Nord Anglia Education announced a new approach to teaching the interdisciplinary subjects of STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) in collaboration with MIT. The collaboration is being piloted in 13 schools for the 2016/17 academic year and will be expanded to all schools in the 2017/18 academic year.[4]

History[edit]
Nord Anglia Education was founded in 1972 by Kevin McNeany[5] to teach English as a foreign language. The company grew in the 1970s to the 1980s before moving into the UK education market. Soon after, it entered the Eastern and Central Europe market. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group also built up a substantial day care and nursery business in addition to its Learning Services arm.[6]
In 2003, Andrew Fitzmaurice joined Nord Anglia Education as CEO. By 2008, Nord Anglia Education sold its nursery business and was mainly focused on premium international schools.[7]
In 2012, the group relocated to Hong Kong to complement growth plans in China and Southeast Asia. In 2013, Nord Anglia acquired World Class Learning Group (WCL)[8] entering the North American market while strengthening its presence in Europe and the Middle East. Through the acquisition of WCL's nine schools, Nord Anglia gained a foothold in the US, Qatar and Spain markets.[9]
Nord Anglia Education's initial public offering took place on March 26, 2014 on the NYSE.
In 2015, Nord Anglia Education announced it acquired six schools from Meritas.[10] This includes four schools in North America, one in Switzerland, and one in China. The Meritas schools are Collège du Léman, Léman International School - Chengdu, San Roberto International School, The Village School, North Broward Preparatory School in Florida, and Windermere Preparatory School in Florida.[11]
In February 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced that it would develop a new international school in Abu Dhabi with a capacity for 2,250 students. The campus will be located close to the central business district and is expected to open in September 2017.[12]
Educational philosophy[edit]
Nord Anglia Education's philosophy is "Be Ambitious." According to the company's CEO, Andrew Fitzmaurice, the group's schools aim to develop the child "intellectually, culturally and emotionally."[13] Each school adapts its learning model to suit each individual child, building on their strengths and supporting them to build the skills necessary to succeed in university and in the workplace.[14]
The organization announced a collaboration with The Juilliard School in 2015 with the intention to "nurture students' ambitions through a broad education."[15]
Curriculum[edit]
Nord Anglia Education schools offers a combination of curricula depending on the country, region and student population. Many Nord Anglia schools offer a curriculum based on the English National Curriculum until the age of 16, followed by the globally recognized International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Several schools in Asia and Europe offer dual-curriculum and bilingual programs.

Student academic achievement[edit]
Nord Anglia schools are non-selective, but have strong academic track records.[16]
IGCSE[edit]
47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.[17]
International Baccalaureate[edit]
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.[18]
Global Campus[edit]
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world.[19] The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.[20]
Collaborations[edit]
The Juilliard School[edit]
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists.[21] It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.[22]
King's College London[edit]
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020.[23] Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016.[24] The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers.[25] The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.[26]
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)[edit]
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide.[27] Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum[28] The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.[29]
Student profile[edit]
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.[30]
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.[31]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.[32]
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester;[33] and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).[34]
Staff development[edit]
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 44 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development.[35] Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.[36]
School facilities[edit]
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:
