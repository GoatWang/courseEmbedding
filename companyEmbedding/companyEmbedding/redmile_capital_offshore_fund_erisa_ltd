Designation set forth the totality of the procedures required of
the Purchasers in order to convert the Preferred
Stock.  No additional legal opinion, other information or
instructions shall be required of the Purchasers to convert their
Preferred Stock. The Company shall honor conversions of the
Preferred Stock and shall deliver the Underlying Shares in
accordance with the terms, conditions and time periods set forth in
the Transaction Documents, provided, however , that the
Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock
to a Purchaser upon conversion by such Purchaser (or its assigns)
of any shares of the Preferred Stock to the extent (and only to the
extent) that such conversion would result in the Purchaser
(including its predecessors-in-interest) beneficially owning shares
of Common Stock in excess of the applicable Threshold Amount unless
approved by the Corporation’s stockholders in accordance with
the applicable stockholder approval requirements of Nasdaq
Marketplace Rule 5635.

(v) Litigation
.  Other than as may be disclosed in the Company’s
most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act, there
is no action, suit, notice of inquiry, violation, Proceeding or

(federal, state, county, local or foreign) (collectively, an
“ Action ”) which (i) adversely affects or
challenges the legality, validity or enforceability of any of the
Transaction Documents or the Shares or the Underlying Shares or
(ii) would, if there were an unfavorable decision, have or
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any
director or officer thereof, is or has been the subject of any
Action involving a claim of violation of or liability under federal
or state securities laws or a claim of breach of fiduciary
duty.  To the knowledge of the Company, there has not

by the Commission involving the Company or any current or former
director or officer of the Company.  The Commission has
not issued any stop order or other order suspending the
effectiveness of any registration statement filed by the Company or
any Subsidiary under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act.

(w) Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements . There is no transaction, arrangement, or other
relationship between the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and an
unconsolidated or other off balance sheet entity that is required
to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act filings and is
not so disclosed or that otherwise could be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

.  No brokerage or finder’s fees or commissions are
or will be payable by the Purchasers to any broker, financial
advisor or consultant, finder, placement agent (including the
Placement Agent), investment banker, bank or other Person with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.  The Purchasers shall have no obligation with

facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Shares, (ii) sold, bid
for, purchased, or, paid any compensation for soliciting purchases
of, any of the Shares, or (iii) paid or agreed to pay to any Person
any compensation for soliciting another to purchase any
other

Securities.

 3.2 Representations and Warranties of the
Purchasers .  Each Purchaser hereby, for itself
and for no other Purchaser, represents and warrants as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date to the Company as
follows:

(a) Organization; Authority
.  Such Purchaser is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization with the requisite corporate or partnership power
and authority to enter into and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the applicable Transaction Documents and otherwise
to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Purchaser and
performance by such Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
or, if such Purchaser is not a corporation, such partnership,
limited liability company or other applicable like action, on the
part of such Purchaser.  Each Transaction Document to
which it is a party has been duly executed by such Purchaser, and
when delivered by such Purchaser in accordance with the terms
hereof, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of
such Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or
similar laws relating to, or affecting generally the enforcement
of, creditors’ rights and remedies or by other equitable
principles of general application.

(b) No Conflicts
.  The execution, delivery and performance by such
Purchaser of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement,
if applicable, and the consummation by such Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i) result in
a violation of the organizational documents of such Purchaser, (ii)
conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture or instrument to which
such Purchaser is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment  or decree
(including federal and state securities laws) applicable to such
Purchaser, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for
such conflicts, defaults, rights or violations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the ability of such Purchaser to perform
its obligations hereunder.

(c) Investment Intent
.  Such Purchaser understands that the Shares and the
Underlying Shares (collectively, the “
Securities ”) are “restricted
securities” and have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any applicable state securities law.  Such
Purchaser is acquiring the Securities as principal for its own
account and does not presently have any agreement, plan or
understanding, directly or indirectly, with any Person to
distribute or effect any distribution of any of the Securities (or
any securities which are derivatives thereof) to or through any
person or entity; such Purchaser is not a registered broker-dealer
under Section 15 of the Exchange Act or an entity engaged in a
business that would require it to be so registered as a
broker-dealer.  Such Purchaser is acquiring the
Securities hereunder in the ordinary course of its
business.

 (d) Purchaser Status .  At the
time such Purchaser was offered the Securities, it was, and at the
date hereof it is, an “accredited investor” as defined
in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. Purchaser

 


 

hereby represents that neither it
nor any of its Rule 506(d) Related Parties is a “bad
actor” within the meaning of Rule 506(d) promulgated under
the Securities Act. For purposes of this Agreement, “
Rule 506(d) Related Party ” shall mean a person
or entity covered by the “Bad Actor disqualification”
provision of Rule 506(d) of the Securities Act.  Such
Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Securities and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete
loss of such investment.

(e) General Solicitation
.  Such Purchaser is not purchasing the Securities as a
result of any advertisement, article, notice or other communication
regarding the Securities published in any newspaper, magazine or
similar media or broadcast over television or radio or presented at
any seminar or any other general advertisement.

(f) Access to Information
.  Such Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that, with the
assistance of its advisors, it has conducted and completed its own
investigation, analysis and evaluation related to the investment in
the Securities.  Such Purchaser has received or has had
full access to all the information it considers necessary or
appropriate to make an informed investment decision with respect to
the Securities.  No such investigation, analysis and
evaluation nor any other due diligence investigation conducted by
such Purchaser shall modify, limit or otherwise affect such
Purchaser’s right to rely on the Company’s
representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement.

(g) Certain Trading
Activities .  Other than with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein, since September 22, 2016, neither
the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of such Purchaser which (x) had
knowledge of the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) has or
shares discretion relating to such Purchaser’s investments or
trading or information concerning such Purchaser’s
investments, including in respect of the Securities, and (z) is
subject to such Purchaser’s review or input concerning such
Affiliate’s investments or trading (collectively, “
Trading Affiliates ”) has directly or
indirectly, nor has any Person acting on behalf of or pursuant to
any understanding with such Purchaser or Trading Affiliate,
effected or agreed to effect any purchases or sales of the
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Short
Sales involving the Company’s securities). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser and/or Trading Affiliate
that is, individually or collectively, a multi-managed investment
bank or vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate
portions of such Purchaser’s or Trading Affiliate’s
assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the
investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other
portions of such Purchaser’s or Trading Affiliate’s
assets, the representation set forth above shall apply only with
respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager
that have knowledge about the financing transaction contemplated by
this Agreement.  Other than to other Persons party to
this Agreement, such Purchaser has maintained the confidentiality
of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction
(including the existence and terms of this transaction).

(h) Brokers and Finders
.  No Person will have, as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any valid right, interest or claim
against or upon the Company or any Purchaser for any commission,
fee or other compensation pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into by or on behalf of the Purchaser other
than the fees of Leerink Partners (the “ Placement
Agent ”) to be paid by the Company.

 


 

 (i) Reliance on Exemptions
.  Such Purchaser understands that the Securities being
offered and sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the
registration requirements of United States federal and state
securities laws and that the Company is relying in part upon the
truth and accuracy of, and such Purchaser’s compliance with,
the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgements and
understandings of such Purchaser set forth herein in order to
determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility
of such Purchaser to acquire the Securities.

(j) Regulation M.  
Such Purchaser is aware that the anti-manipulation rules of
Regulation M may apply to sales of Common Stock and other
activities with respect to the Common Stock by the
Purchasers.

(k) Beneficial Ownership
.  The purchase by such Purchaser of the Securities
issuable to it at the Closing will not result in such Purchaser
(individually or together with any other Person with whom such
Purchaser has identified, or will have identified, itself as part
of a “group” in a public filing made with the
Commission involving the Company’s securities) acquiring, or
obtaining the right to acquire, in excess of 19.999% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or the voting power of the
Company on a post transaction basis that assumes that the Closing
shall have occurred.  Such Purchaser does not presently
intend to, alone or together with others, make a public filing with
the Commission to disclose that it has (or that it together with
such other Persons have) acquired, or obtained the right to
acquire, as a result of the Closing (when added to any other
securities of the Company that it or they then own or have the
right to acquire), in excess of 19.999% of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock or the voting power of the Company on a post
transaction basis that assumes that the Closing shall have
occurred. A Purchaser shall not be deemed to have acquired, or have
the right to acquire, any shares of Common Stock in excess of the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined in the Certificate of
Designation) prior to the sixty-first (61st) day after the
Purchaser’s delivery of a Notice of Conversion under the
Certificate of Designation.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall at all times be required to issue the
applicable number of shares of Common Stock to a given Purchaser
upon the valid conversion by such Purchaser (or its assigns) of
shares of Class A Preferred Stock unless and only to the extent
that such conversion and related issuance: (i) would result in
the aggregate issuance to a given Purchaser (including its
predecessors-in-interest) of a number of shares of Common Stock in
excess of the applicable Threshold Amount, and (ii) has not be
approved by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the
stockholder approval requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule
5635.

(l) Residency
.  Such Purchaser’s residence (if an individual) or
offices in which its investment decision with respect to the
Securities was made (if an entity) are located at the address
immediately below such Purchaser’s name on its signature page
hereto.

The Company and each of the
Purchasers acknowledge and agree that no party to this Agreement
has made or makes any representations or warranties with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically
set forth in this Article III and the Transaction
Documents.

IV , each Purchaser covenants that the Securities may be
disposed of only pursuant to an effective registration statement
under, and in compliance with the requirements of, the Securities
Act, or pursuant to an available exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the

be sold pursuant to such rule), the Company may require the
Purchaser to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected
by the Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form
and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require
registration of such transferred Securities under the Securities
Act.

(b) Legends .  Any
certificates or book entry notations evidencing the Securities
shall bear any legend as required by the “blue sky”
laws of any state and a restrictive legend in substantially the
following form, until such time as they are not required under
Section 4.1(c) :

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“SECURITIES ACT”), OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS
AND ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE
SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED NOVEMBER 21, 2016 AND A
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, DATED NOVEMBER 21, 2016, IN EACH
CASE BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY AND THE STOCKHOLDERS NAMED
THEREIN.  THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE,
SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OR (B) AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A
TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES

REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS TRANSFER AGENT OR
(II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT.

  (c) Removal of Legends .  The
legend set forth in Section 4.1(b) above shall be removed

as applicable) without such legend or any other legend to the
holder of the applicable Securities upon which it is stamped or
issue to such holder by electronic delivery at the applicable
balance account at the Depository Trust Company (“ DTC
”), if (i) such Securities are registered for resale under
the Securities Act (provided that, if the Purchaser is
selling

 


 

pursuant to the effective registration statement registering the
Securities for resale,
the Purchaser agrees to only sell
such Securities during such time that such registration
statement is effective and not withdrawn or suspended, and only
as permitted by such registration
statement), (ii) such Securities are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144, or (iii) such Securities are eligible for sale under
Rule 144, without the requirement for the Company to be in
compliance with the current public information required under Rule

restrictions.  Certificates (or book entry notations) for
Securities subject to legend removal hereunder may be transmitted
by the Transfer Agent to the Purchasers by crediting the DTC
account of the Purchaser’s broker or other DTC participant as
directed by such Purchaser.

(d) Irrevocable Transfer Agent
Instructions .  The Company shall issue the
Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions to its transfer agent, and
any subsequent transfer agent, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Company represents and warrants that no instruction
other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to
in this Section 4.1(d) (or instructions that are consistent
therewith) is required to be given by the Company to its transfer
agent in connection with this Agreement other than with respect to
the issuance of the Underlying Shares upon a valid conversion of
the Preferred Stock, and that the Securities shall otherwise be
freely transferable on the books and records of the Company as and
to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and applicable law.  The Company acknowledges
that a breach by it of its obligations under this Section
4.1(d) will cause irreparable harm to a
Purchaser.  Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that
the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this
Section 4.1(d) will be inadequate and agrees, in the event
of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions
of this Section 4.1(d) , that a Purchaser shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies, to an order and/or
injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate issuance
and transfer, without the necessity of showing economic loss and
without any bond or other security being required.
 

(e) Acknowledgement
.  Each Purchaser hereunder acknowledges its primary
responsibilities under the Securities Act and accordingly will not
sell or otherwise transfer the Securities or any interest therein
without complying with the requirements of the Securities
Act.  While the Registration Statement remains effective,
any Securities sold by Purchaser will be sold in accordance with
the plan of distribution contained in the Registration Statement
and in compliance therewith and with the related prospectus
delivery requirements unless an exemption therefrom is
available.  Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly
with the other Purchasers, agrees that if it is notified by the
Company in writing at any time that the Registration Statement
registering the resale of the Securities is not effective or that
the prospectus included in such Registration Statement no longer
complies with the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act,
the Purchaser will refrain from selling such Securities until such
time as the Purchaser is notified by the Company that such
Registration Statement is effective or such prospectus is compliant
with Section 10 of the Securities Act, unless such Purchaser is
able to, and does, sell such Securities pursuant to an available
exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act.  Both the Company and its Transfer Agent,
and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, may
rely on this Section 4.1(e) and each Purchaser hereunder
will indemnify and hold harmless each of such persons from any
breaches or violations of this Section 4.1(e) .

to sell the Securities under Rule 144, until the Purchaser no
longer holds any of the Securities, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to timely file (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace
period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the
date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act. During such period, if
the Company is not required to file reports pursuant to the
Exchange Act and if requested by the Purchasers, it will prepare

accordance with Rule 144(c) such information as is required for the

Affiliate of the Company shall, sell, offer for sale or solicit
offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as
defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that will be integrated
with the offer or sale of the Shares in a manner that would require
the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Shares
to the Purchasers, or that will be integrated with the offer or
sale of the Shares for purposes of the rules and regulations of any
trading market such that it would require stockholder approval
prior to the closing of such other transaction unless stockholder
approval is obtained before the closing of such subsequent
transaction.

Publicity .  The Company shall not publicly
disclose the name of any Purchaser or an Affiliate of any

trading market, without the prior written consent of such Purchaser
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  The Purchasers

maintain the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in
connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms
of this transaction).

made or enforced by the Company or, with the consent of the

plan or arrangement in effect or hereafter adopted by the Company,
or that any Purchaser could be deemed to trigger the provisions of
any such plan or arrangement, in either case solely by

 


 

virtue of receiving Shares under the
Transaction Documents or under any other written agreement between
the Company and the Purchasers.

4.6 Non-Public

written consent of such Purchaser, unless prior thereto such
Purchaser shall have executed a written agreement regarding the
confidentiality and use of such information. The Company
understands and confirms that each Purchaser shall be relying on
the foregoing covenant in effecting transactions in securities of
the Company.  Except with respect to any Purchaser who is

director  or observer on the Company’s Board of
Directors, the Company confirms that, following the filing of the
Current Report on Form 8-K as contemplated by Section 4.4 of this

(b) the redemption of any Common Stock, (c) the
settlement of any outstanding litigation or (d) in violation of the
FCPA or OFAC regulations.

 4.8
Indemnification of
Purchasers .  Subject to the provisions of this
Section 4.8 , the Company will indemnify and hold each
Purchaser and its directors, officers, shareholders, members,
managers, partners, employees, investment advisers and agents (and
any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person
holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any
other title), each Person who controls such Purchaser (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and
Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers,
shareholders, agents, members, managers, partners, employees,
investment advisors (and any other Persons with a functionally
equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a
lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling persons
(each, a “ Purchaser Party ”) harmless
from any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims,
contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all
judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation that any such
Purchaser Party may suffer or incur as a result of or relating to
(a) any material breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in this
Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents or (b) any
action instituted against a Purchaser Party in any capacity, or any
of them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the
Company who is not an Affiliate of such Purchaser Party, with
respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents (unless such action is based upon a breach of such
Purchaser’s representations, warranties or covenants under
the Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings such
Purchaser may have with any such stockholder or any violations by
the Purchaser of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by
such Purchaser which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful
misconduct or malfeasance). Promptly after receipt by any
Purchaser Party (the “ Indemnified

 


 

Person ”) of notice of any demand, claim or
circumstances which would or might give rise to a claim or the
commencement of any action, Proceeding or investigation in respect
of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section
4.8 , such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Company
in writing and the Company shall assume the defense thereof,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Person, and shall assume the payment of all fees and
expenses; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified
Person so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Company is
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. In
any such Proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to
retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless: (i) the
Company and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to
the retention of such counsel; (ii) the Company shall have failed
promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person in such
Proceeding; or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such
Indemnified Person, representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them. The Company shall not be liable for any
settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, the Company shall not effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any
Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.
