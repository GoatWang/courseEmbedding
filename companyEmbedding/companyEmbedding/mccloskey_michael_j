Michael J. McCloskey
Co-Founder and CEO, Select Milk Producers
General Manager and Partner, Fair Oaks Dairy Farms
Member, Rework America









	Mike McCloskey is Co-Founder and CEO of Select Milk Producers, the sixth largest milk cooperative in the country. He is also Chairman of the Board for Fair Oaks Farms, a highly rated and visited agritourism destination in Northwest Indiana which also brands and processes its own bottled milk, gourmet cheese and ice cream. McCloskey’s home dairy is Fair Oaks Dairy Farms, also in Northwest Indiana, which milks 15,000 cows living in free-stall barns and is recognized as being the leading dairy in the U.S. from many perspectives. Fair Oaks Dairy Farms harvest their cow manure and through digesters create more than enough electricity to power all of their farms as well as creating bio-based CNG to fuel 42 milk trucks and thus removing 70 million diesel miles annually.

	McCloskey founded and serves as the acting Chairman of Southwest Cheese Company, a joint venture between Glanbia Foods, Dairy Farmers of America and Select Milk Producers. In 2005, Southwest Cheese Company opened as $230 million cheese plant located in Clovis, New Mexico. It employs 260 people, receives 10 million pounds of milk per day and annually produces 250 million pounds of cheese. It is the largest cheddar cheese plant in the world.

	Another strategic initiative McCloskey leads is to create proprietary value-added dairy products. In this regard, McCloskey had been instrumental in the invention of patented milk processing & dispensing systems owned by Select and its affiliate, Fair Oaks Farms Brands. Products such as Mootopia, a high protein, low sugar, lactose free milk that is sold by Texas-based HEB and Select’s privately owned Core Power, a specially formulated athletic drink are among Fair Oaks Farms Brands notable achievements. Currently, Fair Oaks Farms Brands is providing a low-sugar, flavored milk to the renowned Elsie Whitlow Stokes Charter School in Washington, D.C. Through the use of its patented concentrating and dispensing machines, Fair Oaks Farms Brands is helping Elsie Whitlow, as well as the United States Armed Forces, deliver a healthier product while significantly lowering the carbon footprint of milk distribution.

	McCloskey was awarded his Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine in 1976 from the University of Mexico, after which he completed a two-year post-doctoral study in Dairy Production Medicine at the University of California, School of Veterinary Medicine, in Davis, California. McCloskey is a Board Member and Officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, Chairman of the Sustainability Initiative of the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy, and is the recipient of the Alumni Achievement Award from the University of California School of Veterinary Medicine.

Michael J. McCloskey - Bion Environmental Technologies





































































Proven Comprehensive Treatment and Resource Recovery for Livestock Waste
cleaner farms…cleaner water…cleaner air…better economics


































Michael J. McCloskey

 March 01, 2015
 Bion



Michael J. McCloskey, who became a consultant to Bion and its Projects Group during 2005 with respect to its Integrated Projects initiatives and the entire dairy business, obtained his Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine in 1976 from the University of Mexico, Mexico City and completed a specialty in dairy production medicine from the University of California, Davis, which he attended from 1978-80. He is the co-owner/manager of Fair Oaks Dairy Farm, a 15,000 head dairy farm in Fair Oaks, Indiana and is actively involved in the ownership and management of dairies in other states.
In 1992, Dr. McCloskey formed a milk marketing business called Quality Milk Sales. As the coowner/manager of Quality Milk Sales, he is responsible for marketing the milk produced by the dairy farmer members of Select Milk Producers and Continental Dairy Products, who jointly produce in excess of 4 billion pounds of milk per year. These cooperatives stretch through New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. Dr. McCloskey was 3 instrumental in the formation of the Southwest Agency, an agency that controls the marketing and transportation of virtually all milk marketed in Texas and New Mexico. The success of the Southwest Agency is now being viewed as the model for achieving price stability without government intervention in other regions of the country. Dr. McCloskey successfully brought together a joint venture between Glanbia Foods, Select Milk Producers, and Dairy Farmers of America to establish Southwest Cheese Company (‘SWC’).
Dr. McCloskey serves on the board of National Milk Producers Federation and participates in the Federal Order Policy and Dairy Export Policy committees. Dr. McCloskey has had the opportunity to be in a leadership position in every aspect of the dairy industry: from individual cow production to processing, from marketing to federal order reform, and from regional political issues to national issues and international trade.

The goals are to gain insight into normal mental representations and processes and how these are instantiated in the brain, as well as to advance our understanding of cognitive deficits and how they may be treated. For example, my colleagues and I have uncovered a new form of reading impairment, in which visual awareness for letters and digits is selectively disrupted. In this deficit visual perception is normal except that the individual sees letters and/or digits only as blurs or jumbles of lines. We have identified two cases: RFS, a 61-year-old man with a progressive neurological disease, and MTS, a 12-year-old girl who suffered a stroke at age 10. In studying these individuals we are using behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional neuroimaging methods to address questions concerning the cognitive and neural representations underlying visual awareness and reading. We are also exploring, with considerable success, remediations for the reading impairments. In addition to cognitive neuropsychological research, I explore visual-spatial cognition and lexical processing through empirical studies of normal individuals, computational modeling, and functional neuroimaging. Finally, I am interested in foundational issues in cognitive science, including the rationale for adopting a representational/computational conception of the mind, the relationship between cognitive science and neuroscience, the fundamental distinctions between connectionist and symbolic frameworks, and the role of simulation in cognitive science (e.g., McCloskey, 1991).
