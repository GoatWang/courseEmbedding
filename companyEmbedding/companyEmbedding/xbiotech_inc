XBiotech from Red Pepper Group on Vimeo.
                    


                    XBiotech is a fully integrated global biosciences company dedicated to pioneering the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic antibodies based on its True Human™ proprietary technology.
                

                    Unlike previous generations of antibody therapies, XBiotech’s True Human™ antibodies are 100 percent human, derived from individuals who possess natural immunity to certain diseases. With discovery and clinical programs across multiple disease areas, XBiotech’s True Human™ antibodies have the potential to harness the body’s natural immunity to fight disease with increased safety, efficacy and tolerability.
                

                    XBiotech is currently advancing a robust pipeline of antibody therapies to exceed the standards of care in oncology, inflammatory conditions and infectious diseases. The Company's broad pipeline of True Human™ antibodies are able to potentially deliver unmatched safety and efficacy because they are cloned directly from individual donors who possess natural immunity against certain targeted diseases. As such, True Human™ antibodies retain their natural physiology and tolerance profile, having passed the rigors of immune selection in the body. 
                

                    MABp1 specifically targets and neutralizes interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 α), a molecule known to promote angiogenesis, growth and spread of tumors, as well as mediate symptoms such as metabolic dysregulation, fatigue and anxiety associated with advanced cancer.
                

                    Our Philosophy
                

                    The Hippocratic notion that medicine "should never do harm" is a cornerstone to how we approach drug development. This includes the belief that cutting-edge medicine should work in a targeted way to make patients feel better, not worse. We believe this principle should continue to shape the future of medicine.

                    XBiotech has concluded a Phase II pilot study to test MABp1 in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The study was headed by world-leading diabetes expert Dr. Marc Donath, Head of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. Remarkable findings in this study have provided the basis to advance clinical programs in Type 2 diabetes.
                




Type 2 Diabetes Overview

                    Type 2 Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing and most significant disease burdens among industrialized societies. New treatment options are needed to prevent progression of disease and loss of pancreatic function in Type 2 diabetic patients.
                
System Inflammation

                    Inflammatory cells infiltrate white adipose tissue and the pancreas, resulting in the development of insulin resistance and loss of insulin production, respectively. When inflammation makes adipose cells insensitive to insulin, they can no longer take up sugar, making control of blood sugar levels difficult.
                
Pancreatitis (Acute Inflammation of the Pancreas)

                    The pancreas can initially compensate for reduced insulin sensitivity by increasing output of insulin. However, this increased load results in stress on the pancreas and an inflammatory process can ensue in the pancreas itself. Current drugs, such as linagliptin, worsen this process by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin and furthering stress on the pancreas.
                
XBiotech Antibody Therapy

                    The mechanism of action of XBiotech's antibody therapy — to reduce inflammation that compromises pancreas function and glycemic control — could enhance glycemic control by improving the overall status of the systemic inflammatory condition present in Type 2 diabetics. This represents a breakthrough in management of the disease.

                    XBiotech’s proprietary True Human™ antibody discovery platform involves the screening of thousands of human blood donations to identify the chemically relevant antibody using XBiotech’s Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM™) technology. After an antibody and the gene responsible for producing that antibody are identified, the gene is then copied for production in a unique and scalable mammalian expression system that involves the use of simple bioreactor technology.
                

                    The use of this simple disposable bioreactor technology to replace massively complex plant and equipment infrastructure, currently used in antibody therapeutics, is unique to XBiotech. This technology allows XBiotech to produce antibodies at a commercial-scale at a fraction of the cost, with shorter lead-time and greater production flexibility than typically required. 
                

                    XBiotech hosted the Grand Opening of its new Commercial Manufacturing Facility on Thursday, September 15th, 2016 at the building’s location in Austin, Texas. The event included a ribbon-cutting ceremony, tours of the facility as well as talks by XBiotech Senior Management. 
                

                    The nearly 40,000 square foot facility is on XBiotech’s own 48-acre location just 15 minutes from the Texas capital in Austin. The building will provide a significant increase in the company’s manufacturing and quality operations in anticipation of commercialization of the Company’s product pipeline. The new facility will increase about ten-fold the Company’s current production capacity. Completion of this building is the first phase in the Company’s plan to develop the 48-acre property to house additional production facilities, laboratories and administrative operations, creating a headquarter campus as the center of its global operations.

UPDATE: Health-care ETFs on pace for best weekly gain in months
Popular funds used to invest in the health-care and biotech sectors on Thursday were on track for the best weekly advance in seven months, according to FactSet data. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  was up 1.8% on the day and looking at a 10% weekly advance, which would mark its best such gain since the week ended Nov. 11 when the ETF surged 14.4%. The entire health-care complex was on the rise, with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  also on track for its best weekly gain, up 4.2%, since November, with a 1.5% daily climb in sight. Gains in the IBB were being aided by a 13% rise in shares of  XBiotech Inc.  and a 8% jump in Sangamo Therapeutics Inc. [: SGMO]. The moves come as the U.S. Senate offered a glimpse of a draft of a health-care bill and as President Donald Trump has talked about making changes to drug pricing. Health-care stocks, led by Gilead Sciences  were the best performer in the S&P 500 index . The  S&P 500 was trading up 5 points, or 0.2%, at 2,440, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 0.1% at 21,435. The Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, where biotech is a big component, was trading 0.3% higher at 6,253.

XBiotech's stock plunges after IDMC recommends ending late-stage trial of colorectal cancer treatment
XBiotech Inc.'s stock  plunged 62% toward a record low in afternoon trade Friday, after the company said an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) recommended the discontinuation of a Phase-3 trial for the company's colorectal cancer treatment because it failed to meet threshold requirements for continuation. The stock was halted for trading for news until 3:30 p.m. ET. The IDMC said it had no safety concerns, but the findings were not sufficient to meet efficacy endpoints. "We are obviously disappointed with these findings. In the coming weeks, the company plans to analyze the data extensively to further understand the primary and secondary endpoint data, as well as to identify populations that may have benefited from the therapy," said XBiotech Chief Executive John Simard. "These findings today will not affect our efforts to pursue approval of the therapy based on the successful completion of the European study, which demonstrated control of debilitating symptoms in colorectal cancer." The stock has tumbled 64% year to date, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climkbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.

UPDATE: Health-care ETFs on pace for best weekly gain in months
Popular funds used to invest in the health-care and biotech sectors on Thursday were on track for the best weekly advance in seven months, according to FactSet data. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  was up 1.8% on the day and looking at a 10% weekly advance, which would mark its best such gain since the week ended Nov. 11 when the ETF surged 14.4%. The entire health-care complex was on the rise, with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  also on track for its best weekly gain, up 4.2%, since November, with a 1.5% daily climb in sight. Gains in the IBB were being aided by a 13% rise in shares of  XBiotech Inc.  and a 8% jump in Sangamo Therapeutics Inc. [: SGMO]. The moves come as the U.S. Senate offered a glimpse of a draft of a health-care bill and as President Donald Trump has talked about making changes to drug pricing. Health-care stocks, led by Gilead Sciences  were the best performer in the S&P 500 index . The  S&P 500 was trading up 5 points, or 0.2%, at 2,440, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 0.1% at 21,435. The Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, where biotech is a big component, was trading 0.3% higher at 6,253.

XBiotech's stock plunges after IDMC recommends ending late-stage trial of colorectal cancer treatment
XBiotech Inc.'s stock  plunged 62% toward a record low in afternoon trade Friday, after the company said an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) recommended the discontinuation of a Phase-3 trial for the company's colorectal cancer treatment because it failed to meet threshold requirements for continuation. The stock was halted for trading for news until 3:30 p.m. ET. The IDMC said it had no safety concerns, but the findings were not sufficient to meet efficacy endpoints. "We are obviously disappointed with these findings. In the coming weeks, the company plans to analyze the data extensively to further understand the primary and secondary endpoint data, as well as to identify populations that may have benefited from the therapy," said XBiotech Chief Executive John Simard. "These findings today will not affect our efforts to pursue approval of the therapy based on the successful completion of the European study, which demonstrated control of debilitating symptoms in colorectal cancer." The stock has tumbled 64% year to date, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climkbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.
