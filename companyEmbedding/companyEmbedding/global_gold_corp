Operations in Armenia
Toukhmanuk   |   Marjan   |   Getik

Armenia, rich in mineral resources, has a long history in mining going back 5,000 years.  The Soviets explored and mined in Armenia for many years; however, it wasn't until 1995 that the country began to attract foreign investment in an open bidding process for the rights to mine 33 deposits.  By 1996, minerals and mineral products were primary export commodities.  Today, several foreign companies including Chronimet, Dundee Precious Metals, and Lydian International are invested or operating in Armenia.
In many respects, Armenia is unique.  It has strong relations with both the U.S.A and Russia and is a member of more than 40 international organizations including the WTO.  An excellent legislative and treaty framework presents an attractive environment.

Corporate Profile
Global Gold Corporation (Global Gold) is an international gold mining and exploration company that acquires and develops properties with a low cost of production and substantial upside.  We currently operate three properties in Armenia and are the largest gold exploration license holder in the country.  At every level, we are committed to best practices, building shareholder value, and maintaining social and environmental responsibilities in the communities where we work.
Our mission is to establish ourselves as a mid-tier gold producer by maximizing potential of our properties and bringing them into production as soon as possible and in increasing scale.  We recognize that the new global market environment and robust gold price present us with a unique opportunity to build shareholder value.
Global Gold’s strategy is to generate revenues and value through production, development and exploration.  We may also seek to form operating partnerships to bring assets into production more quickly and generate cash flow.  Our focus is on a few key high growth assets with balanced country risk.
Global Gold has a portfolio of gold and silver projects at early and advanced stages of exploration and development in Armenia and has operated in Chile since 2001 
We have one mine in the early stage of production in Armenia
We have two promising exploration properties in Armenia:

100% interest in the Marjan property located in southwestern Armenia.  Marjan is currently in the advanced stage of exploration of a gold and silver deposit.  Historic GKZ reserve data estimate the deposit contains 15.4 million tonnes of ore at average grades of 2.31g/t of gold and 92.1g/t of silver.  A special Mining License was awarded to Global Gold in 2008 for a period of 25 years on the 19. 6 sq km property.
100% interest in the Getik property which is a gold and silver deposit in northeastern Armenia.  The exploration license area covers 27 sq km.

Based in Rye, NY, Global Gold has offices in Yerevan, Armenia, and in Santiago, Chile.  Our management’s b knowledge of the local markets and our on site presence enable us to hire and retain the best local technical talent and give us first mover advantage in identifying and securing prospective properties. 
Global Gold, incorporated in 1980, is a public company traded on the OTCBB in the US under the symbol GBGD.

Operations in Chile
Chile, renowned for its mining industry, is the third largest producer of gold in Latin America. The country is politically stable and has a prosperous free market economy. As an investment grade country with a pro-mining legal climate, Chile represents the model country for foreign investment in exploration, development, and mining. Global Gold's Vice President maintains an office in Santiago, Chile. Previously Global Gold explored and developed the Santa Candelaria and Vadivia properties, which it sold in 2011. Global Gold is currently evaluating potential properties in Chile.

Corporate Profile
Global Gold Corporation (Global Gold) is an international gold mining and exploration company that acquires and develops properties with a low cost of production and substantial upside.  We currently operate three properties in Armenia and are the largest gold exploration license holder in the country.  At every level, we are committed to best practices, building shareholder value, and maintaining social and environmental responsibilities in the communities where we work.
Our mission is to establish ourselves as a mid-tier gold producer by maximizing potential of our properties and bringing them into production as soon as possible and in increasing scale.  We recognize that the new global market environment and robust gold price present us with a unique opportunity to build shareholder value.
Global Gold’s strategy is to generate revenues and value through production, development and exploration.  We may also seek to form operating partnerships to bring assets into production more quickly and generate cash flow.  Our focus is on a few key high growth assets with balanced country risk.
Global Gold has a portfolio of gold and silver projects at early and advanced stages of exploration and development in Armenia and has operated in Chile since 2001 
We have one mine in the early stage of production in Armenia
We have two promising exploration properties in Armenia:

100% interest in the Marjan property located in southwestern Armenia.  Marjan is currently in the advanced stage of exploration of a gold and silver deposit.  Historic GKZ reserve data estimate the deposit contains 15.4 million tonnes of ore at average grades of 2.31g/t of gold and 92.1g/t of silver.  A special Mining License was awarded to Global Gold in 2008 for a period of 25 years on the 19. 6 sq km property.
100% interest in the Getik property which is a gold and silver deposit in northeastern Armenia.  The exploration license area covers 27 sq km.

Based in Rye, NY, Global Gold has offices in Yerevan, Armenia, and in Santiago, Chile.  Our management’s b knowledge of the local markets and our on site presence enable us to hire and retain the best local technical talent and give us first mover advantage in identifying and securing prospective properties. 
Global Gold, incorporated in 1980, is a public company traded on the OTCBB in the US under the symbol GBGD.  As of August 31 2014, we have 87,882,975 shares outstanding and approximately 1,300 shareholders.  Our largest shareholders include Ian Hague (Tusheti Holdings, LLC) and Firebird Management.

TransGlobal Gold Corp.1HomeThe Opportunity/ProjectThe Managment TeamNewsContact UsPhoto GalleryCompany ReferencesWebsite Designed at Homestead Create a Website and List Your BusinessTransGlobal Gold Corp. OpportunitiesWhy Guyana?Guyana is a prolific gold producing country located on the northeast coast of South America, bordered by Brazil to the south and Venezuela to the west. Guyana is a treasure trove of natural resources including Gold, Bauxite and Diamonds. It is recognized as a politically stable country with a legal system based on British Common Law. Guyana gained independence from Great Britain in 1966 and is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Guyana has excellent relations with the United States and benefits from many trade and security agreements.In 2012, Guyana produces an estimated 378,840 oz. of gold (declared) and over 200,000 carats of diamonds (declared), up 23% from 2011. In 2013, Guyana produced approximately 450,000 oz of gold and roughly 50,000 metric carats of diamonds.Gold production may be exported after it has been registered with the Guyana Gold Board and a 5% royalty has been paid. The majority of gold in Guyana is recovered by placer operations, utilizing land plants and river dredging barges.Gold alone accounts for over 50% of Guyana's export revenues. Consequently, Guyana actively cooperates with reputable miners to facilitate responsible mining operations. Over the past two years TransGlobal has developed strong working relationships with Guyana government leaders and personnel.​.TransGlobal Gold Corp. ProjectsWeb Site Disclaimer LanguageThis Web Site exists for informational purposes only and is not intended to be, and does not constitute, an offer to sell, or a recommendation to buy, securities.The Company is a majority-owned subsidiary of Ensurge, Inc., a publicly-held company traded on the OTCBB. This Web Site includes forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current expectations about its future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. The Company has tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words and phrases such as "may", "will", "expects", "anticipates", "believes", "intends", "estimates", "should", "typical", "we are confident" or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Company and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities in the remainder of 2013 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.The Company has limited financial resources, is in the preliminary stage of development, and is currently working towards production in the third quarter of 2013. Though the Company has collected some samples and accumulated some data relating to anticipated gold and diamond content and values, the Company has not conducted a systematic or scientific study of its targeted locations. The Company makes a preliminary determination of prospective values and then proceeds with deploying resources into “production” rather than “testing.” In pursuing this operational course, “production” will represent both the “testing” and the “results.” The Company does not currently intend to carry on its books any asset values for ‘reserves.”Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors of Parent - The United States Securities and Exchange Commission limits disclosure for U.S. reporting purposes to mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce.

U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in the periodic filings of the Company’s parent. You can review and obtain copies of these filings from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtmlProjects Under Development: TransGlobal Gold Corp is planning to continue mining operations in 2015 on its wholly controlled Guyana Mining Claim in the Higgins Landing area on the Mazaruni River. The property is 2,542 acres. This operation has produce both gold and trace diamonds. This area has been a prolific producer of both gold and diamonds.Testing has been undertaken on the property with the use of a small washplant and hand tools. This method  allows us to gain reasonable projection of average depth to bedrock and average gold per yard. The testing stage is complete and we  are ready to begin full scale operations.TransGlobal Gold Corp. will purchase the necessary equipment, build a base camp, establish a landing point for the loading and unloading of supplies, and setting up the land based gold and diamond processing plant. The company is in the process of transporting existing equipment belonging to Ensurge, Inc from Olive Creek to Higgins Landing by river.TransGlobal Gold Corp. is currently developing the mine site by clearing the vegetation and stripping the valueless overburden with an excavator and dozer. After removing these top layers the paying gravels will be exposed then  processed into the wash plant where the gravels will be separated from the gold. The gold will be collected once a week from the wash plant and the gold will be crudely smelted onsite into unrefined gold Dore´ bars for sale to the Guyana Gold Board.The Diamonds will be collected in diamond collecting machines called jigs. The diamonds will be sold to authorized and licensed dealers in Guyana.The Company will follow all laws and regulations concerning mine operations and the marketing of precious metals and diamonds. Safety rules and regulations will always be adheredEnvironmental Factors: After an area is mined methods of environmental reclamation will be used to restore the environment to its previous state. We will maintain a full staff of workers for reclamation purposes. The government of Guyana provides the seeds to regrow the local plant life.Our goal and purpose is to leave the environment as we found it without any signature that it was mined.Current Mining Operations: TransGlobal Gold Corp has a management agreement on a small operation in the vicinity of Higgins Landing. This operation is currently in production. The operation consists of an excavator and land plant.Future Projects: TransGlobal Gold Corp is in the process of aggressively evaluating new properties and looking to undertake new management contracts.
