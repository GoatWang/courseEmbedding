(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q.  Our Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.  Overview  The Company is a leading provider of employment law compliance solutions for employers and workers in an environment in which shift or other part-time/temporary positions, commonly called "gigs," are performed. In what is now being called the Gig Economy, businesses such as those in our current target market in the restaurant and hospitality industries contract with independent workers for less than full-time engagements primarily in the form of shift work. The trend toward a Gig Economy has begun, and we are endeavoring to participate through an employment related service offering. A study by Intuit predicted that by 2020, 40 percent of American workers would be less than full time independent contractors. Intuit, Inc. October 2010. "Intuit 2020 Report: Twenty Trends That Will Shape the Next Decade."  A significant problem for employers in the Gig Economy involves compliance with regulations imposed by federal, state and local governments, including requirements associated with worker's compensation insurance, and other traditional employment compliance issues, including the employer mandate provisions of the ACA. The compliance challenges are often complicated by the actions of many employers in reducing workers' hours as a means to avoid characterizing employees as "full-time." Congress is considering amendments to or replacement of the ACA. As of the date of this filing, the ACA has not been formally amended or repealed. Employers still face regulatory issues and overhead costs, including those associated with the employer mandate provisions of the ACA for which we believe our services are a cost-effective solution.  Table of Contents  For Gig/Shift Workers, whom we also call "Shifters," the significant problem is difficulty in finding other jobs/gigs to replace hours lost when their employers reduce their hours and make them less than full-time employees or otherwise to fill workweek employment voids.  We believe ShiftPixy has the ideal solution for both of these groups and each of their problems via a service offering that entails two principal elements (that we refer to collectively as our "Ecosystem") as follows:  * ShiftPixy Employer Solution: ShiftPixy absorbs the employer's Shifters as ShiftPixy Employees and makes those employees available to the former employer to work the same jobs, as employees of ShiftPixy, shouldering a substantial portion of the employment-related compliance responsibilities. In addition, when the ShiftPixy mobile app is released, businesses will be able to access via that technology additional qualified workers, who are already part of the ShiftPixy Ecosystem, to fill workforce voids on short notice, having assurance that such employees have work experience, will be paid, will be covered by applicable workers' compensation coverage, will have applicable employment related taxes calculated and processed.  * ShiftPixy Shifter Solution: Shifters placed with one of ShiftPixy's clients can now access other shift work with other ShiftPixy clients, ultimately through the new ShiftPixy mobile app, a prototype of which was released in September 2016. When released to the general public, anticipated to be in the fourth quarter of 2017, the ShiftPixy mobile app will enable not only ShiftPixy shift employees but also ultimately shift employees outside the ShiftPixy Ecosystem, many of them millennials who connect to the outside world solely through mobile devices, to access available shift jobs at all of ShiftPixy's participating clients. In addition to the benefits of working not as independent contractors but as employees, enjoying the protections of workers' compensation coverage and employment laws, as well as the calculation and remittance of applicable employment taxes, among other benefits, Shifters are also enabled to participate in ShiftPixy's benefit plan offerings, including minimum essential health insurance coverage plans and a 401(k) plan.  ShiftPixy's headquarters is currently situated in Irvine, California, from which it can reach the Southern California market, and has a modest staff in Phoenix, but it plans to open the following additional physical offices over the course of the next several years, potentially in the following order:  * First, New York and then Orlando;  * Next, after the above offices are operational, and upon securing additional financing, if necessary, we plan to proceed to Dallas and then Chicago;  * Finally, after all the above offices are operational, and upon securing additional financing, if necessary, we plan to proceed to Las Vegas and then Atlanta.  Through these office locations, we plan to engage more actively with clients through sales, marketing, employee onboarding, training and payroll processing, in each instance as necessary and appropriate to the applicable market.  These markets collectively account for or allow us to cover approximately 53% of our target market in the restaurant/hospitality sectors. (U.S. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. May 2015. Occupational Employment and Wages.)  Table of Contents  ShiftPixy and its subsidiary collectively serve, as of May 31, 2017, an aggregate of approximately 92 clients with an aggregate of approximately 2,899 active, paid worksite employees, as well as providing only payroll administration services to an additional 23 clients with 1,132 employees. None of these clients represents more than 10% of our annualized revenues for the three or nine months periods ending May 31, 2017.  ShiftPixy's anticipated business and revenue growth will result from the following factors:  * Large Potential Market.  * The burdens placed on employers with over 50 full-time employees under the ACA.  * Marketing Advantages from Strategic Insurance Provider Relationships.  * New ShiftPixy Mobile App that is designed to provide Additional Benefits to Employers and Shift Workers.  * Ultimate Development of a ShiftPixy Ecosystem.  * Mitigation of Employment Law Compliance Risks.  The Problem: Employment law compliance requirements present a multi-obstacle ridden employment related compliance landscape for our target market of businesses that rely significantly on part-time and temporary workers. Challenges facing such businesses include the need to secure applicable workers' compensation insurance coverage, to effect employment related tax withholdings and filings, and to navigate laws related to hiring and release of employees, including discrimination (race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and sexual orientation), sexual harassment, sick pay and time off, hours of work, minimum wage and overtime, gender pay differentials, immigration, safety, child labor, military leave, garnishment and other wage imposition processing, family and medical leave, COBRA, and unemployment claims. ACA compliance currently adds another significant burden to businesses with more than 50 full-time workers, as they try to manage the additional burdens associated with mandated health insurance benefits.  A business can secure assistance in mitigating and even eliminating these challenges by retaining ShiftPixy.  The ShiftPixy Solution: ShiftPixy is developing an Ecosystem comprised of a closed proprietary operating and processing system that helps restaurant or hospitality businesses (and in the future, businesses in additional industries wherein we plan to market our services) as well as shift workers by matching available shifts with available shift workers. The ShiftPixy Ecosystem provides the following benefits:  * Compliance  * Cost Containment  * Cost Savings  Shift Human Capital Management Inc.: We formed Shift Human Capital Management Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, in December 2015. We formed this subsidiary in response to the need to have worker's compensation policies written in the names of the clients (as may be required by some states) and otherwise in response to client needs for only administrative and processing services rather than the full-service, staffing program offered by ShiftPixy. As of May 31, 2017, ShiftableHR had 91 clients (included in our total aggregate of 115 clients) with 1,770 worksite employees and 1,132 employees for whom we provide only payroll administration services. Our goal is to migrate these clients to ShiftPixy.  Table of Contents  Consolidated results of our operations for the three months ended May 31, 2017 vs. three months ended May 31, 2016  The following table summarizes the consolidated results of our operations for the three months ended May 31, 2017, and May 31, 2016 (Unaudited).   For the Three For the Three Months Months Ended Ended May 31, 2017 May 31, 2016 Gross Billings $ 27,456,730 $ 13,324,855 Adjustments to Gross Billings 22,828,368 11,126,254 Net Revenue 4,628,362 2,198,601 Cost of Revenue 3,750,349 1,222,911 Gross Profit 878,013 975,690 Operating Expenses 3,587,685 925,934 Net (Loss) Income $ (2,709,672 ) $ 49,756 Net (Loss) Available to Common Shareholders per Common Share: Basic $ (0.10 ) $ 0.00 * Diluted $ (0.10 ) $ 0.00 * Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Used in Per Share Computations: Basic 26,555,706 26,653,731 Diluted 27,381,931 26,653,731 _________  * Denotes net income of less than $0.01 per share.  Table of Contents  Three-month period ended May 31, 2017  Gross Billings. ShiftPixy provides contingent staffing and workforce management solutions, principally to businesses that make significant use of part-time employees; we are currently focusing on the restaurant and hospitality industries. The company currently targets clients in Southern California but plans to expand our geographic coverage. Our gross billings are primarily based on (i) the payroll cost of our worksite employees; (ii) the employer portion of payroll-related taxes; (iii) employee benefit programs; (iv) workers' compensation insurance coverage and (v) admin fees and delivery fees, which are the fees charged to clients for providing payroll processing and temporary staffing services. Gross billings for the three months ending May 31, 2017, were earned from billings to clients to whom we provide staff or workforce management support. Our mobile workforce management solution remains under continuing development. Gross billings for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017, versus the first three months of 2016 totaled $27.5M compared to $13.3M. As a result, gross billings increased by $14.1M or 106%. The primary driver for the increase in gross billings was a result of the Company adding approximately 70 new clients and approximately 1,200 new worksite employees over the previous twelve months.  Net Revenues. Net revenues exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings. With respect to employer payroll taxes, employee benefit programs, workers' compensation insurance, we believe that we are the primary obligor, have latitude in establishing price, selecting suppliers, and determining the service specifications and, as such, the gross billings for those components are included as net revenues. Net revenues are recognized ratably over the payroll period as worksite employees perform their service at the client worksite. Net revenue for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017, were earned from gross billings to clients to whom we provide staff or workforce management support less pass-through costs related to payroll, taxes, and benefits. Our mobile workforce management solution remains under continuing development. Net revenue for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017 versus the first three months of 2016 totaled $4.6M compared to $2.2M. As a result, net revenue increased by $2.4M or 111%. The primary driver for the increase in net revenues was a result of the Company adding approximately 70 new clients and approximately 1,200 new worksite employees over the previous twelve months.  Cost of Revenues. Our costs include the costs of employer side taxes, worker's compensation insurance coverage. Cost of revenues for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017 versus the first three months of 2016 totaled $3.8M compared to $1.2M. As a result, cost of revenues increased by $2.5M or 207%. While the Company does expect to achieve certain economies of scale as it grows, it is expected that the cost of revenues will continue to increase proportionately to the increase in gross billings and net revenues.  Gross Profit. Gross profit for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017, versus the first three months of 2016 totaled $878K compared to $976K. As a result, gross profit decreased by $98K. The primary cause for the decline in gross profit resulted from incremental investments in workers compensation coverages as the Company prepares for the on-boarding of new clients post-IPO.  Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017, versus the first three months of 2016 totaled $3.6M compared to $926K. As a result, total operating expenses increased by $2.7M or 288%. The primary causes for the increase in operating expenses during the period were due to the addition of 20 new corporate employees to support the growth in new clients totaling $872K, incremental investments of $378K in professional fees required to support the Company's IPO, further investments of $658K in software development costs for the Company's new mobile application, and $760K in marketing, advertising, and general and administrative expenses.  Net income/Net loss. As a result of the explanations and investments described above, the net loss for the three-month period ending May 31, 2017, was $2.7M, compared to a $50K net profit for the three-month period ending May 31, 2016.  Table of Contents  Consolidated results of our operations for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 vs. nine months ended May 31, 2016  The following table summarizes the consolidated results of our operations for the nine months ended May 31, 2017, and May 31, 2016 (Unaudited).

The primary driver for the increase in gross billings was a result of the Company adding approximately 70 new clients and approximately 1,200 new employees over the previous twelve months.  Table of Contents  Cost of Revenues. Our costs include the costs of employer side taxes, worker's compensation insurance coverage. Cost of revenues for the nine-month period ending May 31, 2017 versus the first nine months of 2016 totaled $10.9M compared to $1.4M. As a result, cost of revenues increased by $9.6M or 679%. While the Company does expect to achieve certain economies of scale as it grows, it is expected that the cost of revenues will continue to gross proportionately to the increase in gross billings and net revenues.  Gross Profit. Gross profit for the nine-month period ending May 31, 2017, versus the first nine months of 2016 totaled $4.8M compared to $1.2M. As a result, gross profit increased by $3.6M or 307%. The primary cause for the increase in gross profit resulted from the addition of new clients and worksite employees that increased gross billings and net revenues.  Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the nine-month period ending May 31, 2017, versus the first nine months of 2016 totaled $7.2M compared to $1.3M. As a result, total operating expenses increased by $5.9M or 448%. The primary causes for the increase in operating expenses during the period were due to the addition of 20 new corporate employees to support the growth in new clients totaling $2.7M, incremental investments of $623K in professional fees required to support the Company's IPO, further investments of $658K in software development costs for the Company's new mobile application, and $1M in marketing, advertising, and general and administrative expenses.  Net loss. As a result of the explanations and investments described above, the net loss for the nine-month period ending May 31, 2017, was $2.5M, compared to a $151K net loss for the nine-month period ending May 31, 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company incurred losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations and had limited working capital through May 31, 2017.  Since inception, the Company's principal source of financing has come through the sale of its common stock. The Company successfully completed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on NASDAQ on June 29, 2017, raising a total of $12 million (exclusive of underwriter commissions and certain IPO-related expenses). As a result, the Company believes that, because of its operating results as well as cash received from the IPO, the Company will have sufficient cash to fund operations through at least the next twelve months.  Credit Facilities  We have been offered but have not accepted any credit facilities or other access to bank credit.  Capital Expenditures  We do not have any contractual obligations for ongoing capital expenditures at this time. We do, however, purchase equipment and software necessary to conduct our operations on an as needed basis.  Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies  Except for our software agreement, we do not have any ongoing material contracts that extend beyond a one-year period or which are not cancellable sooner.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Table of Contents  Contingencies  Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's management, in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate, assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company's financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable, but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.

Scott Absher on Pensacola Business Radio

“Shifter workforce” helps employers avoid the burden of ACA compliance; ShiftPixy™ revolutionizes the Gig Economy structure
Irvine CA – June 30, 2016 –ShiftPixy, Inc. is currently offering to help fellow employers use innovative solutions to avoid the many burdens created by the Affordable Care Act. Providing unique insurance products, regulatory compliance services, and proprietary human administration tools, ShiftPixy also lends out their private variable workforces to third party employers that have been forced to reduce the size of their organizations.
“ShiftPixy, not the employer, retains the workforce known as ‘Shifters’. All administrative and regulatory matters that accompany the hiring of Shifters is handled by ShiftPixy, totally removing that burden from its contract employers. Under ShiftPixy’s tutelage, these employers get the benefit of having a workforce without the regulatory burdens that normally accompany the hiring of that workforce. The employer gets to maintain workforce levels while providing Shifters the opportunity to receive ‘full time’ revenues and healthcare coverage,” states Scott Absher, CEO, ShiftPixy, Inc.
“The Affordable Care Act is affecting personnel decisions. A survey of more than 600 small business owners by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 20% of companies surveyed reported they have cut the number of workers they employ. Employers are not required to offer coverage for employees who work less than 30 hours per week. A related study found that 12% of employers’ nationwide are planning to reduce workers’ hours as a result of the ACA. By making the Shifters into ShiftPixy employees, we can now lend them out to the third party employers who are in need of additional workers,” continues Absher.
ShiftPixy has reported filing a Reg A+, the new SEC regulatory vehicle that allows non-accredited investors the opportunity to invest in a Company at an early stage (IPO). Previously, investing in pre-market IPO’s had been available to only a select few accredited or institutional investors.
For more information:

ABOUT SHIFTPIXY, INC.
ShiftPixy, Inc. was created to take advantage of weaknesses in compulsory insurance markets where statutory requirements for business owners collide with the extremely limited access to the coverage and compliance they are required to have.
www.shiftpixy.com
ShiftPixy management is in the optimal position to intermediate a more effective solution to meet the needs on both the provider and shift worker sides of this new labor reality in the U.S. ShiftPixy has developed proprietary technology and client engagement processes that enable the Company to create high value on both sides of the U.S. shift work chasm.
ShiftPixy allows available and qualified shift workers to connect with immediately available shifts from participating ShiftPixy providers through a simple mobile application. Shift workers or “Shifters” can find shift opportunities within their skill set and geographic range, and pick unfilled shifts when they need the work.
ShiftPixy processes the entire workflow on the provider side from offering open shifts, approving a Shifter based on their rich profile, to processing the entire payroll, insurance and regulatory demands for each shift hour worked.

HELPING EMPLOYERS
In helping employers take care of their employees, we could see changes and decisions for employers that were resulting in fewer hours for shift workers but leaving gaps or holes in employers’ schedules.
SHIFTPIXY’S SOLUTION

ShiftPixy was designed to sync work opportunities from job providers with the open time slots of available shift workers.
ShiftPixy manages relationships with job providers to take open shift opportunities that are filling their schedules and offer them as work opportunities to qualified workers without the formal job interview and commitments.
The ShiftPixy app allows shift workers to enroll, profile and prequalify based on their work and training experience for open shift opportunities.  “Shifters” can earn provider specific qualifications to boost their score and access to more shift opportunities.

SHIFTPIXY ADVANTAGE
ShiftPixy has built a very robust platform that processes and manages over 50 essential and regulated aspects of the job provider’s human capital management demands.

("ShiftPixy® or the "Company") a disruptive Next Gen GIG Economy provider of unique insurance products, regulatory compliance services, proprietary human administration tools and variable labor force provider, announced the initial roll-out of its business model in Southern California.  Building upon this success, the Company plans to release a new application in early September 2016, that will enable unemployed, under-employed or part-time and/or full-time individuals in the nation's restaurant and hospitality industry workforce, and ultimately in all business' workforce, to apply for variable shift work from businesses in their local market. Appropriately, this proprietary app is planned for release on Labor Day 2016.

The Company saw that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), while solving problems also inadvertently opened up a whole new market for labor services… and the Company also saw that the shortcomings in the much hyped new class of the service industry, the "GIG Economy," was not the way to tap into this vast new market.
The GIG Economy is a service industry where workers are expected to operate like mini-businesses. The influence of these kinds of service industry companies is growing. According to an analysis by Greylock Partners, the value of transactions over platforms such as car services Lyft and Uber, grocery delivery service Instacart and courier service Postmates could grow as large as $10 billion this year."
Scott W. Absher, ShiftPixy Founder & CEO said: "As technology has advanced over the past decade, new internet-based employment platforms emerged which are often referred to collectively as the 'Gig Economy'." Many of these platforms, such as Uber (transportation) and Instacart (grocery delivery) regularly engage 'contract workers' rather than 'employees' for jobs (gigs). Among other reasons, this classification allows companies like Uber to operate with 20% to 30% less in labor costs than the competition,leading to eye-popping numbers like Uber's $40 billion valuation or Instacart's latest $220 million round of funding. Many fear the loss of the gig workforce structure, either by a wave of class-action lawsuits, intervention by regulators, or through the collective action of disgruntled workers, and the gig economy may be in serious jeopardy.

ShiftPixy's evolution of the classic GIG model, totally eliminates this key weakness in the standard model of treating workers as independent contractors.
ShiftPixy has embraced the next Gen structure for the GIG economy by making their workers (ShiftPixy calls them "Shifters") employees of ShiftPixy and lending them out to third party employers in need of additional workers.
The employers get the benefit of having a workforce without the compliance and regulatory burdens that normally accompany their hiring of a regular workforce, particularly ones that exist in industries with many part-time/shift workers such as the restaurant and hospitality industries, ShiftPixy's initial target market. ShiftPixy and NOT the operating business is the entity that employs these Shifters and handles ACA and other administrative and regulatory compliance matters that accompany the hiring of employees. ShiftPixy totally removes that burden from its operating business clients.
The need for the services the Company offers is an unintended result of and has been amplified by the compliance burdens placed upon employers of GIG Economy workers under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). ShiftPixy recognized this need early on and saw it as an opportunity.
As shown by the studies below, the ACA's new compulsory insurance requirements for US business owners has caused companies to reduce the number of hours worked by employees as their default solution.  However, that left them with a need for additional workers to fill the void.
As a result, employers require a greater number of employees who are each working fewer hours than before… and shift workers now need more opportunities to work for different companies in order to maintain their income level.
Absher added: "The Affordable Care Act is affecting personnel decisions. A survey of more than 600 small business owners by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 20% of companies surveyed reported they have cut the number of workers they employ. Employers are not required to offer coverage for employees who work less than 30 hours per week. A related study found that 12% of employers nationwide plan to reduce workers' hours as a result of ACA[1]."

One direct casualty of ACA has been the shift worker, with full time employment with one employer becoming a thing of the past as employers dropped hours and shifts to bring their business into ACA compliance by having less than 50 full time employees.  Full time employees not only include traditional full time workers working more than 30 hours per week but also requires employers to make complex calculations involving all part time workers to make sure they don't have part time workers constituting equivalent full time employees.
"There are approximately 26 million part time workers in the United State," said Absher.. "Of these, more than 6 million people are classified as 'involuntary part-time workers', meaning that they would have preferred full-time employment, but were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job[2].

On the other side of the table, due to ACA, in order not to be subject to ACA insurance mandates job providers now had to have more people working fewer hours. The Company has seen that race to meet the new demands and covering new gaps are stressing small business as never before in the US. The new demands have made delivery and cash flows challenging for small employers who provide most of the US employment.
Scott W. Absher, Co-Founder & CEO added: "We have seen that the race to meet the new demands and covering new regulatory requirement gaps are stressing small business as never before. The new demands have made compliance, staffing, and cash flows more challenging for small employers who provide most of the US employment. To address these widespread pain points, ShiftPixy has established a unique and what we believe are a highly desirable suite of services that merge insurance coverage access, operational, compliance and financial support, along with intermediation of shift workers and available shifts at participating businesses."
One valuable aspect of ShiftPixy's services to employers is access to a large pool of qualified shift workers that are part of the Company's proprietary ecosystem. Many of these shifters will come into the ecosystem through their current employers who become ShiftPixy clients thus making ShiftPixy the employer of record for their workers. The Company intends to add to the ShiftPixy ecosystem others seeking employment (but not working for ShiftPixy employers) from Company marketing initiatives focused on continuously expanding the pool of available shift workers, initially from the new mobile app the Company will offer in September 2016. These activities will give employers a greater incentive to become ShiftPixy clients by making available to them a greater number of qualified, local shift workers to fill available shifts through marketing to potential shifters outside the ecosystem will occur simultaneously with onboarding additional shifters via new employer enrollment with ShiftPixy.
ShiftPixy will initially target the restaurant and hotel industries, a market comprised of 13 million workers. Management has also identified several additional markets such as New York, Chicago, Dallas and Orlando where ShiftPixy may in the future target for marketing through what it will promote as bringing the same high value type services to these industries as it is now bringing to the restaurant and hospitality industries.
ShiftPixy is already generating significant revenue, and has the realistic potential to achieve what few startups can in a short period of time - generate significant annual revenues.
Asher added: "Management has leveraged its expertise and long standing market alliances within the property and casualty producer community to assemble a large backlog of potential Provider Clients for what we believe to be the Company's unique platform and programs. ShiftPixy now is in the position of being able to select rather than inviting Provider Clients into its proprietary program which we believe will enable ShiftPixy to grow more rapidly and select clients that may add more profitably to our operations."
Absher added: "We call a prospective employee a 'Shifter'. We have designed our ShiftPixy mobile app to be the primary entrance into the ShiftPixy ecosystem for a Shifter who was not an employee of an company that became a ShiftPixy client. The user experience on this app is being designed to provide a simple mobile access and opportunity management tool for Shifters to select and manage their shift opportunities. ShiftPixy intends to collect nominal monthly user fees from Shifter participation in the ShiftPixy ecosystem via this app. The ShiftPixy app will also serve as a gateway for Shifters to access perks and benefits an employee of a large company would enjoy. These perks may include health dental and vision coverages, 401(k) or IRA access, and a variety of discounts."
Media expenditures are planned to support the launch of the mobile Shifter access application. Additionally, the Company's electronic marketing plan focuses on generating message buzz around the ACA enforcement actions we expect in 2016 will show up in the form of penalties in 2016 for the unprepared employers of 2015. These penalties are steep, potentially in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more and we expect will gain a great deal of national attention. When this happens, the Company intends to produce a significant volume of publicity around the ShiftPixy compliance solution within the trade and financial media to attempt to attract additional clients.
ShiftPixy's planned B2B digital message program will track hot subject matter surrounding ACA enforcement and compliance and produce additional content we will use to elevate ShiftPixy as an innovative employer solution to these ACA problems
The Company also reported that it has filed with the SEC an Offering Circular on Form 1-A under new Regulation A+. This new SEC regulation allows not only just wealthy accredited or institutional investors but also non-accredited investors… everyday people… the opportunity to invest in A+ IPO's.  For more information go to: https://wrhambrecht.com/ipos/shiftpixy-inc-regulation-a-ipo/
About ShiftPixy, Inc.   
ShiftPixy was formed to take advantage of weaknesses in compulsory insurance markets and new compliance requirements for U.S. businesses where statutory requirements for business owners collide with extremely limited access to the required insurance coverage, particularly health care insurance coverage, and related regulatory compliance issues. ShiftPixy management has leveraged over 20 years of experience in developing and marketing alternative risk programs to address unique business insurance needs into the delivery of a unique and what we believe to be a highly desirable suite of services to merge coverage access with operational compliance and financial support.
ShiftPixy's management team discovered that recent new demands due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were forcing a new compliance layer into the marketplace for our existing and potential Provider Clients which we were forced to aid in addressing for them. Due to the compliance and risk areas of expertise that were core to our client delivery, mastery of an effective solution such as the one we have developed has become essential.
In the work to master and incorporate a means to effectively address the new ACA compliance
demands as part of our core service platform we observed that shift work was now very vulnerable. The direct casualty of ACA was the shift worker who is now seeing full time employment with one employer becoming a thing of the past as small employers dropped hours and shifts to bring their business into ACA compliance. The shift worker has now become part of the under-employed and forgotten millions in the US economy.
One the other side of the ACA impact were the job providers who now had to have more people
working fewer hours. The race to meet the new demands and covering new gaps are stressing small business as never before in the US. The new demands have made delivery and cash flows challenging for small employers who provide most of the US employment. 
ShiftPixy management realized that they were in the prefect position to intermediate a better
solution to meet the needs on both the provider and shift worker sides of the new Next Gen labor reality in the US. ShiftPixy has developed proprietary technology and client engagement processes that enable the Company create high value on both the employer and the employee sides of the U.S. shift work chasm.
When launched in September, the ShiftPixy mobile app allows available and qualified shift workers to connect with immediately available shifts from participating ShiftPixy Provider Clients through a simple mobile application. Shift workers or "Shifters" can find shift opportunities within their skill set and geographic range and pick up available shifts when they need the work. ShiftPixy processes the entire workflow on the provider side from offering open shifts, approving a Shifter based on their rich profile, to processing all of the payroll, insurance and regulatory demands for each shift hour worked.
The ShiftPixy provider platform secures and monetizes long-term Provider Client relationships under annual agreements which are not passive or transactional but active and vital to our client's success. Our product suite is designed to meet critical operational and financial needs and are specifically focused to exploit what we see as the current market weakness, with our goal of placing our value proposition very high with the Provider Clients we target. The ShiftPixy Shifter platform secures and monetizes individuals seeking shift work based on need and availability matched to their specific skills and within their geographic range on a monthly fee basis for access.
ShiftPixy management has leveraged not only its expertise but also its long-standing market alliances within the property and casualty producer community to assemble a very large backlog of Provider Clients anxious for the planned launch of our unique platform and programs. The Company has the unique position of allowing rather than inviting Provider Clients into its proprietary program which allows ShiftPixy to grow rapidly and select Provider Clients profitably.
Our goal for our small business Provider Client business owners is to liberate them to do what they do best, provide high quality service to their customers. Our dedication and mastery of the "dailies" for our Provider Clients and ability to guide through small course corrections keep our Provider Clients on a path free of surprises or risks from failure to attend to and cure small issues before they take root and grow to expensive obstacles to the growth of the business. The resultant freedom our Provider Clients find now allows them to dedicate their focus to the growth of their business. These are truly liberating tools for small business owners on many significant business and personal levels.
ShiftPixy's primary Client Provider service engagement is contractual and allows Client Providers coverage access, operational and processing bandwidth from which we extract regular residual fee income monthly. Management is developing other high value touch points designed to strengthen and further monetize these Provider client engagements. Shifter user engagements will be monetized by charging for the services but keep the charges at low levels intended to drive mobile app utilization and community growth through not only shift access and opportunity management but personal access to perks an employee of a large corporation might enjoy due to the ShiftPixy economy of scale.
