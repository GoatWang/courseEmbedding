	Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements


	(Unaudited)


	 


	 


	1)    Nature of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	Nature of Organization and Basis of Presentation






	WestMountain Distressed Debt, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Colorado on October 18, 2007 and on this date approved its business plan and commenced operations.


	 


	The Company is presently planning to develop and implement a web site based operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities beyond what it can generate through our network of contacts. The Company also plans to utilize the most current technology to analyze investments and believes the technology will assist in the analysis of each opportunity.


	 


	Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements





	We have prepared our unaudited interim condensed financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to these rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. In our opinion, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position as of June 30, 2016, the interim results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim statements have not been audited. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from our audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K. The unaudited interim condensed financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements, including the notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The unaudited condensed financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods disclosed in this report are not necessarily indicative of future financial results.


	 




	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements

	Going Concern





	The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  The Company has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $488,371 as of June 30, 2016, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.  The Company had stock listing fees of $10,000 due to OTC Markets on March 1, 2016 which have not yet been paid.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.


	 






	The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, commence operations, provide competitive services, and ultimately to attain profitability.

	 




	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements


	 



	On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This standard will be effective for the Company for the year ending on December 31, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2014-15.






	(2) Income Taxes





	The Company incurred net operating losses during all periods presented resulting in a deferred tax asset, which was fully allowed for; therefore, the net benefit and expense resulted in $-0- income taxes.





	(3)    Related Parties





	We entered into an agreement with SP Business Solutions ("SP") to provide accounting and related services for the Company. The owner, Joni Troska, was appointed Secretary of WestMountain Distressed Debt, Inc. on October 15, 2009, and is considered to be a related party. Total expenses incurred for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 with SP were $500 and $500, respectively. Total expenses incurred for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 with SP were $1,000 and $1,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 an accrual of $1,000 has been recorded for unpaid services.





	On October 17, 2014, we entered into a Promissory Note Agreement with WestMountain Company, a related party, in the amount of $25,000. The note bears an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan was due on or before April 16, 2015. On April 18, 2015, we entered into a new Promissory Note Agreement for the total principal and interest due on the original note as of April 18, 2015. The new principal amount is $27,256. The new note carries an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan was due on or before October 18, 2015. On October 18, 2015 we entered into a new Promissory Note Agreement for the total principal and interest due on the extension as of October 18, 2015. The new principal amount is $29,729. The new note carries an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan is due on or before April 18, 2016. This note is currently in default. The default interest rate is 24% which has been applied to calculate accrued interest beginning on the maturity date of the note. As of June 30, 2016, the total principal and interest due on this note is $33,482.

	ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION







	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry, management beliefs, and certain assumptions made by our management.  Words such as "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates", variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements.  Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  However, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth herein and in other reports and documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.


	 


	General


	 


	Our original plan was to earn income by holding distressed real estate properties for resale at a future date when market conditions are more favorable. We have decided to expand our business plan to include the potential acquisition of all forms of distressed debt, including real estate mortgages, securities such as promissory notes, and assets acquired through bankruptcy. We will screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with long term potential. We have no prior history of operating as a firm in the distressed debt business.





	We also continue to develop a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments.  This screening process will be refined as a result of the expanded nature of our business plan. This process will be based upon the experience of our management team and outside consultants.  This process has not been fully developed at this time.


	 


	 We plan to act as a holder of all forms of distressed debt by raising, investing and managing private equity and direct investment funds for third parties including high net worth individuals and institutions. As is the industry practice, we plan to earn management fees based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income based on the performance of these funds. We do not plan to focus on any particular industry but will look at any and all opportunities.





	We are presently planning to develop and implement a web site based operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities beyond what we can generate through our network of contacts. We also plan to utilize the most current technology to analyze investments. We believe the technology will assist in the analysis of each opportunity.





	Our principal executive offices are located at 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525, and our telephone number is (970) 223-4499.  However, in the future, we plan to occupy separate office facilities and obtain office furniture and equipment, depending on the development of our business plan. If we are not successful in our operations we will be faced with several options:       









	 1.  




	Cease operations and go out of business;






	2.  




	Continue to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital;






	3.  




	Bring in additional capital that may result in a change of control; or






	4.  




	Identify a candidate for acquisition that seeks access to the public marketplace and its financing sources








	We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

	Results of Operations


	 





	The following discussion involves our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.






	We have not generated operating revenues since our inception.


	 


	Operating expenses consist primarily of selling, general and administrative costs. Most of the costs were attributable to professional and contract services. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, operating expenses were $8,185 and $24,311, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, operating expenses were $17,661 and $36,569, respectively. In 2015 the Company paid additional professional fees to become DTC eligible. For the same period of time, the Company paid additional audit fees.  We do not anticipate these professional fees or contract services to increase significantly in the future. However we believe that our selling, general and administrative costs will increase as we grow our business activities going forward.






	For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $11,827 and $26,923 respectively. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $24,810 compared to a net loss of $41,080 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss over the periods presented are directly related to the change in operating expenses.





	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	Our cash on June 30, 2016 was $4,610.  





	Cash flows used in operating activities were $7,648 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to cash flows used in operating activities of $43,875 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The change over the periods presented are related to the decrease in net loss, an increase in accounts payable and accrued interest on the related party notes payable.





	Net cash used in investing activities was $-0- for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.


	 


	Cash flows provided by financing activities were $-0- and $37,256 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015. The change over the periods presented are related to proceeds that the Company received from related parties for the six months ended June 30, 2015. In 2016, no proceeds have been received for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 





	Over the next twelve months we do not expect any material capital costs in our operations.





	Because most of our costs are fixed in amount and are recurring in nature we expect our quarterly operating expenses to remain consistent throughout 2016.


	 



	We expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues. We expect approximately $40,000 to $60,000 in operating costs for the current year. We plan to generate revenues in the next twelve months from making investments and receiving fees for the placement of capital. Since there can be no assurances that we will generate any revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future, it will be necessary to raise additional funds. We believe at this time that raising additional funds may be difficult, if not impossible.





	We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business.

	On October 17, 2014, we entered into a Promissory Note Agreement with WestMountain Company, a related party, in the amount of $25,000. The note bears an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan was due on or before April 16, 2015. On April 18, 2015, we entered into a new Promissory Note Agreement for the total principal and interest due on the original note as of April 18, 2015. The new principal amount is $27,256. The new note carries an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan was due on or before October 18, 2015. On October 18, 2015 we entered into a new Promissory Note Agreement for the total principal and interest due on the extension as of October 18, 2015. The new principal amount is $29,729. The new note carries an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan is due on or before April 18, 2016. This note is currently in default.

	On November 4, 2015 we entered into a new Promissory Note Agreement for the total principal and interest due on the original note as of November 4, 2015. The new principal amount is $10,912. The new note carried an interest rate of 18% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan is due on or before May 5, 2016.

	This note is currently in default. The default interest rate is 24% which has been applied to calculate accrued interest beginning on the maturity date of the note.

	As of June 30, 2016, principal and interest due on this note is $12,299.

	As of December 31, 2015, principal and interest due on this note is $25,616. On January 1, 2016, we entered into a new Promissory Note Agreement for the total principal and interest due on the original note as of December 31, 2015. The new principal amount is $25,616. The new note carried an interest rate of 6% per annum until paid in full. Repayment of the loan is due on or before May 1, 2016.

	This note is currently in default. The default interest rate remains at 6%.

	As of June 30, 2016, principal and interest due on this note is $26,382.






	We are negotiating terms for an extension of all notes which are in default.


	 


	Plan of Operation for January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016





	We plan to act as a holder of distressed real estate properties by raising, investing and managing private equity and direct investment funds for third parties including high net worth individuals and institutions. As is the industry practice, we earn management fees based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income based on the performance of these funds. We do not focus on any particular industry in the real estate market but will look at any and all opportunities.





	We are presently planning to develop and implement a web site based operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities beyond what we can generate through our network of contacts. We also plan to utilize the most current technology to analyze investments. We believe the technology will assist in the analysis of each opportunity.



	 



	 


	 



	- 12 -







	 


	 



	 



	Additionally, we have decided to pursue finding an acquisition candidate as either an alternative or an adjunct to our present business plan. To date, we have had discussions with potential candidates but have not concluded any definitive arrangements and may never do so. However, for the remainder of the fiscal year, we plan to both actively pursue our business plan and to look for an acquisition candidate.





	If we are not successful in our business plan or in finding an acquisition candidate, we will be faced with several options:









	 1.  




	  Cease operations and go out of business;






	 2.  




	  Continue to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital; or






	 3.  




	  Bring in additional capital that may result in a change of control; or






	 4.  




	  Identify a candidate for acquisition that seeks access to the public marketplace and its financing sources.








	We operate out of one office in Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.  


	 


	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements with any party.










	ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.





	None.


	 


	 


	 



	- 13 -

















	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES


	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	 




	 



	As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a -15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act), our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.





	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting


	 


	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.





	This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.










	PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION







	ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS





	There are no legal proceedings, to which we are a party, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.











	ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS


	 


	You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below; and all of the other information included in this document. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results and could negatively impact the value of your investment.


	 



	The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely

	 

	affect our business, financial condition and operating result. In this case,

	 

	the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or

	 

	part of your investment.



	 


	We are in default on all of our debt and have an outstanding payable to the OTC Market.





	At the present time, we are in default on all of our debt, which is in the amount of $104,151 as of June 30, 2016. In addition, we have a payable outstanding in the amount of $10,000 to the OTC Market for continued listing of our common stock. We are actively negotiating an extension of our debt and searching for additional funding to continue our operations and to liquidate. If we are unable to renegotiate our debt and ultimately pay off our debt and payables, we may be forced to cease operations. If we are unable to pay for our continued listing on the OTC Market, we may lose our stock listing. At the present time, we cannot guarantee that we will either be able to renegotiate our debt or pay any of our payables, including the payable for our continued OTC Market listing.





	We have no substantial operating history, and have never been profitable.  As a result, we may never become profitable, and, as a result, we could go out of business.





	We were formed as a Colorado business entity in October, 2007.  At the present time, we have never been profitable. There can be no guarantee that we will ever be profitable.  Even if we develop revenue, there is no assurance that we will become a profitable company. We may never become profitable, and, as a result, we could go out of business.





	Because we had incurred a loss and have limited operations, our accountants have expressed doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.





	For our audit as of December 31, 2015, our accountants have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of a limited history of operations, limited assets, and operating losses since inception. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:





	 






	·  




	our ability to find suitable investments; and











	·  




	our ability to generate substantial revenues.








	Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues. 

	We expect approximately $40,000 to $60,000 in operating costs over the next twelve months.

	We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient revenues will cause us to go out of business.




	 



	- 14 -














	Our lack of substantial operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance. An investor could lose his entire investment.


	 



	We have a limited operating history. An investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate us as an investment. An investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in our ever becoming profitable.





	If we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations, our business may fail.





	We have not generated revenues since our inception. As of June 30, 2016, we had a cash position of $4,610. We are in default on all of our debt, which is in the amount of $104,151 as of June 30, 2016. In addition, we have a payable outstanding in the amount of $10,000 to the OTC Market for continued listing of our common stock. We anticipate that operating costs will be approximately $60,000 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. These operating costs include insurance, taxes, office lease, maintenance, contract services and all other costs of operations. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated. However, the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. We plan to generate revenues in the next twelve months from making investments and receiving fees for the placement of capital. Since there can be no assurances that we will generate any revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future, it will be necessary to raise additional funds. We believe at this time that raising additional funds may be difficult, if not impossible.





	Competition in the investment industry is intense.


	 


	Our business plan involves acting as an acquirer of real estate assets that are being sold at a discount to the original purchase price. This business is highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies providing such services in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully market our services in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully.





	The share control position of WestMountain Red, LLC will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions.


	 



	 


	            

	Our largest shareholder, WestMountain Red, LLC

	,

	of which Mr. Klemsz is a 16.8% member, owns 1,610,000 shares and thereby controls approximately 81% of our outstanding shares. Because WestMountain Red, LLC individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares, other shareholders, individually or as a group, will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors, the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company, even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders generally.


	 


	Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our President and our Treasurer and the continued financing of WestMountain Red, LLC.


	 


	We depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Klemsz, our President and Treasurer. Mr. Klemsz is our primary executive officer, and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations. In addition, WestMountain Red, LLC, is our only source of financing. We do not have an employment contract with Mr. Klemsz, and we do not carry key person insurance on his life. The loss of the services of Mr. Klemsz through incapacity or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business. It would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as Mr. Klemsz and a financing source to replace WestMountain Red, LLC.





	Our revenue and profitability fluctuate, particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in our business, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our shares.





	We may experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year and among years if we are paid incentive income from certain funds only when investments are realized, rather than periodically on the basis of increases in the funds' net asset values. The timing and receipt of incentive income generated by our funds is event driven and thus highly variable, which contributes to the volatility of our revenue, and our ability to realize incentive income from our funds, may be limited. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, it may have a significant impact on our revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. In addition, our investments would be adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter, resulting in revenue attributable to our principal investments, even though we receive no cash distributions from our funds, which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings.

	.


	 


	 


	 



	- 15 -














	Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our funds and reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, which could materially reduce our revenue and results of operations.










	If economic conditions are unfavorable our funds may not perform well and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new funds. Our funds are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. The global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control, including rising interest rates or inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a market downturn, our businesses could be affected in different ways. Our funds may face reduced opportunities to sell and realize value from their existing investments, and a lack of suitable investments for the funds to make. In addition, adverse market or economic conditions as well as a slowdown of activities in a particular sector in which portfolio companies of these funds operate could have an adverse effect on the earnings of those portfolio companies, and therefore, our earnings.





	A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing:



	 








	§


	the net asset value of the assets under management to decrease, lowering management fees;













	§


	lower investment returns, reducing incentive income;













	§


	material reductions in the value of our fund investments in portfolio companies which reduce our ''surplus'' and, therefore, our ability to realize incentive income from these investments; and













	§


	investor redemptions, resulting in lower fees.





	 






	Furthermore, while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain distressed asset investments, such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds with debt investments.


	 


	The success of our business depends, in large part, upon the proper selection of investments, which may be difficult to find, acquire and develop.


	 


	We believe that the identification, acquisition and development of appropriate investments are key drivers of our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain these investments under favorable terms and conditions and have them increase in value. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our attempts to find, acquire, and/or develop appropriate investments will not be challenged by competitors, which may put us at a disadvantage. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior programs or investments, which may imperil our profitability.


	 


	Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock


	 


	The lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities.


	 


	We have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers. Thus, no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock. The lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities, as well as your ability to dispose of, or to obtain accurate information about, and/or quotations as to the price of, our securities.





	We have limited experience as a public company.





	We have only operated as a public company since December, 2009. We have been listed to trade under the trading symbol WMDS since January, 2010. Thus, we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.


	 






	 


	 



	- 16 -














	We may be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisors Act, which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.


	 



	Because our business involves the acquisition of real estate assets that are being sold at a discount to the original purchase price, we may be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law. While we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law, either the SEC or state regulators, or both, may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future. As a result, there could be an increased regulatory burden on us which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.





	We may be impacted by new regulatory requirements as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.





	In July, 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, which instituted major changes in the regulatory regime for public companies, particularly those in the financial sector. At the present time, we do not believe that we will be impacted in a material way by this legislation. However, the implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to regulations which have not yet been written and its statutory provisions have not been the subject of extensive judicial review, so we cannot guarantee that we may not come under its purview at some point in the future and be affected negatively by it.


	 


	Our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee an active trading market will ever develop for our securities.


	 


	There has been, and continues to be, a limited public market for our common stock. An active trading market for our shares has not, and may never develop or be sustained. If you purchase shares of common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:











	·


	changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;













	·


	changes in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;













	·


	announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations,  acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;













	·


	introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop;













	·


	departures of key personnel.





	 


	Of our total outstanding shares as of June 30, 2016, a total of 1,840,000, or approximately 92.78%, is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.



	 


	 

	    

	As restrictions on the resale end, the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.





	Applicable SEC rules governing the trading of "Penny Stocks" limit the liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.


	 


	Our common stock currently trades from time to time and always below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock is considered a "penny stock" and is subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded.  These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks.  Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchaser's agreement to a transaction prior to purchase.  These regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock.



	 


	 



	- 17 -














	The over-the-counter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations.



	 



	The securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods. These broad market fluctuations and other factors, such as new product developments and trends in the our industry and in the investment markets generally, as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.





	Buying low-priced penny stocks is very risky and speculative.





	Our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000, exclusive of principal residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets.


	 


	Issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, if a public trading market develops.


	 


	We have the authority to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. Although no financing is planned currently, we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution. In addition, we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval.


	 


	The issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. An issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our board of directors' authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.





	Colorado law and our Articles of Incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits, which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit.


	 


	Colorado law provides that our director will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as a director. Our Articles of Incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our director caused by his negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our director and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.


	  


	We do not expect to pay dividends on common stock.





	We have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Earnings, if any, that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion.

WestMountain
Distressed Debt, Inc.

(A
Development Stage Company) 

Notes to the
Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

 

1)    Nature
of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

 

Nature of
Organization and Basis of Presentation

WestMountain
Distressed Debt, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Colorado on
October 18, 2007 and on this date approved its business plan and
commenced operations.

 

The Company is
a development stage enterprise in accordance with ASC 915 -
“Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage
Enterprises”.  The Company’s plan is to act
as an acquirer of real estate assets that are being sold at a
discount to the original purchase price.

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business.  As shown in the accompanying financial
statements, the Company is a development stage company with no
history of operations, limited assets, and has incurred operating
losses since inception.  These factors, among others,
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern.

 

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.  The Company’s continuation as a
going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional
operating capital, commence operations, provide competitive
services, and ultimately to attain profitability.

 

Use of
Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

The Company
considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of
three months or less when acquired to be cash
equivalents.  As of September 30, 2010 and December 31,
2009 there were no cash equivalents.

 

(2)  
Certificates of Deposit

 

The company has
made it a policy to invest funds over and above its forecasted
operating expenses in certificates of deposit.  The terms
on the certificates have ranged from three to six
months.  

 

(3)   
Stockholders Equity

 

On November 19,
2007, the Company sold 290,000 shares of its common stock for $290
or $0.001 per share.

 

On November 20,
2007, the Company sold 235,000 shares of its common stock for
$2,350 or $0.01 per share.

 

On November 28,
2007, the Company sold 8,050,000 shares of its common stock to
WestMountain Red, LLC, an affiliate, for a cash price of $320,000
or $0.04 per share.  The stock transaction made
WestMountain Red, LLC the Company’s majority
shareholder.

WestMountain
Distressed Debt, Inc.

(A
Development Stage Company)

Notes to the
Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

 

On November 30,
2007, the Company sold 465,750 shares of its common stock for
$46,575 or $0.10 per share.  The stock sale was made in
reliance on an exemption from registration of a trade in the United
States under Rule 504 and/or Section 4(6) of the Act.  The
Company relied upon exemptions from registration believed by it to
be available under federal and state securities laws in connection
with the offering.

 

A total of
9,040,750 shares were issued for a total cash price of
$369,215.  All of the shares issued are considered to be
“restricted stock” as defined in Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933.  As of June 30, 2009,
the common stock issued and outstanding at par is $9,041 or $0.001
per share.  The amount over and above the $0.001 par
value per share is recorded in the additional paid-in capital
account in the amount of $360,174.

 

 There
were no changes in common stock and additional paid in capital for
the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

 

4)   
Related Parties

 

Bohemian
Companies, LLC and BOCO Investments, LLC are two companies under
common control.  Mr. Klemsz, our President, has been the
Chief Investment Officer of BOCO Investments, LLC since March
2007.  Since there is common control between the two
companies and a relationship with our Company President, we are
considering all transactions with Bohemian Companies, LLC, related
party transactions.

 

On January 1,
2008, we entered into a Service Agreement with Bohemian Companies,
LLC, to provide us with certain defined services. These services
include financial, bookkeeping, accounting, legal and tax matters,
as well as cash management, custody of assets, preparation of
financial documents, including tax returns and checks, and
coordination of professional service providers as may be necessary
to carry out the matters covered by the Service Agreement. We will
compensate Bohemian Companies, LLC by reimbursing this entity
for the allocable portion of the direct and indirect costs of each
employee of Bohemian Companies, LLC that performs services on
our behalf.

 

We will receive
invoices on a monthly basis from Bohemian Companies, LLC. This
Service Agreement was for the term of one year, ending December 31,
2009 but was extended to December 31, 2010. Total expenses incurred
with Bohemian Companies were $3,000 each for the quarters ending
September 30, 2010 and 2009 and $9,000 each for the nine months
ending September 30, 2010 and 2009.  As of September 30,
2010 the Company had no balance due to Bohemian Companies,
LLC.

 

The Company
entered into an agreement with SP Business Solutions
(“SP”) to provide accounting and related services for
the Company.  The owner, Joni Troska, was appointed
Secretary of WestMountain Distressed Debt, Inc on October 15, 2009,
and is considered to be a related party.  As of September
30, 2010 an accrual of $200 has been recorded for unpaid
services.

 

(5)   
Concentration of Credit Risk for Cash

 

The Company has
concentrated its credit risk for cash by maintaining deposits in
financial institutions, which may at times exceed the amounts
covered by insurance provided by the United States Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). As of September 30, 2010 the
Company has no risk for the excess of the deposit liabilities
reported by the financial institution over the amount that would
have been covered by FDIC. The Company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk to cash.

Subsequent Events

 

On October 12,
2010, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our current
Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized Common Stock
from 50,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares and approved of a one

Common Stock.  The increase in authorized common shares
will become effective on the filing of articles of amendment to our
articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of Colorado
which filing will occur at least 20 days after October 25, 2010.
The reverse split will be effective on such date as may be set by
the Board of Directors and approved by the Financial Regulatory
Agency (FINRA), but no earlier than 20 days after October 25,
2010.

ITEM
2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND
PLAN OF OPERATION

 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in
its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.  This item contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may
differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking
statements.

 

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein
by reference contain forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations,
estimates, and projections about our industry, management beliefs,
and certain assumptions made by our management.  Words
such as “anticipates”, “expects”,
“intends”, “plans”, “believes”,
“seeks”, “estimates”, variations of such
words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements.  These statements are not
guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict;
therefore, actual results may differ materially from those
expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking
statements.  Unless required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or
otherwise.  However, readers should carefully review the
risk factors set forth herein and in other reports and documents
that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, particularly Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form
8-K.

 

General

 

     We
earn income by holding distressed real estate properties for resale
at a future date when market conditions are more favorable. We will
screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with
long term potential. Our company has no prior history of operating
in the distressed real estate business.

 

       We
act as a holder of distressed real estate properties by raising,
investing and managing private equity and direct investment funds
for third parties including high net worth individuals and
institutions. As is the industry practice, we earn management fees
based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income
based on the performance of these funds. We do not focus on any
particular industry in the real estate market but will look at any
and all opportunities.

 

       We
are presently planning to develop and implement a web site based
operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities
beyond what we can generate through our network of contacts. We
also plan to utilize the most current technology to analyze
investments. We believe the technology will assist in the analysis
of each opportunity.

 

If we are
not successful in our operations we will be faced with several
options:

 




 1.



Cease
operations and go out of business;





 2.



Continue
to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital;





 3.



Bring in
additional capital that may result in a change of control;
or





 4.



Identify a
candidate for acquisition that seeks access to the public
marketplace and its financing sources




 

Currently,
we believe that we have sufficient capital to implement our
business operations or to sustain them through December 31, 2010.
If we can become profitable, we could operate at our present level
indefinitely. To date, we have not had any discussions with any
possible acquisition candidate nor have we any intention of doing
so.

 

We have
not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar
proceeding. 

 

Results of
Operations

 

The
following discussion involves our results of operations for the
quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

 

We have
not generated revenues from operations since our inception on
October 18, 2007.

 

Operating
expenses, consisting primarily of selling, general and
administrative costs were $9,707 for the quarter ended September
30, 2010, compared to $8,788 for the quarter ended September 30,
2009.  Selling, general and administrative costs were $27,362
for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $28,549
for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.  Most of the
costs were attributable to professional and contract services. We
do not anticipate these professional fees to be as significant
until we begin to grow the business.

 

 

- 9
-

  

 

 

 

We had a
net loss of $9,525 for the quarter ended September 30, 2010,
compared to a net loss of $8,099 for the quarter ended September
30, 2009.  We had a net loss of $26,584 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $25,341 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2009.

 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

Our cash
on September 30, 2010 was $14,142.  We had an
additional amount of $189,867 in Certificates of
Deposit.

 

Over the
next twelve months we do not expect to incur any material capital
costs in our operations.

 

Because
we do not pay salaries, and our major professional fees have been
paid for the year, operating expenses are expected to remain fairly
constant.

 

To try to
operate at a break-even level based upon our current level of
business activity, we believe that we must generate approximately
$50,000 in revenue per year. However, if our forecasts are
inaccurate, we will need to raise additional funds. In the event
that we need additional capital, WestMountain Red, LLC has orally
agreed to loan such funds as may be necessary through December 31,
2010 for working capital purposes.

 

On the
other hand, we may choose to scale back our operations to operate
at break-even with a smaller level of business activity, while
adjusting our overhead to meet the revenue from current operations.
In addition, we expect that we will need to raise additional funds
if we decide to pursue more rapid expansion, the development of new
or enhanced services or products, appropriate responses to
competitive pressures, or the acquisition of complementary
businesses or technologies, or if we must respond to unanticipated
events that require us to make additional investments. We cannot
assure that additional financing will be available when needed on
favorable terms, or at all.

 

We expect
to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be
incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues. We
expect approximately $50,000 in operating costs over the next
twelve months. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to
cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient
revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go
out of business.

 

Plan of
Operation for January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010

 

 We
earn income by holding distressed real estate properties for resale
in a current timeframe or in the future when market conditions are
more favorable. We will screen investments with emphasis towards
finding opportunities with long term potential. Our company has no
prior history of operating as firm in the distressed real estate
business.

 

 We
act as a holder of distressed real estate properties by raising,
investing and managing private equity and direct investment funds
for third parties including high net worth individuals and
institutions. As is the industry practice, we earn management fees
based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income
based on the performance of these funds. We do not focus on any
particular industry in the real estate market but will look at any
and all opportunities.

 

     We
are presently planning to develop and implement a web site based
operation to gather additional potential investment opportunities
beyond what we can generate through our network of contacts. We
also plan to utilize the most current technology to analyze
