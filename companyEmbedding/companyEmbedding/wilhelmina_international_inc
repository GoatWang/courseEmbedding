Will Wilhelmina International Inc (WHLM) Continue To Underperform Its Industry?



Lawrence Carr 


            				July 12, 2017			        


 With a ROE of 0.9%, Wilhelmina International Inc (NASDAQ:WHLM) could hardly match the performance of its industry, which averaged an ROE of 25.98%. However, it is important not to simply take one look at the metric and get caught up on the number alone. A multitude of factors affect the ROE, which is unequivocally the most popular profitability ratio, and digging through them in detail is a must before arriving at any conclusion. Check out our latest analysis for Wilhelmina International 
Breaking down Return on Equity
 ROE is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company. The ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominator.While an ROE ratio of more than 15% would draw any investor’s attention, historically, established companies in the developed countries have delivered an ROE between 10% and 12%.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 For a company to create value for its shareholders, it must generate an ROE higher than the cost of equity. Unlike debt-holders, there is no predefined return for equity investors. However, an expected return to account for market risk can be arrived at using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. For WHLM, it stands at 8.47% versus its ROE of 0.9%.


 Wilhelmina International (NasdaqCM:WHLM) Last Perf Jul 12th 17
 
                         Using Dupont Analysis, we find out that ROE is composed of three ratios: profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. The method reflects the impact of change in key figures in both the income statement and the balance sheet. The analysis provides a bird’s-eye view on the strengths and weaknesses of the company.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 A trend of profit growing faster than revenue is indicative of improvement in ROE. While investors should assess the past correlation between them, an assessment of the analysts’ profit and revenue forecast points to the most likely scenario going forward.Wilhelmina International’s ROA over the past 12 months stood at 1.4% versus the industry’s 7.65%. Although an investor should look at multi-year asset turnover to assess its effect on the latest ROE, a quick comparison with the industry tells him whether it’s acceptable. We use ROA for the comparison as along with sales, used in asset turnover, earnings, used in ROA, are also comparable within the industry.
 

 Wilhelmina International (NasdaqCM:WHLM) Historical Debt Jul 12th 17
 
 We can assess whether WHLM is fuelling ROE by excessively raising debt or if it has a balanced capital structure by looking at the historic debt-equity trend of the company. While Wilhelmina International’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 0.1, investors should assess how it has changed over the past few years. To account for leverage, we should look at WHLM’s Return on capital, which stood at 3% in the past year versus industry’s 11.88%. ROC is earnings as a percentage of overall employed capital compared to just equity as in the case of ROE.
ROE – It’s not just another ratio
 ROE is called the mother of all ratios for a reason. It helps gauge a company’s efficiency both through the income statement and the balance sheet, along with telling you how just changing the capital structure of the company can impact perceived return.
