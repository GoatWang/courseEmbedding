Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016.

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

Sandler Capital Management Acquires Market-Leading Crafts Group from PRIMEDIA | Business Wire


























































Sandler Capital Management Acquires Market-Leading Crafts Group from 
      PRIMEDIA






September 27, 2006 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enthusiast Media LLC, an entity formed by affiliates of Sandler Capital 
      Management, has acquired substantially all of the assets of the Crafts 
      Group from PRIMEDIA, Inc. (NYSE: PRM) for approximately $132 million in 
      cash.
    


      As a leader in specialty publishing within the growing $30 billion 
      crafts marketplace, Enthusiast Media LLC publishes nine leading consumer 
      magazine titles. The strength of the business is reflected in its 
      diverse asset mix including traditional magazine publishing, online and 
      digital media, multiple consumer and trade events, merchandising as well 
      as domestic and international product licensing. All nine consumer 
      magazines are household names led by market leaders, including: Creating 
      Keepsakes in scrapbooking, Paper Crafts in paper crafting and 
      card making, Quilter’s Newsletter and 
      McCall’s Quilting in quilting and Sew 
      News in sewing. The company’s 
      numerous consumer events (marketed under Creating Keepsakes University 
      and Creating Keepsakes Convention brand names) and its Memory 
      Trends trade show are among the premier retail and trade events in 
      the scrapbooking market.
    

“As investors, we are constantly looking for 
      high-quality businesses that can benefit from our industry expertise and 
      financial resources,” explained Michael 
      Marocco, Managing Director and head of private equity for Sandler 
      Capital. “Based on the Crafts Group’s 
      market leadership across scrapbooking, quilting and sewing, we believe 
      Enthusiast Media LLC presents an excellent opportunity for value 
      creation.”


      Marocco further noted that Dave O’Neil, 
      formerly Vice President/Group Publisher for PRIMEDIA Crafts Group, will 
      serve as CEO, while Lisa Bearnson, Founding Editor of Creating 
      Keepsakes magazine and a leading spokesperson for the scrapbooking 
      industry, will serve as Creative Director.
    

      Sandler Capital Managing Director Adi Dehejia added, “We 
      are pleased to partner with Dave O’Neil, Lisa 
      Bearnson and the rest of the Enthusiast Media management team to take 
      the company to the next level of success. We believe there are numerous 
      opportunities to grow these market-leading crafts brands, especially in 
      the digital media and online sectors.”


      O’Neil noted that the vision of Enthusiast 
      Media LLC is to think deeper, not wider. “As 
      the leading information content provider in the craft hobby space, we 
      have a core audience that looks to us to connect them with the latest 
      trends and techniques in their craft niche. The acquisition by Sandler 
      Capital will allow us to be more nimble in creating and responding to 
      market opportunities.”


      Adding to its market leadership, Enthusiast Media also boasts several 
      leading craft celebrities, particularly in scrapbooking and paper 
      crafts. Opportunities to leverage these celebrities in building 
      broadcast programming, new online and on-location events as well as 
      print and digital titles, will simply grow these categories, noted 
      Bearnson.
    

“I'm excited to take a larger, more creative 
      role with this new company,” said Bearnson. “My 
      goal is to build a grassroots company like the one I originally founded (Creating 
      Keepsakes magazine) where we will be highly responsive to the needs 
      of our readers, manufacturers and advertisers. Our team has exciting 
      plans that include taking scrapbooking to a new level in both the 
      digital and tactile worlds."
    

      Enthusiast Media LLC adds to Sandler Capital’s 
      recent investments in the publishing industry, which include Discover 
      Media, HarborPoint Media and Penton Media.

Andrew Sandler began his career as a research analyst at Perry Partners in 1989, after receiving his BS in Finance from the University of Wisconsin.It currently has over $1.2 billion in assets under management. Sandler Capital divides its efforts between a long/short equity strategy and a long/short credit strategy. Specifically, the firm uses a long/short equity approach with a multi-sector focus, seeking to produce returns and appreciation in general in spite of economic shifts and market volatility.

Emerging LeadersTraining can substantially increase the success rate of emerging leaders, and Sandler's Leadership Solutions prepare you to meet the challenges of higher-level responsibilities. You'll gain more engagement and accountability from employees, develop more unified and collaborative teams, and be better prepared to deal with the trials of a leadership role.Emerging Leaders



ExecutivesAs a Senior Executive, you want your emerging leaders and others you're positioning in the succession plans to become fully equipped to move to the next stages and perform successfully.  Training that specifically addresses these transitions can substantially increase the likelihood of their success.Executives



CoachesIn our experience, many organizations underestimate the importance of the coaching role. They misunderstand the definition of coaching, coach inconsistently, or entirely omit coaching from the picture. Through Sandler’s Coaching Program you’ll learn how to identify and unlock the performance code of each individual on your team, and maximize their performance. Coaches






Leadership isn’t the result of any particular management processIts not an extension of the manager's authority as defined by the corporate hierarchy.  It's the manner by which a process is implemented—the attitudinal qualities the manager brings to everyday interactions. 






Successful managers must be able to effectively...Support corporate initiatives through the accomplishment of department goals.Channel their people’s efforts in the appropriate directions in order to accomplish those goals.Acquire specialized knowledge and skills relevant to managing people and helping them accomplish predictable results.



Effective leaders must build on those managerial skills, plus...Have an instinctual understanding about human nature, and why people act the way that they do.Be able to observe their peoples’ behavior, analyze and respond to it in an objective, supportive, and constructive manner.Encourage, enable and recognize their people for their performance.
