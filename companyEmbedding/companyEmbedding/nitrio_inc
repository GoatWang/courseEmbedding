About — Nitrio































































About Us










Nitrio is building the next generation of artificial intelligence technology for sales teams. It was founded by two Stanford PhD researchers, has an experienced and highly motivated team, and is well funded by top-tier venture capital (early investors in Dropbox, Xactly, Uber, and others).Nitrio’s product helps inside sales reps win more with an AI that learns from how your best reps communicate effectively with their customers. Unlike any other sales tool, Nitrio’s Probabilistic Semantic Graph(TM) technology invented by the founders allows us to understand specific topics within conversations and how chains of topics help or hurt deal outcomes. The product uses this understanding to give insight into specifically what reps and managers should do to move conversations toward success and away from failure.Founded by  







Alex MihlinAlex co-founded Nitrio while completing his PhD in Data Science research at Stanford. He holds master's degrees from Stanford and the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. He also spent 6 years in the Israel Defense Forces developing scientific computing applications. 







Corey McCallCorey co-founded Nitrio while completing his PhD in Data Science and  Electronics research at Stanford.
