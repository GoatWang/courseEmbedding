Why Spruce




We pay attention


	At Spruce, our success is directly aligned with yours. Firmly seated on your side of the table, we take a thoughtful, innovative approach to asset protection and growth that incorporates the power of compounding returns, year after year. 

	As a trusted partner with our clients, we deliver:


		Objective, independent advice

		Proprietary risk management

		Access to global investment opportunities

 Professional staff from leading investment banks, hedge funds and private equity firms


	Our first concern is always with shedding unnecessary risk. We look at risk from both a market perspective and a fund or individual security perspective. Based on decades of experience and constantly refined proprietary modeling, we weigh expected returns against anticipated volatilities. We construct and tactically adjust portfolios according to these measurements, consistent with your goals and risk appetite.

	Spruce's diversified portfolios frequently consist of a combination of traditional and alternative asset classes worldwide - a complex and creative construction that we believe will yield attractive results, often with less downside risk.

Daily focus on achieving investor goals

	Agility is vital to our success, so we keep a vigilant eye on the rapid pace of developments in today's domestic and international markets, rebalancing your investments as needed - daily, if necessary - to take advantage of subtle changes in climate.

	Above all, we believe in genuine, open partnership, and work closely with each of our clients to address their concerns and their long-term goals.

Partners in prosperity


	Clients have been drawn to Spruce for a variety of reasons, but chief among them may be our approach to collaboration. We foster true partnerships that surpass the typical client-advisor relationship, focused on the stability and growth of your investments.

	Together, we develop an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) that outlines your objectives and targets strategic asset allocation. Spruce regularly monitors the relevancy of your IPS, rebalancing investments as necessary to take advantage of changes in the climate.  The portfolio goals include traditional and alternative investment opportunities across the globe.

Wealth preservation and growth

	Serving as a trusted investment advisor for high-net-worth investors, family offices, endowments and foundations, our emphasis is on the preservation of individual and multi-generational wealth.

	Whether clients only require investment guidance, access to alternative investments, or need us to serve in the full capacity as an outsourced chief investment officer, the degree to which we are of service depends entirely on your needs. The Spruce servicing model provides clients with access to Spruce client service personnel by phone-email- or in person, includes consolidated reporting, annual presentations and custom research assignments .

Trust and collaboration

	A sophisticated investor with proprietary risk systems, Spruce has client relationships that total approximately $1.3 billion. Unbeholden to a parent company or majority shareholder, we report directly to you. Our interests are firmly aligned with yours, creating a platform of trust and collaboration upon which to build stability, growth and we believe, the opportunity for ongoing attractive investment returns.

Investment approach




Stability with compounding 


	At Spruce, we seek to adhere to three guiding principles - protect capital in down markets, generate competitive returns in up markets and strive to outperform over the full investment cycle. It's this absolute return-focused approach to investment management that we believe differentiates us from other advisors.

	Beginning with you, we first develop an intimate understanding of your goals, such as capital needs, attitudes toward asset preservation and growth, liquidity requirements, risk tolerances, potential tax sensitivities and legacy concerns. Together, we develop a dynamic Investment Policy Statement that clearly outlines your specific investment objectives in keeping with these personal parameters. This statement stakes out the boundaries of your asset class preferences and return expectations.

Globally diversified portfolios

	In conformity with this policy statement, we then construct your portfolio from the most appropriate public and private global market sources. By employing a combination of research-driven modeling, informed capital market assessments and objective experience surrounding the changing nature of risk environments, Spruce determines the impact of each candidate position on your entire portfolio prior to executing a trade. Portfolio adjustments are carefully evaluated from both a macro and technical research perspective.

	A cross-pollination of investment themes often results in diversified portfolios consisting of multiple positions across a dozen or more asset classes, including, but not limited to:

	Traditional Asset Classes


		High-Income Securities

		Currencies and Commodities

		Taxable and Tax-Exempt Fixed Income

		Global Equities


	Alternative Asset Classes


		Fundamental Long/Short Commodities

		Global Long/Short Equities

		Absolute Return Strategies: Event-Driven, Distressed, and Macro/CTA

		Private Real Estate

		Private Natural Resources

		Private Equity and Growth Capital


	Each component of your portfolio is monitored and analyzed to ensure its appropriate contribution to overall risk and return. Significant deviations from expected outcomes form the basis of portfolio adjustments that are made on a timely basis.

Risk managed with passion and vigor

	Our access to alternative asset classes, particularly through emerging fund managers in largely inaccessible markets worldwide, often forms an important non-correlative component of our clients' portfolios. Spruce's due diligence process for manager sourcing involves both internal and third-party analysis.

	Extensive stress testing, risk budgeting and proactive tail risk management across the complete portfolio is designed to lead to reduced drawdowns during difficult markets which, in turn, provides the basis for quicker recoveries and total asset growth during market upturns. Financial assets managed in this way compound at higher average rates of return over time and reach new levels of asset appreciation sooner.

	Primary services

	Spruce provides entirely customized investment solutions for each client based on their objectives. In every case, Spruce deploys a set of primary services in order to deliver optimum performance. Those services are:


		Creation of formal Investment Policy Statement

		Asset allocation, dynamic portfolio construction

		Third-party asset manager sourcing, due diligence and tracking

		Strategic access to established and emerging alternative managers

		Sophisticated portfolio hedges and non-correlated investments

		Risk management including stress testing, tail risk analysis

		Daily drawdown analysis to manage liquid market risk during periods of heightened market volatility

		Portfolio rebalancing

		Consolidated performance reporting

STAMFORD, Conn., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Spruce Investment Advisors, the outsourced Chief Investment Officer for U.S.-based individuals, family offices, foundations and endowments, was nominated for performance excellence in three categories for the 2017 HFMInvestHedge Awards on June 29, 2017.  The categories include Global Equity Fund - 1 Year, Global Equity Fund - 5 Years, and Global Macro Strategy (GMS) $100 million to $500 million - 1 Year.








Spruce has been nominated for the HFMInvestHedge Awards 13 times over the past 14 years, and has won three times.  "We are excited to once again be recognized by HFMInvestHedge," said John Bailey, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Spruce. "We have invested in hedged strategies for over 16 years and are pleased with the role they have played in helping us generate competitive long term returns for our clients."
Nominees were selected by HFMInvestHedge based upon risk- adjusted performance data through the end of April 2017. Final decisions are determined by performance through June 2017. 
About Spruce
Spruce Investment Advisors, LLC, is an award-winning wealth management firm based in Stamford, CT that serves as a Chief Investment Officer for family offices, foundations and endowments. Spruce advises on broadly diversified portfolios, including traditional investment portfolios of global equities, fixed income, high income, liquid absolute return, currencies and commodities, and alternative investment portfolios featuring hedge funds, private equity, real estate and oil & gas. Since 2001, Spruce has helped families and investors benefit from a broad and sophisticated array of global investment opportunities, aggressive risk management, and objective investment advice.
Important Disclosure:
For the HFMInvestHedge risk-adjusted performance related awards, funds of hedge funds must submit performance data to the HFMInvestHedge Database with no pro-forma data. For the one-year awards, the time frame will run from July 2016 to June 2017, while the five-year awards will run from July 2012 to June 2017. HFMInvestHedge will have the final say in which category a fund is nominated for. All funds need to have the most up-to-date performance in the HFMInvestHedge Database by July 31, 2017 or they will not be included in the nomination process for the HFMInvestHedge Awards for Performance Excellence. Nominations are primarily decided by those funds that achieve the strongest Sharpe ratios over the 12-month performance period under review, so long as they also beat the median returns in their relevant peer groups. The eventual winners will be the funds of hedge funds that achieve the best returns, as long as they also achieve Sharpe ratios within 25% of the best of the nominees.
This presentation does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any interest in any investment vehicle, and should not be relied on as such. Nor does this document, email or any attachment hereto disclose the risks or terms of an investment in any investment vehicle managed by Spruce or any of its affiliates. Solicitations can be made only with the applicable Fund's offering documents and only to qualified persons. For accredited investors with $10+ million only. Past performance is not indicative nor a guarantee of comparable future results.
Spruce did not compensate HFMInvestHedge for these nominations. Additional information about the 2017 HFMInvestHedge Awards can be found here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
