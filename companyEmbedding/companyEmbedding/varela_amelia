LONG ISLAND CITY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Steve Madden (Nasdaq:SHOO), a leading designer and marketer of fashion 
      footwear and accessories for women, men and children, today announced 
      two key executive promotions. Amelia Newton Varela has been named to the

      appointed to the newly created position of Chief Merchandising Officer.

      Madden in various roles, most recently as Executive Vice President of 
      Product Development.
    

      Edward Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, 
      “Amelia and Karla are both highly talented executives who have been 
      instrumental to the success and growth of our Company. Under Amelia’s 
      leadership, our wholesale business has grown exponentially over the last 
      decade, as we have expanded into new brands, new product categories and 
      new distribution channels. We look forward to her further contributions 
      as she broadens her role in the organization. Karla has proven herself 
      to have a deep understanding of product and trends, and we are confident 
      she will be highly successful in her role as Chief Merchandising 
      Officer. We are pleased to recognize the many contributions Amelia and

      Amelia in customer service and Karla in the stores. Over the years, I’ve 
      been proud to watch them develop into seasoned executives and 
      outstanding leaders that are imbued with the Steve Madden ethos. I know 
      they will be great in their new roles.”
