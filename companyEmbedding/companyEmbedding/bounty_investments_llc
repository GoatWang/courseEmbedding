About Bounty Minerals


Bounty Minerals buys oil and gas mineral interests in Appalachia.
In April of 2012, Jon Brumley created Bounty Minerals, LLC, a minerals acquisition partnership headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. The partnership acquires minerals exclusively in Appalachia. To date, Bounty Minerals has purchased over 61,000 net mineral acres in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Our approach is simple. We use economic models to calculate fair values for both buyer and seller. People choose to sell to Bounty Minerals because we are one of the top mineral buyers in the basin and have the ability to pay more than our competitors.
If you want immediate cash, Bounty Minerals gives you the opportunity to profit from your oil and gas mineral interests now, so that you may invest your profit elsewhere. There is no longer the need to wait for wells to be drilled on your property or tie your finances to the outcome of wells in your area.
If you sell Bounty a portion of your minerals, you may want Bounty to manage your remaining interest.  Bounty Minerals Management can help you administer the portion of the minerals you retain.  Therefore, you have the opportunity to receive immediate cash by selling a portion of your minerals while retaining an interest to participate in future revenues.


Why Bounty Minerals




Bounty has acquired over 61,000 acres – more than any other buyer in the heart of the play
Focusing only in Appalachia allows us to pay more for minerals
We provide a fair valuation on each purchase
We have the funds available to respond and to close quickly
We continually build relationships with operators and legislators

Selling Mineral Acreage is a big decision, it was important to us to work with a purchasing company that has a smooth well defined process that pays on time and at the agreed upon per acre price. We were very pleased to work with Bounty Minerals in both Ohio and Pennsylvania when selling our Mineral Acreage. Bounty paid on time and was very flexible in working with our 1031 exchange agency. We also felt that Bounty was very competitive with their price per acre offer right from the start. Thank you for making it a great experience for us.
Fred and Lisa VanDenHeuvel
Export,PAAmerican Mineral Solutions thoroughly enjoys its working relationship with Bounty Minerals and Bounty Minerals Management. Bounty offers consistency in the ever changing environment of Oil and Gas. Everything from start to finish is done right, on time, the first time. If situations arise throughout the acquisition process everyone at Bounty is pleased to help work with AMS and the landowner to make sure everyone’s expectations are met. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Bounty.

Why Have Bounty Manage Your Minerals.






Providing mineral monitoring services to royalty owners from a land and revenue perspective and protecting future revenue






Land Leasing Services


Revenue and Royalty Check Monitoring Services


Valuation of Oil and Gas













Oil and gas revenue checks are often paid incorrectly and these discrepancies, in some instances, equate to large amounts of revenue. Bounty Minerals Management is capable of reviewing, processing and independently analyzing these revenue statements.


Why Bounty Minerals Management



At the beginning of 2016, Mr. Brumley founded Bounty Minerals Management, a new company to benefit mineral owners in the Appalachian Basin.  Correctly managing minerals is time consuming, and at times, difficult.  Most oil and gas operators are fair and honest; however, a few are not even-handed, and even the best can make mistakes.  That is why it is important for mineral owners to be vigilant in lease negotiations and monitoring potentially excessive deductions from royalty payments.
If Bounty Minerals purchases a portion of your minerals, you will have the option of agreeing to let Bounty Minerals Management manage the minerals you retain.  Such management services can include lease negotiation, review and analysis of division orders, and review of royalty checks. If Bounty Minerals owns an interest in the same well or unit as your minerals, Bounty’s revenue accountants will already be studying the related division orders and deductions.  We will be looking to see if checks are issued in the proper amount and if too little royalty has been paid to the royalty owners.  If the payments are not correct, Bounty can contact the operator on behalf of both you and Bounty.  Often, the amount of such discrepancies would be too small to warrant a lawsuit; however, Bounty’s relationships and networking with operators can be extremely valuable in resolving these issues.  This is our business, and you can receive the same attention as Bounty.
If oil and gas interests constitute a substantial portion of your estate, heirs may be left to sift through the chaos and mountains of paperwork. It may even require experts with the ability to supervise future production. By allowing Bounty Minerals Management to purchase a portion of your assets while managing the remainder on your behalf, we can protect your oil and gas interests and royalty income for future generations by providing continuity during the transfer to the next generation.
The fee for Bounty Minerals Management services is small—just 2%-5% of the gross royalty that you receive.





Jon Brumley, the founder of Bounty Minerals Management, has 45 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including the formation of 6 oil and gas companies that were listed on the New York Stock Exchange
In 2005, Forbes Magazine named Mr. Brumley and his son, Jonny Brumley Entrepreneurs of the Year
Bounty Minerals has negotiated leases and has established relationships with the leading operators in Appalachia
Our revenue department analyzes royalty checks and post-production costs.
State of the art software assists in the management and analysis of assets.

Bounty Minerals has been more than fair on its prices. I have sold oil and gas rights to Bounty on two separate occasions. I tried dealing with another company, but it was a very slow process and I could never get ahold of anybody. Bounty was always available to answer my questions. Bounty is a very honest and fair company and I received more than I thought I would on both sales. I was very satisfied.

                            Get ready to be selecting sizes for a long time because Bounty® Select-A-Size™ paper towels are 2X more absorbent*! Which means you can use less.

Not happy with last purchase





I am loyal to bounty paper towels, I love the select a size. Now the problem, the last pack I bought I believe 12 pack are not perforated all the way to the end. I have tried 3 rolls thinking it was just one but nope so far all three have been the same. So when you tear off you don't get the whole towel. The UPS is 3700096900. Very frustrating and now I



I do recommend this product.

Poor quality





I was trying to save some money, these were on sale and I had a coupon, worst product I have ever purchased. I would say, stay away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love BASIC paper towels





The name may be BASIC, but they are anything but! I really love these paper towels. Their strong, and could definitely stand up against the big boys. And the price is right.



I do recommend this product.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



HOW DO I CANCEL MY NEWSLETTER?

                                                    If you'd prefer to unsubscribe from our newsletter, simply click the unsubscribe button at the bottom of any newsletter from us. You can also contact us through the contact form on our website to request you be unsubseribed, and we'll be happy to remove your contact details.
                                                


ARE STOCKS RISKY?

                                                   All stocks carry an inherent risk. Only a small percentage of penny stocks are in fast companies with good foundations and solid financials. We aim to take the guesswork out of penny stock investing and provide our members with expert advice on companies with great potential.
                                                


HOW CAN I START TRADING PENNY STOCKS?

                                                   We do not trade stocks and are not investment advisors, nor can we handle your investment for you. What you can do to start though, is sign up for a brokerage account that has easy access to penny stocks. We recommend common firms like Firstrade, Scottrade, or Tradestation.
                                                


HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED TO GET STARTED?

                                                   It's up to you! Many of our members started with just $100 and moved on to trade in thousands. 
                                                


WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY NEWSLETTER?

                                             Newsletters are sent via e-mail to the e-mail inbox address that you signed up on our site with.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



HOW DO I CANCEL MY NEWSLETTER?

                                                    If you'd prefer to unsubscribe from our newsletter, simply click the unsubscribe button at the bottom of any newsletter from us. You can also contact us through the contact form on our website to request you be unsubseribed, and we'll be happy to remove your contact details.
                                                


ARE STOCKS RISKY?

                                                   All stocks carry an inherent risk. Only a small percentage of penny stocks are in fast companies with good foundations and solid financials. We aim to take the guesswork out of penny stock investing and provide our members with expert advice on companies with great potential.
                                                


HOW CAN I START TRADING PENNY STOCKS?

                                                   We do not trade stocks and are not investment advisors, nor can we handle your investment for you. What you can do to start though, is sign up for a brokerage account that has easy access to penny stocks. We recommend common firms like Firstrade, Scottrade, or Tradestation.
                                                


HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED TO GET STARTED?

                                                   It's up to you! Many of our members started with just $100 and moved on to trade in thousands.

ARE STOCKS RISKY?

                                                   All stocks carry an inherent risk. Only a small percentage of penny stocks are in fast companies with good foundations and solid financials. We aim to take the guesswork out of penny stock investing and provide our members with expert advice on companies with great potential.
                                                


HOW CAN I START TRADING PENNY STOCKS?

                                                   We do not trade stocks and are not investment advisors, nor can we handle your investment for you. What you can do to start though, is sign up for a brokerage account that has easy access to penny stocks. We recommend common firms like Firstrade, Scottrade, or Tradestation.

                                                   It's up to you! Many of our members started with just $100 and moved on to trade in thousands.
