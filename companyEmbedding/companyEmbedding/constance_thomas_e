5.0 out of 5 starsConstance is another Rosie Thomas ClassicByjevaon April 23, 2013Thomas is such a skilful writer that I coped really well with the toing and froing between generations whcih I usually hate.  In this book I understood why it read better by jumping sometimes back and forward. Always for me, a strong female character with very human flaws makes the story very real  and the character very believable. As always with Thomas I was torn between wanting to read through the night and not put it down til the end or, rationing the story as I didnt want to finish it (I did the latter). So now I wait until another Rosie Thomas book appears, I've read all her others and not one has been disappointing.

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsConstanceByJuleson March 25, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI would have to say that this was not the best novel of Thomas' that I have read, however it was well written.  Thomas has a real knack of dealing with very delicate issues and in this novel it was with approaching mortality, family conflicts, betrayal and forgiveness, learning what is important.  The surroundings and characters were all well portrayed.  Overall it was a good novel.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Not quite as good as Rosie Thomas's previous books I have read.Good story but the love affair starting when Constance was just a young girl was not fully convincing for me. Other than that this book was a good read and worthwhile.0Comment|
