About Hahn Capital Management


 Hahn Capital Management, LLC, is a boutique, value-focused investment management firm based in San Francisco, California. We specialize in buying shares of mid-sized companies with a market capitalization between $1 Billion and $20 Billion.
Chosen as the 2015 Mid-Cap Equity Manager of the Year in Emerging Manager Monthly's 10th Annual Emerging Manager Awards 
The firm was founded on the investment philosophy that risk management is the key to superior and consistent equity returns over long periods of time. The protection of our clients' investment capital is at the core of our investment decision process, so when analyzing each business opportunity, the first question we ask is: "How much can we lose?" Once this question is addressed, we then examine the potential investment return.
The firm was founded in 1988 by Elaine F. Hahn. It is 100 percent employee-owned, as we believe that all professionals in the firm should have the opportunity to share in the growth and success of the business through equity ownership. 
Our diverse group of clients includes public institutions, corporations, family offices, Separately Managed Account (SMA) and Unified Managed Account (UMA) programs, as well as high net worth individuals. We strive to provide the highest quality of service to our clients, irrespective of the size of each portfolio.
Our team of investment professionals has extensive experience in market and security analysis, portfolio management and client service. More important, we share the values and goals that have served our clients well over the years: honesty, trustworthiness, dedication to excellence, and a passion for the investment business.

                Process
 


Investment Process


Our investment process is value-focused, fundamental and bottom-up in nature and is designed to remove emotion from our portfolio management decisions.
Our universe of mid-cap companies encompasses approximately 3500 publicly traded companies traded on the U.S. stock exchanges with market capitalizations between $1 billion and $20 billion. We look for companies and/or industries where there is positive fundamental change taking place, but where this change has not yet been recognized by the broader investment community. 
A research-driven process seeking long-term Value Creation
At the industry level, we focus on industries in transition, out-of-favor, or out-of-cycle sectors where we can identify an inflection point leading to improving supply/demand and pricing fundamentals or to consolidation within the industry. At the company level, the firm looks for changes that will lead to improving and more sustainable profitability, such as a change in the management, a restructuring of the business, or a new proprietary product or service. 
While "positive change" is the pre-requisite element to identifying a potential investment candidate, there must also be a Value Creator. A Value Creator is the facilitator of change that transforms the company or industry into a more profitable entity. Industry value creators may include 1) new legislation or regulations; 2) technological innovation; or, 3) an improving supply/demand structure. Company-specific value creators may include 1) a transforming acquisition; 2) the sale or divestiture of an underperforming business; or, 3) introduction of a new set of products, solutions or services. The underlying rationale behind the search for Value Creators is to avoid value traps, defined as undervalued businesses with no path toward recognition of such value.

 The guiding principle behind our investment philosophy is to address the risk of an investment first, then the return potential.  In this phase of our process, our goal is to identify and quantify, where possible, those risks that would be unacceptable and thus would preclude our purchase of a company, as well as those that are within acceptable levels.
We endeavor to apply consistently a research-driven investment process in an effort to separate unacceptable risks from acceptable uncertainties and to estimate intrinsic value of an enterprise.  The process is fundamental and bottom-up in nature and aims to remove emotion from our portfolio management. The result is a proven track record of value-added decisions predicated on independent judgments and long-term time horizon.

                Philosophy
 


Investment Philosophy


The foundation of Hahn Capital Management's investment philosophy is that risk management is the key to superior long-term investment results. Our primary objective is to preserve capital by avoiding companies with a high risk profile. However, we understand that investing in equities carries some degree of risk. We manage and control risk in three ways:
  *	By identifying and investing only in high-quality companies, which we define as companies with superior balance sheets, sustainable competitive advantage and seasoned management teams with demonstrable track records of success.
Risk management is key to superior results
  *	By isolating and separating risk factors into either acceptable or unacceptable categories. We avoid investing in companies with risks that fall into the unacceptable category.
  *	By buying only our best ideas and knowing these companies better than the market. Our hurdle is high, so as a result, we own only 30-35 stocks in our client portfolios.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Hahn Capital Management Mid-Cap Equity





















Home
 


About Hahn Capital Management


 Hahn Capital Management, LLC, is a boutique, value-focused investment management firm based in San Francisco, California. We specialize in buying shares of mid-sized companies with a market capitalization between $1 Billion and $20 Billion.
Chosen as the 2015 Mid-Cap Equity Manager of the Year in Emerging Manager Monthly's 10th Annual Emerging Manager Awards 
The firm was founded on the investment philosophy that risk management is the key to superior and consistent equity returns over long periods of time. The protection of our clients' investment capital is at the core of our investment decision process, so when analyzing each business opportunity, the first question we ask is: "How much can we lose?" Once this question is addressed, we then examine the potential investment return.
The firm was founded in 1988 by Elaine F. Hahn. It is 100 percent employee-owned, as we believe that all professionals in the firm should have the opportunity to share in the growth and success of the business through equity ownership. 
Our diverse group of clients includes public institutions, corporations, family offices, Separately Managed Account (SMA) and Unified Managed Account (UMA) programs, as well as high net worth individuals. We strive to provide the highest quality of service to our clients, irrespective of the size of each portfolio.
Our team of investment professionals has extensive experience in market and security analysis, portfolio management and client service. More important, we share the values and goals that have served our clients well over the years: honesty, trustworthiness, dedication to excellence, and a passion for the investment business.
