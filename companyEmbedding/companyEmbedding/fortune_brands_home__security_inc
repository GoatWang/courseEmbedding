If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Our History, Our Legacy
Behind our profitable growth is a long heritage of trusted, well-known brands.

MasterBrand Cabinets is home to dozens of brands that have been around for 30, 40 and 50 years. Kemper cabinetry, started in 1926, is the oldest cabinet brand in our portfolio. Aristokraft cabinetry, founded in 1954, was the first cabinet brand to join the Fortune Brands family.
Moen celebrated its 75th year anniversary in 2014. Since its existence, Moen has been creating innovations that enhance people's lives. Moen invented the world’s first single-handle faucet, allowing consumers to easily adjust tap water temperature since 1947.
Therma-Tru came into being more than 50 years ago. In 1983, Therma-Tru introduced the first fiberglass door, giving the public a much more energy-efficient and durable door compared to their wood counterparts.
Master Lock was founded in 1921 and invented the world’s first laminated padlock. Master Lock’s Milwaukee manufacturing plant has been operating since 1939.
SentrySafe has been providing personal safes since 1930, pioneering the fire- and water-resistant protective security containers for the masses.

Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS) is an American manufacturer of home fixtures and hardware, headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois. The company's product lines include Master Lock, Sentry Safe, MasterBrand Cabinets, Moen faucets, Therma-Tru entry door systems, and Waterloo tool storage products.[3] The company has said that it holds market leadership positions in all of its segments, and has 16,000 associates that generated $5.0 billion in net sales in 2016.[3]
Fortune Brands Home & Security was created on October 3, 2011 from part of the former Fortune Brands holding company.[3] The spin-off was related to the pre-announced corporate strategy of divesting unrelated product lines to focus on the liquor business.[4][5] On the day after spinning off FBHS, Fortune Brands renamed itself as Beam Inc. to reflect this new strategy.[6] Beam Inc. was subsequently purchased by Suntory to become its Beam Suntory subsidiary in April, 2014.[7][8]
On October 18, 2011, it was announced that Pershing Square Capital Management owned a 15% stake in the company, and considered its stock to be a very attractive investment.[9]

Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS) is an American manufacturer of home fixtures and hardware, headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois. The company's product lines include Master Lock, Sentry Safe, MasterBrand Cabinets, Moen faucets, Therma-Tru entry door systems, and Waterloo tool storage products.[3] The company has said that it holds market leadership positions in all of its segments, and has 16,000 associates that generated $5.0 billion in net sales in 2016.[3]
Fortune Brands Home & Security was created on October 3, 2011 from part of the former Fortune Brands holding company.[3] The spin-off was related to the pre-announced corporate strategy of divesting unrelated product lines to focus on the liquor business.[4][5] On the day after spinning off FBHS, Fortune Brands renamed itself as Beam Inc. to reflect this new strategy.[6] Beam Inc. was subsequently purchased by Suntory to become its Beam Suntory subsidiary in April, 2014.[7][8]
On October 18, 2011, it was announced that Pershing Square Capital Management owned a 15% stake in the company, and considered its stock to be a very attractive investment.[9]
