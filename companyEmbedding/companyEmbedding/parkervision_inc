ParkerVision, Inc.

Reinventing the Transmit Chain for Next-Generation  Multimode Wireless Devices




Upcoming generations of radio access standards are placing high  demands on the RF transmit chain, requiring significant improvements in  size, integration, and functionality while improving power efficiency  for multimode wireless devices. To date, trends in RF integration have  been to add redundant circuits to accommodate new standards, packing  more complexity into the circuit, and then shrinking it. However, this  approach often requires a necessary compromise in performance and yield,  with physical limits in terms of overall size reductions.  Review this  white paper on a new approach that incorporates a streamlined  architecture to accommodate the additional levels of complexity due to  multimode functionality, while improving efficiency, yield, and size,  and meeting regulatory compliance.






This ParkerVision application note addresses two common questions regarding the PV line of  demodulator/modulators. 

Use of non-sinusoid LO 
Operation with single ended LO.
It is written for the PVD5870, but is equally applicable to the 5871, 4840,  and 4841.
