Elwood Energy, Exelon Generation sign long-term PPA








04/23/2001









































CHICAGO, April 20, 2001  Elwood Energy, LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Peoples Energy Corporation and Dominion, today announced a multi-year power purchase agreement with Exelon Generation Company, LLC, for the remaining 150-megawatt output of Elwood's phase II expansion of its gas-fired, peaking facility.  This agreement supplements existing power sales arrangements between Elwood Energy and Commonwealth Edison Company, which transferred its interests to Exelon Generation Company, LLC.Exelon Generation also entered into an agreement to purchase 750 megawatts of generation from Elwood for the period of 2005 until 2012."We have successfully contracted all of the capacity for the phase II expansion, which is scheduled to come online in June," said Thomas Patrick, president and chief operating officer of Peoples Energy.  "This arrangement helps to ensure the continued growth of Elwood.""With this agreement, Dominion Energy has taken another critical step forward in its plan to become a leading energy provider in the Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, home to 40 percent of the nation's demand for energy," said Thomas F. Farrell, chief executive officer of Dominion Energy.  "Our facility at Elwood is an increasingly important anchor for Dominion in this area of the nation.""We are excited about adding this product into our portfolio of reliable resources in this region and look forward to our continuing relationship with Elwood," said Ian McLean, president, Exelon Power Team, the wholesale marketing division of Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC).[Native Advertisement]When the expanded facility becomes operational this summer, it will more than double the capacity of Elwood's existing 600-megawatt merchant facility, bringing the site's total capacity to 1,350 MW.  Elwood began operation in the summer of 1999.  The facility, which is located 60 miles southwest of Chicago in Elwood, Illinois, will expand to nine natural gas-fired turbines from four turbines.  Construction of the expanded project commenced in October 2000 and is entering final testing in the next several weeks.The facility is adjacent to multiple interstate natural gas pipelines that provide access to competitively priced gas supplies from all major gas producing regions of the United States.  The facility is also close to a high capacity ComEd transmission corridor that provides access to the wholesale electric market.Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Va., is one of the nation's largest producers of energy, with production capability of 2.7 trillion British Thermal Units of energy per day.  Dominion has a power generation portfolio of more than 21,000 megawatts, which is expected to grow to more than 28,000 megawatts by 2005.  Dominion is also one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in North America, with 2.8 trillion cubic feet of equivalent reserves.  The company has 7,600 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline with more than 650 billion cubic feet of annual natural gas throughput. Dominion also serves 3.8 million retail natural gas and electric customers.  (http://www.dom.com ).Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with approximately five million customers and more than $15 billion in annual revenues.  The company has one of the industry's largest portfolios of electricity generation capacity, with a nationwide reach and strong positions in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.  Exelon distributes electricity and gas to approximately five million customers in Illinois and Pennsylvania.  The company also has holdings in such competitive businesses as energy, infrastructure services and energy services.  Exelon is headquartered in Chicago and trades on the NYSE under the ticker EXC.

ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC

In October 2008, Energy Capital announced the formation of ADA Carbon Solutions (“ACS”) to develop and construct an activated carbon (“AC”) production facility in Coushatta, Louisiana.


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








ACS was formed in anticipation of federal and state regulations requiring mercury removal from coal-fired power plant emissions. ACS designed and built what Energy Capital believes is the largest, most automated and most environmentally friendly AC manufacturing plant in North America focused on mitigating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The facility, which is called Red River, was completed in 2010, can produce 150 million pounds per year of AC and has begun shipping product to utility customers. In addition, ACS developed its own dedicated source of raw material, the Five Forks Mine, located in close proximity to the Red River plant.
 
In December 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) released its final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”), which set stringent new federal limits on hazardous emissions from the nation’s coal and oil-fired power plants. After a few delays, the rule went into full effect for all U.S. coal plants in April 2016.

STEAG SCR-Tech

In August 2011, Energy Capital acquired CoaLogix, the established leader in selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) management services and catalyst regeneration technologies used by coal-fired power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. In January 2016, CoaLogix merged with competitor STEAG Energy Services, forming STEAG SCR-Tech. 


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








STEAG SCR-Tech provides innovative, cost-effective solutions that help utility customers achieve and maintain compliance with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. SCR is the leading control technology for reducing NOx emissions from coal-fired power plants worldwide. Within an SCR system, power plant flue gas reacts with a catalyst enabling a chemical reaction to transform NOx emissions into environmentally friendly, nitrogen and water vapor. Over time, catalysts in the SCR system must be replaced or regenerated to maintain effective NOx reduction. Through its proprietary processes, STEAG SCR-Tech regenerates deactivated catalysts at a substantial discount relative to the replacement cost of catalysts, while also eliminating the need for catalyst disposal and catalyst inventory storage. With operations in China and a large European customer base, STEAG SCR-Tech provides a vital global service for reducing coal plant emissions.For more information about STEAG SCR-Tech, visit the company’s website at www.steagscrtech.com/us-home.
