About Network Integrity Systems
Network Integrity Systems Inc. was founded in 2003 in Conover, North Carolina, USA, by optical engineers and management personnel from a global fiber optics leader and Norscan Inc..
In 2002, Norscan, a leader in telephony cable system monitoring products, addressed a requirement from the Department of Defense to develop an improved Alarmed Carrier PDS solution for protecting secure fiber optic networks in and around The Pentagon. This resulted in the development of the INTERCEPTOR™ Optical Network Security System which meets National Security Agency requirements (IAW NSTISSI 7003 and NSTISSI 3215) and provides superior protection of fiber-optic data and telecommunications lines for military and government secure networks.
In subsequent years, Network Integrity Systems received funding from the US Army Intelligence & Security Command (INSCOM) and the US Air Force Information Warfare Battlelab to accelerate technology development and make enhancements to the INTERCEPTOR product line – resulting in unparalleled protection, that can be installed on ANY optical fiber (singlemode or multimode, lit or dark) and 100% compatible with all applicable networking standards up to and including 10-Gigabit Ethernet.
Today INTERCEPTOR solves key issues associated with the growing mandate to guard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of national security information – and the C4ISR networks used to transmit or receive it.  INTERCEPTOR is the only commercially available alarmed carrier PDS developed under DoD guidance and financing specifically for information assurance and IT security applications. Eighteen (18) U.S. and International patents have been granted to NIS for technologies incorporated in or enabled by INTERCEPTOR. Since it’s introduction, INTERCEPTOR has been successfully deployed across the globe to monitor U.S. government classified networks.

Network Integrity Systems Inc. Key Developments

Network Integrity Systems and CyberSecure IPS Introduce Cyber Security for Public and Private Sectors
Oct 7 15
Network Integrity Systems and CyberSecure IPS will combine their patented products into an unrivalled cyber security solution to benefit private enterprise and government agencies. The two companies have entered into an exclusive relationship to integrate their best-of-breed technologies into a single solution.  The product lines INTERCEPTOR CS for government and VANGUARD CS for private enterprise are a direct countermeasure against growing threats to information security and the increased number of attacks on fiber optic networks. The combined solution provides immediate detection of cyber attacks on the physical layer (cables and interconnection points). These systems can be centrally managed from anywhere in the world and provide first responders with an early warning, affording them time to act and greater potential to prevent damage or theft of data. A unique benefit of the CS solution called Fiber Forensics provides investigators with critical information to assist in profiling methods of attack, helping to prevent future attacks. The INTERCEPTOR Optical Network Security System and the CyberSecure Infrastructure Management System (IMS) have been widely deployed in the U.S. government to secure classified networks. The VANGUARD CS solution will be offered to non-government industries including energy and utilities, business enterprise, banking and securities, healthcare, higher education, transportation and casino gaming to provide the same cyber security benefits.
