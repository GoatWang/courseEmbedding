Umpqua Holdings Corporation, d.b.a. Umpqua Bank, is a financial holding company based in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States. Headquarters are in the Umpqua Bank Plaza, formerly the headquarters of Benj. Franklin Savings and Loan. The firm has three principal operating subsidiaries: Umpqua Bank (the Bank), Umpqua Investments (formerly Strand, Atkinson, Williams and York (Investments)), and Pivotus Ventures.
The company’s main operating segments are personal banking and lending, business banking and lending, and wealth management. The bank serves consumers and businesses in the community.[1] As of 2015, Umpqua Bank had $24 billion in assets and $18 billion in deposits and was ranked among the largest 60 banks in the nation.[2] Its parent company, Umpqua Holdings, is publicly traded.[1] As of 2016, Umpqua Bank was the largest Oregon-based bank, and had 350 branches in Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada and Idaho.[3][4]
History[edit]




Company headquarters in Portland


South Umpqua State Bank was formed in 1953 in Canyonville, Oregon, with six employees. It was started by a group of people working in the timber business who wanted to create a means for their employees to cash their payroll checks. The bank opened with capital of $50,000 and surplus and reserves of $25,000.[5] The bank’s first savings account was opened by Pete Duchene, a local business agent. D.B. “Tex” Ritter and his wife Nadine opened the first commercial account for their South Umpqua Trucking Company.[6]
In 2002, Umpqua increased its number of branches to 63 by acquiring Centennial Bancorp of Eugene Oregon for $214 million.[7] On January 16, 2009, Umpqua agreed to assume the deposits of Vancouver, Washington-based Bank of Clark County after the latter bank was seized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.[8] Umpqua agreed to assume the deposits of Seattle, Washington-based Evergreen Bank in January 2010 after the latter was closed by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed receiver.[9] A month later the company agreed to take over the deposits of Tacoma, Washington-based Rainier Pacific Bank, after it was seized by the FDIC.[10] The next month, Umpqua acquired the banking operations of Rainier Pacific Bank in a purchase agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[11]
Umpqua continued with acquisitions in 2012 when they attempted to buy California based American Perspective Bank for $44.7 million, which would have added two branches to Umpqua's then 196 branches.[12] The deal fell through, however, when Umpqua was outbid, though American Perspective paid Umpqua a $1.6 million fee to terminate the deal.[13] Umpqua had been expanding into the San Francisco Bay Area,[4] and closed a $24.9 million deal to buy Bay area-based Circle Bancorp in November 2012.[14]
In September 2013, Umpqua announced it would buy Sterling Financial Corporation, parent of Sterling Bank, the second largest bank in Washington.[15] The $2 billion deal closed in April 2014 and increased the number of bank branches to 394 and increase assets to $22 billion.[15]
Current CEO and President of Umpqua Holdings Corp, Raymond Davis, took over the local 40-person South Umpqua Bank in 1994. Davis became CEO and President of Umpqua Holdings in 1999.[16] In 2007, Davis authored a book titled Leading for Growth: How Umpqua Bank Got Cool and Created a Culture of Greatness.[17] Cort O’Haver became President in April 2016, with Davis retaining the role of CEO. Davis plans to step down as CEO in January 2017. O’Haver will take over as CEO at that point while Davis will become executive chair of the bank's board and will continue to oversee Pivotus Ventures Inc.[18]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  This Report contains certain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of   demand for financial services in our market areas;   competitive market pricing factors;   our ability to effectively develop and implement new technology;   deterioration in economic conditions that could result in increased loan and lease losses;   risks associated with concentrations in real estate related loans;   market interest rate volatility;   compression of our net interest margin;   stability of funding sources and continued availability of borrowings;   changes in legal or regulatory requirements or the results of regulatory examinations that could increase expenses or restrict growth;   our ability to recruit and retain key management and staff;   availability of, and competition for, acquisition opportunities;   risks associated with merger and acquisition integration;   significant decline in the market value of the Company that could result in an impairment of goodwill;   our ability to raise capital or incur debt on reasonable terms;   regulatory limits on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company;   the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other new legislation on the Company's business operations, including our compliance costs, interest expense, and revenue;   the impact of Basel III capital rules issued by federal banking regulators; and   competition, including from financial technology companies.  There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. Readers should consider any forward-looking statements in light of this explanation, and we caution readers about relying on forward-looking statements.  Table of Contents  General  With headquarters located in Roseburg, Oregon, the Bank is considered one of the most innovative community banks in the United States, recognized nationally and internationally for its unique company culture and customer experience strategy, which differentiate the Company from its competition. The Bank provides a wide range of banking, wealth management, mortgage and other financial services to corporate, institutional and individual customers, and also has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Pacific Leasing, Inc., a commercial equipment leasing company.  Umpqua Investments is a registered broker-dealer and registered investment advisor with offices in Oregon, Washington, and California, and also offers products and services through Umpqua Bank stores. The firm is one of the oldest investment companies in the Northwest and is actively engaged in the communities it serves. Umpqua Investments offers a full range of investment products and services including: stocks, fixed income securities (municipal, corporate, and government bonds, CDs, and money market instruments), mutual funds, options, retirement planning, advisory account services, goals based planning, insurance and annuities.  In 2015, we formed Pivotus Ventures, Inc. as a subsidiary of Umpqua Holdings Corporation. Pivotus will use a startup dynamic and collaboration with other institutions to validate, develop, and test new bank platforms that could have a significant impact on the experience and economics of banking. We believe the collaborative model will enhance Pivotus' ability to imagine and develop disruptive technologies, test them with a broad range of customers and deliver them at scale.  Along with its subsidiaries, the Company is subject to the regulations of state and federal agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by these regulatory agencies.  Executive Overview  Significant items for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were as follows:  Financial Performance   Net earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share were $0.21 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.22 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.   Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.85% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 4.34% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflects lower interest income, primarily attributable to lower average yields on the loan and lease portfolio and taxable investments, as well as an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.   Residential mortgage banking revenue was $26.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase as compared to the prior period is principally attributable to a lower negative fair value adjustment of $7.7 million on the MSR asset for the three months ended March 31, 2017, relative to the negative fair value adjustment of $20.6 million in the same period of the prior year. The gain on sale margin decreased to 3.27% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 3.72% in the same period of the prior year, driving lower revenue from the origination and sale of residential mortgages over the same period.   Total gross loans and leases were $17.8 billion as of March 31, 2017, an increase of $321.0 million, as compared to December 31, 2016. The increase was due to balanced growth in the Company's commercial term, commercial real-estate non-owner occupied term, leases & equipment finance and consumer portfolios.   Total deposits were $19.2 billion as of March 31, 2017, an increase of $146.3 million, compared to December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in non-interest bearing demand and savings accounts, partially offset by a decrease in public funds, which was attributable to a combination of seasonal fluctuations and targeted run-off.   Total consolidated assets were $24.9 billion as of March 31, 2017, compared to $24.8 billion at December 31, 2016.  Table of Contents  Credit Quality   Non-performing assets decreased to $58.9 million, or 0.24% of total assets, as of March 31, 2017, as compared to $62.9 million, or 0.25% of total assets, as of December 31, 2016. Non-performing loans were $52.3 million, or 0.29% of total loans, as of March 31, 2017, as compared to $56.1 million, or 0.32% of total loans, as of December 31, 2016.   The provision for loan and lease losses was $11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the $4.8 million recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to strong growth in the loan portfolio, as well as an increase in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $9.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, or 0.22% of average loans and leases (annualized), as compared to net charge-offs of $4.9 million, or 0.12% of average loans and leases (annualized), for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Capital and Growth Initiatives   The Company's total risk based capital was 14.5% and its Tier 1 common to risk weighted assets ratio was 11.3% as of March 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's total risk based capital ratio was 14.7% and its Tier 1 common to risk weighted assets ratio was 11.5%.   Cash dividends declared in the first quarter of 2017 were $0.16 per common share, consistent with the comparable period of the prior year.  Table of Contents  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2017. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  The Bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards. When loans and leases are originated, they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process. The Bank's risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from 1 to 10, where a higher rating represents higher risk. The 10 risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Bank has a management Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ("ALLL") Committee, which is responsible for, among other things, regularly reviewing the ALLL methodology, including loss factors, and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The ALLL Committee reviews and approves loans and leases recommended for impaired status. The ALLL Committee also approves removing loans and leases from impaired status. The Bank's Audit and Compliance Committee provides board oversight of the ALLL process and reviews and approves the ALLL methodology on a quarterly basis.  Each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating. Credit loss factors may vary by region based on management's belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region.  Regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired. Potentially impaired loans are referred to the ALLL Committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired. A loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows. If we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses or charge-off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss. The combination of the risk rating-based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses.  The Bank may also maintain an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan and lease portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors. This unallocated amount generally comprises less than 5% of the allowance, but may be maintained at higher levels during times of economic conditions characterized by falling real estate values. The unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses, the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends. As of March 31, 2017, there was no unallocated allowance amount.  The RUC is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds, such as with a letter or line of credit. The adequacy of the ALLL and RUC are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management's evaluation of numerous factors. These factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio; the trend in the loan portfolio's risk ratings; current economic conditions; loan concentrations; loan growth rates; past-due and non-performing trends; evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans; historical charge-off and recovery experience; and other pertinent information.  Management believes that the ALLL was adequate as of March 31, 2017. There is, however, no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses. In addition, bank regulatory authorities, as part of their periodic examination of the Bank, may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review. A substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, as a result a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.  Table of Contents  Acquired Loans  Acquired loans and leases are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. For purchased non-impaired loans, the difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income using the effective interest method over the remaining contractual period to maturity.  Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSR")  The Company determines its classes of servicing assets based on the asset type being serviced along with the methods used to manage the risk inherent in the servicing assets, which includes the market inputs used to value the servicing assets. The Company measures its residential mortgage servicing assets at fair value and reports changes in fair value through earnings. Fair value adjustments encompass market-driven valuation changes and the runoff in value that occurs from the passage of time, which are separately reported. Under the fair value method, the MSR is carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings under the caption residential mortgage banking revenue in the period in which the change occurs.  Retained mortgage servicing rights are measured at fair value as of the date of the related loan sale. We use quoted market prices when available. Subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model. In order to determine the fair value of the MSR, the present value of expected net future cash flows is estimated. Assumptions used include market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, delinquency and foreclosure rates, and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs. This model is periodically validated by an independent external model validation group. The model assumptions and the MSR fair value estimates are also compared to observable trades of similar portfolios as well as to MSR broker valuations and industry surveys, as available.  Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment. Management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of December 31. Additionally, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. The impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. There can be no assurance that changes in circumstances, estimates or assumptions may result in additional impairment of all, or some portion of, goodwill or other intangible assets.  The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis of the Community Banking reporting segment as of December 31, 2016. The Company assessed qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicated that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, and determined no factors indicated an impairment.  Table of Contents  Stock-based Compensation  We recognize expense in the income statement for the grant-date fair value of restricted shares and stock options as equity-based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees' requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions. The fair value of the restricted shares is based on the Company's share price on the grant date. Management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the pricing model, and ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the expected service period related to each option.  Fair Value  A hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability is utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates Topic 606 and supersedes Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which postponed the effective date of 2014-09. Multiple ASUs and interpretative guidance have been issued in connection with ASU 2014-09. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In general, the new guidance requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The standard is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is not permitted. For financial reporting purposes, the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has begun their process to implement this new standard. The Company has started by reviewing all revenue sources to determine the sources that are in scope for this guidance. As a bank, key revenue sources, such as interest income have been identified as out of scope of this new guidance. The Company has not yet determined the financial statement impact this guidance will have.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. This ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. In addition, the amendment requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. This ASU also eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The amendment also requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument specific credit risk (also referred to as "own credit") when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Table of Contents  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this update require lessees, among other things, to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous authoritative guidance. This update also introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has established a project team, for the implementation of this new standard. The team is currently working with a vendor to put a new leasing software in place that will support the current leasing process, as well as aid in the transition to the new leasing guidance. Although an estimate of the impact of the new leasing standard has not yet been determined, the Company expects a significant new lease asset and related lease liability on the balance sheet due to the number of leased properties the Bank currently has that are accounted for under current operating lease guidance.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for certain financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates, but will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio.
