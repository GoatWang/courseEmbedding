Our Infrastructure








At Man Group, we believe that our infrastructure is crucial in allowing our front office to maintain an uninterrupted focus on growing clients’ assets.
Our experienced management team is committed to investing in infrastructure over the short and long terms. In doing this we are confident that we will be able to maintain best-in-class offerings in Technology, Compliance, Human Resources, Legal, Operations and Facilities.
We firmly believe our infrastructure is one of our key commercial differentiators, maintaining our position at the forefront of the asset management industry and allowing us to constantly evolve and adapt as our client’s needs do.




 

Technology
Operations
Risk Management
Compliance & Legal





We use advanced scientific methods to help inform our investment decisions.
Man Group believes that technology will play a key role in the future of active management. Our commitment to research in this area can be seen in many ways. We collaborate with the University of Oxford on machine learning techniques through the Oxford-Man Institute, we seek to hire the very best quantitative talent to lead our research efforts and we invest in cutting edge hardware, such as GPU computing.
These efforts often involve input from all five of our investment management businesses. In doing this, we are facilitating the effective cross-pollination of ideas, both within Man Group, and between ourselves and the academic community, which we believe will help give an edge to our investment activities.







Investment in technology is key to the on-going success of our business.
Man Group’s investment managers trade across many different asset classes, geographies and product styles. We invest in technology to help ensure we are at the forefront of investment and risk management, trading and operations.
Rosa, our proprietary central operational platform, delivers a co-ordinated process for the firm’s trading as well as enhancing risk controls and expanding the analytics available to our portfolio managers. As regulatory requirements and clients’ expectations develop, this single central system also delivers high quality, timely and dynamic reporting.
We believe this capability allows us to respond to our clients’ needs and market opportunities with greater speed, flexibility and assurance.







Robust risk management systems are essential to ensuring our duty of stewardship to our clients.
Man Group maintains rigorous oversight of counterparty exposures, group-wide liquidity and balance sheet risk. We also regularly conduct market stress tests to prepare ourselves as thoroughly as possible for potential future adverse conditions. Finally, our Risk & Finance Committee reviews our operational risk profile and challenges the adequacy of risk mitigation wherever necessary.
The firm’s risk teams operate across the entirety of the firm, and are embedded within the most senior levels of our organisation. Risk teams are also deeply involved with our investment management businesses on a day-to-day level, monitoring risk concentrations and conducting other quantitative factor analyses.







In an ever-changing regulatory landscape, we are committed to effectively combining accountability with high organisational performance.
Man Group’s corporate entities are regulated in multiple jurisdictions worldwide, putting the firm at the forefront of today’s complex global investment landscape. In this environment, our compliance and legal functions have a simple aim: to ensure that doing the right thing is the easiest and most effective way of operating.
We invest in the people and processes to support our aim of achieving the highest standards in compliance. Our legal teams are located across all the firm’s jurisdictions, to help ensure that we fully understand the context and impact of varying requirements.
We employ a ‘three lines of defence model’ to ensure our employees have the flexibility to create solutions applicable to our clients’ needs, but to do this in an appropriately controlled environment. We believe that this instils a culture of compliance into all personnel. This is consistent with our commitment to run our business to the highest standards, and for the long term.





 









Oxford-Man Institute



The Oxford-Man Institute ('OMI') is our unique collaboration with the University of Oxford. Over the last decade, the OMI, part of the university’s Department of Engineering Science, has been conducting pioneering research into quantitative finance, and now focuses primarily on machine learning techniques and data analytics.


We believe this initiative is highly supportive of the on-going evolution of our quantitative investment strategies. We are constantly being presented with new and expanding datasets and machine learning has a huge amount to offer in interpreting this information.
Located in the same building as Man AHL’s Oxford Research Lab, the OMI provides us with a direct connection to cutting-edge machine learning research and allows for the fruitful cross-pollination of ideas between the investment and academic communities. The work undertaken at the OMI, in areas as seemingly unrelated to investment as galaxy classification and measurement of the height of tides, has directly contributed to our investment methodologies. We actively use machine-learning techniques in our trading programmes and these have become a genuinely value-adding approach for our clients.


​











Our History



With a trading history spanning more than 230 years, and over 25 years of experience of global investment management, Man Group offers longevity and durability in a rapidly changing financial world. Each of Man AHL, Man Numeric, Man GLG and Man FRM has over 20 years of investing experience, and Man Group developed its private markets offering with the launch of Man GPM in 2017.

2007 Return of Cash
On 24 July 2007 Man disposed of a majority interest in MF Global, by way of an initial public offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange, for net proceeds of US$2.75 billion. Following this disposal, shareholders approved a return of cash, on 23 November 2007, amounting to a sterling equivalent of US$1.40 per existing ordinary share.
On 26th November 2007, Man's ordinary shares of 3 US cents each ("Old Ordinary Shares") were consolidated into New Ordinary Shares of 3.4285 (3 and 3/7ths) US cents each ("New Ordinary Shares") in the ratio of seven New Ordinary Shares for every eight Old Ordinary Shares held. On the same date Shareholders were issued with one B Share or C Share for each Old Ordinary Share that they held at the Record Time.
In accordance with the terms of the Return of Cash, the Dividend Alternative and the Immediate Capital Alternative were effected in December 2007 and the Deferred Capital Alternative was effected in July 2008.
The Return of Cash may affect the tax position of shareholders. A general guide to the tax position of shareholders who are subject to tax in the UK can be found in the attached document ‘Tax information’. Further information on the Return of Cash can be found in the ‘Return of Cash Circular’. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position, or who are subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, should consult an appropriate advisor.

How can I buy or sell shares?

You can buy shares using any stockbroker or bank that offers a share dealing service in the UK, or in your country of residence if outside the UK. Man has arranged for a share dealing service to be available to purchase or sell Man Group plc shares, in the UK. The service is provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited and can be accessed via the Shareview website. For telephone dealing please call 03456 037 037 between 8.00am and 4.30pm Monday to Friday.

How will I receive shareholder documents?

Legislation has been introduced which enable companies to communicate with their shareholders by electronic means. Electronic communications (e-communications) enable the Company to communicate with our shareholders in a more timely, environmentally friendly and cost effective manner, which is in the interest of all shareholders. For these reasons the Company has decided to provide all relevant shareholder documents, including the mailing of the Annual Report and Notice of AGM, via the Company’s website, except where shareholders have requested a paper copy of the documents.
If you have signed up to receive e-communications via Equiniti’s Shareview website, you will receive an e-mail notification confirming that the documents are available on the Company’s website. If you would like to register on the Shareview site please have your shareholder reference number available, this can be found on your share certificate and dividend tax vouchers. If you have not registered for this service, we will send you a letter informing you that the documents are available from the website. You can continue to receive hard copies of Man’s communications by contacting Equiniti using the details above.

Why do I no longer receive a copy of the Interim Report?

As part of our electronic communications (e-communications) programme we have decided not to produce a printed copy of our Interim report. Instead the Interim Report will be published on our website and will be available from early November each year. If at that time you would like us to send a hard copy of our Interim Report, please e-mail us or telephone 020 7144 1000.

How can I contact the Company?

Different contacts within the organisation can be found on the contact page.

What should I do with my share certificate?

Share certificates are evidence of your ownership and should be kept in a safe place. You will need them if you want to sell all or some of your shares in the future. Share certificates are posted to shareholders at their own risk.

What is Capital Gains Tax?

Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit or gain you make when you sell or ‘dispose of’ an asset (e.g. shares). Please note that Man is unable to offer advice on capital gains tax and should you have any questions, or are unsure of your position, you should contact a duly authorised independent financial advisor.





Why have I received another share certificate?

Shareholders have been sent new share certificates following the completion of an internal restructure to insert a new holding company of the Group. Under the scheme of arrangement your existing shares (represented by a blue share certificate) were exchanged for shares in the new holding Company (represented by a white share certificate). The Man share certificates printed on blue paper with Company Number: 2921462 are no longer valid and should be destroyed. The share certificates printed on white paper with Company Number: 8172396 now represent your holding in Man and should be retained.

What is my shareholder reference number?

Your shareholder reference number is a unique 11-digit account number, which should be quoted when corresponding with Equiniti. The number is detailed at the top of your share certificate and on dividend tax vouchers.

Why do I receive multiple sets of documentation whenever you send anything to me?

If you have acquired shares in Man on more than one occasion, but the name and address you supplied to the Registrar differed, even slightly, from the existing details held, another account may have been created. If this happens and you want the accounts combined you should contact Equiniti.

How do I register my change of address?

If you have registered with Equiniti’s Shareview website, you can update your address details on-line. Alternatively you can complete the change of address form and return to Equiniti at the address shown on the form.

How do I register my change of name?

In order to register your change of name you will need to send Equiniti original documents confirming this change (eg your marriage certificate or change of name deed). Once the change has been processed, the original documents will be returned to you.

How do I transfer my shares to someone else?

If you hold a paper share certificate you can transfer your shares by completing a stock transfer form  and returning it to the Registrar.

What do I do if I lose my share certificate?

If your certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, you should contact the Company’s Registrar, Equiniti, as soon as you can. Equiniti will need to arrange for you to complete an indemnity covering the Company for any loss and you will be charged for this. Once this process is completed, Equiniti will send you a duplicate certificate.

How do I register the death of a shareholder?

Initially you should call Equiniti and notify them of the shareholders death. They will then add a notification of death restriction to the account. This will prevent future dividends being paid to the deceased shareholder.
If the shares were held solely in the name of the deceased, you should send Equiniti an official copy of the document by which the deceased’s legal personal representative was appointed, usually the grant of probate or letters of administration, impressed with the court seal. The name of the legal personal representative will be put on the register. The shares can then be sold by the personal representative, or transferred to the deceased’s beneficiary.
If the value of the deceased’s estate is below certain limits, the death can be registered using the small estates procedure. Details of the current limits and the procedure involved can be obtained from Equiniti.
If the shares were held jointly by the deceased and another person, a copy of the death certificate must be sent to Equiniti. The shares will then be registered in the name(s) of the surviving holder(s), and the relevant share certificates will be amended to reflect this.

How can I confirm the number of shares I hold?

If you have registered with Equiniti’s Shareview website, you can see this information on-line. Alternatively, you can contact Equiniti on 0371 384 2112, who will be able to confirm your shareholding.

How can I calculate the value of my shares?

Using the share price information provided above in the Share Price section you can calculate the value of your share holding, at both the purchase date and at present.

I hold certificates which quote Man Group plc Ordinary shares of 18 US cents each or Man Group plc Ordinary shares of 3 US cents each. Are these still valid?

No. Only share certificates relating to Man Group plc Ordinary shares of 3 3/7 US cents, issued on or after the latest consolidation on 26 November 2007 are valid.





What is an AGM?

AGM stands for Annual General Meeting, which the Company is required to hold every year and which every shareholder is invited to attend. The meeting reviews Man’s performance over the year and provides an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions and vote on key issues, such as the appointment of directors and the authority of the directors to issue shares. 

What is a General Meeting?

A General Meeting is a meeting of shareholders which is only held when it is necessary for shareholders to approve special business proposals which require approval before the next AGM.

How can I find out about the AGM?

Information on the Company’s AGM can be found in the Shareholder Meetings section of the Company’s website. This includes the Notice of Meeting and poll results (if the meeting has already occurred). 

What if I cannot attend the AGM?

If you cannot attend the AGM in person, you are still able to vote on the proposed resolutions and to ask questions on the business of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, if the shares are held in your own name, you will be sent details of how you can vote on the resolutions. Between the distribution of the Notice of the Meeting and the AGM, you can submit questions to the Board of directors by e-mail. Further information can be found can be found in the Shareholder Meetings section of the Company’s website.

What is a dividend?

A dividend is an amount, taken from the Company’s profits, paid out to shareholders for each share they hold.

How frequently are dividends paid?

Man generally pays dividends twice per year, following the announcement of the final and interim results. Any final or interim dividends are usually paid in July and December respectively.

Why do you declare your dividends in US dollars but pay them in sterling?

Man Group plc is a UK registered company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, however Man's functional currency is US dollars and therefore dividends are declared in US dollars, with an equivalent amount in Sterling payable to shareholders.

How do you set the exchange rate for dividend payments? 

The dividend exchange rate is set on the day prior to the announcement of the dividend.

Can I choose which currency I receive my dividends in?

Man only pays its dividends in Sterling. Shareholders based outside the UK, can ask Equiniti to arrange payments directly into their bank account, although there is a charge for this service. For further information please visit Equiniti’s website.

How are dividends paid?

Dividends are generally paid in cash and can be paid either by cheque, or directly into your bank or building society account. You can also choose to use your dividend to purchase further shares in the Company, by joining the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

What is a DRIP?

DRIP stands for Dividend Reinvestment Plan, which gives shareholders the opportunity to use their dividend to purchase further Man Group plc shares. Shareholders receive as many whole shares as can be bought with their dividend, taking into account any costs of the DRIP. Any residual monies left, after purchasing the shares out of your dividend payment, will be added to your next dividend payment.

How do I obtain the Company’s dividend history?

A full history of the dividends paid to shareholders can be found here.

What was the price of my DRIP shares?

You can find the price of your DRIP shares by looking at the Company’s dividend history.

What should I do if I have lost my dividend cheque?

If you have lost your dividend cheque you should contact Equiniti immediately, confirming that the payment has been lost. They will then arrange for the cheque to be stopped and issue you with a duplicate cheque. Please note that there may be a charge for this service.
To avoid any further loss, you may wish to consider arranging for the dividend to be paid directly into your bank account, which can be done by completing the dividend mandate form and returning it to Equiniti.

What should I do if I have lost my tax voucher?

If you lose a tax voucher you should contact Equiniti, confirming which tax voucher has been lost. A duplicate will be issued upon payment of an administration charge.





What are E-communications?

E-communications stands for electronic communications which enable us to communicate with you via e-mail and our website, rather than sending you printed documents. The service is run by Equiniti, through the Shareview website. You will need to have your shareholder reference number, which can be found on your share certificate or tax vouchers. The Shareview website enables you to:
Receive important shareholder communications by e-mail
Access details of your shareholding in Man
Change your details on-line, including postal address, e-mail address, mailing preference and dividend mandate

Why should I sign up for E-communications?

E-communications enables the Company to communicate with you in a more timely, secure and convenient manner; it also enables the Company to communicate in a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective way, which is in the interests of all shareholders.

What will I receive?

At the time of a shareholder mailing, you will receive an e-mail containing links to the Man website, where copies of the relevant documents can be downloaded. This includes the mailing of the annual report and Notice of AGM. 

How can I register to receive E-communications?

You will need to be registered with Equiniti’s Shareview website. In order to register for this service you will need your shareholder reference number, which can be found on your share certificate and dividend tax vouchers. Once registered, you will need to change your mailing preference to e-communications and provide your e-mail address.

Can I continue to receive hard copies of company documents?

Be aware!
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas ‘brokers’ who target shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares, generally in US or UK investments.
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and their activities have resulted in considerable losses for some investors. It is not just the novice investor that has been deceived in this way; many of the victims have been successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.


If you receive any unsolicited offers of investment advice:
Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation
Check that they are properly authorised (for example, in the UK by the Financial Conducts Authority) before getting involved
The Financial Conducts Authority also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the Financial Conducts Authority so that this list can be kept up to date and any other appropriate action can be considered. The Financial Conducts Authority can be contacted by completing an online form
If unsolicited calls persist, hang up
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be foundhere.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in company mailings.


Unsolicited mail
You may also receive unsolicited mail from a variety of commercial organisations who have obtained your address from our publicly available share register. If you wish to stop such mailings please contact:

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html
