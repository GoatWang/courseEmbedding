For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on six P&I classes, Classes A-1 through A-S, 
were affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's 
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service 
coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), 
are within acceptable ranges.




The rating on one IO class, Class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor 
or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.5% 
of the current balance compared to 5.3% at last review. 
Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 5.4% 
of the original pooled balance compared to 5.3% at last 
review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses 
for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Class X-A was 
"Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only Securities" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-GC29 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-GC29. 
Please see "Moody's Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only (IO) Securities", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, 
where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration 
has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including 
the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 21, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 10, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.6% to $1.112 
billion from $1.119 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 86 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 11% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 58% of the pool.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews 
the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect 
performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and no loans are currently 
in special servicing.




Moody's received full year 2015 financials for 80% of the pool 
and partial year 2016 operating results for 62% of the pool. 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 114%, the same as 
at last review and at securitization. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 9% to 
the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.7%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.71X and 0.94X 
compared to 1.75X and 0.93X, respectively, at 
last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the 
loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 30% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Selig Office Portfolio Loan ($125 million 
-- 11% of the pool), which represents a participation 
interest in a $345 million senior mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by nine office properties containing 1.6 million square 
feet (SF) of net rentable area (NRA), all located in Seattle, 
Washington. As of December 2016, the average occupancy rate 
across the collateral was 95.3% compared to 92.4% 
at last review. Larger tenants include Holland America, Washington 
State Ferries, and Emeritus Corporation. 1000 Second Avenue, 
the portfolio's largest building (27.5% of NRA), is 
located in Seattle's Financial District. The remaining eight buildings 
are located in Seattle's Lower Queen Anne/Lake Union and Denny Regrade 
Districts. The loan is interest-only for the entire ten-year 
term and matures in April 2025. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 
116% and 0.89X, respectively, the same as at 
last review.




The second largest loan is the 160 Fifth Avenue Loan ($110 million 
-- 10% of the pool), which is secured by a 
nine-story office building located at the southwest corner of Fifth 
Avenue and 21st Street in New York City. The building contains 
approximately 141,000 SF, of which 122,000 SF (86.5% 
of NRA) consists of office space on floors two through nine. The 
remaining 19,000 SF (13.5% of NRA) is represented 
by grade level and basement level retail space which is fully occupied 
by Club Monaco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ralph Lauren Corporation 
(A2 -- senior unsecured). The sponsor acquired the 
building in 2005 and subsequently completed extensive renovations from 
2007-2010. Since 2011, the property has been 100% 
leased to six tenants. The majority of the office space is leased 
to the Simons Foundation (47.7% of NRA). As of December 
2016 the property was 100% leased, the same as at last review. 
The mortgage borrower is also the borrower under $39 million of 
subordinate financing, including a $38 million subordinate 
loan and a $1 million equity investment (which bears fixed interest), 
both of which have a maturity date that is co-terminus with the 
maturity date of the mortgage loan. The loan is interest-only 
for the entire ten-year term and matures in April 2025. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 112% and 0.81X, 
respectively, compared to 113% and 0.8X at last review.




The third largest loan is the 3 Columbus Circle Loan ($100 million 
-- 9% of the pool), which represents a participation 
interest in a $350 million senior mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by a component of a 26-story, Class A, multi-tenant 
office building in New York City which was originally constructed in 1927 
to serve as headquarters for General Motors Corporation. The property 
collateral totals 526,000 SF and is comprised of 447,000 SF 
of office space, 76,000 SF of retail space and 3,000 
SF of other purpose space. From 2011 to 2013, the property 
underwent a large-scale renovation and modernization program. 
The reported cost of the renovation program was approximately $101.0 
million ($136/SF based on the total building area). The 
Property was 94% occupied as of September 2016 compared to 90% 
occupied at last review. The loan is interest-only for the 
entire ten-year term and matures in March 2025. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% and 0.79X, respectively, 
the same as at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.

Approximately $836 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, April 08, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on seven classes in 
Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-GC29 as follows:




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Apr 
15, 2015 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Apr

15, 2015 Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 (sf)


Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Apr 
15, 2015 Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The rating on the IO class was affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.3% 
of the current balance. Moody's base expected loss plus realized 
losses is now 5.3% of the original pooled balance. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 21, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 11, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.3% to $1.116 
billion from $1.119 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 86 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 11% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 57% of the pool.




Three loans, constituting 3% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and no loans are currently 
in special servicing.




Moody's received partial year 2015 operating results for 60% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 114%, 
the same as at securitization. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 10% 
to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.7%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.75X and 0.93X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 30% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Selig Office Portfolio Loan ($125 million 
-- 11% of the pool), which represents a participation 
interest in a $345 million senior mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by nine office properties containing 1.6 million square 
feet (SF) of net rentable area (NRA), all located in Seattle, 
Washington. As of December 2015, the average occupancy rate 
across the collateral was 92.4%, the same as at securitization. 
Larger tenants in occupancy include Holland America, Washington 
State Ferries, and Emeritus Corporation. 1000 Second Avenue, 
the portfolio's largest building (27.5% of NRA), 
is located in Seattle's Financial District. The remaining 
eight buildings are located in Seattle's Lower Queen Anne/Lake Union 
and Denny Regrade Districts. The loan is interest-only for 
the entire ten year term and matures in April 2025. Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 116% and 0.89X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is the 160 Fifth Avenue Loan ($110 million 
-- 10% of the pool), which is secured by a 
nine-story office building located at the southwest corner of Fifth 
Avenue and 21st Street in New York City. The building contains 
approximately 141,000 SF, of which 122,000 SF (86.5% 
of NRA) consists of office space on floors two through nine. The 
remaining 19,000 SF (13.5% of NRA) is represented 
by grade level and basement level retail space which is fully occupied 
by Club Monaco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ralph Lauren Corporation 
(A2 -- senior unsecured). The sponsor acquired the building 
in 2005 and subsequently completed extensive renovations from 2007-2010. 
Since 2011, the property has been 100% leased to six tenants. 
The majority of the office space is leased to the Simons Foundation (47.7% 
of NRA). As of September 2015 the property was 100% leased, 
the same as at securitization. The mortgage borrower is also the 
borrower under $39 million of subordinate financing, including 
a $38 million subordinate loan and a $1 million equity investment 
(which bears fixed interest), both of which have a maturity that 
is co-terminus with the maturity of the mortgage loan. The 
loan is interest-only for the entire ten year term and matures 
in April 2025. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% and 
0.80X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the 3 Columbus Circle Loan ($100 million 
-- 9% of the pool), which represents a participation 
interest in a $350 million senior mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by a component of a 26 story, Class A, multi-tenant 
office building in New York City which was originally constructed in 1927 
to serve as headquarters for General Motors Corporation. The property 
collateral totals 526,000 SF and is comprised of 447,000 SF 
of office space, 76,000 SF of retail space and 3,000 
SF of other purpose space. From 2011 to 2013, the property 
underwent a large-scale renovation and modernization program. 
The reported cost of the renovation program was approximately $101.0 
million ($136 PSF based on the total building area). The 
Property was 90% occupied as of September 2015 compared to 83% 
occupied at securitization. The loan is interest-only for 
the entire ten year term and matures in March 2025. Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 113% and 0.79X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's

Approximately $838.9 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, April 15, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned definitive ratings to 7 classes 
of CMBS securities, issued by Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 
2015-GC29 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates. 





Cl. A-1, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-AB, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. X-A*, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 (sf)


Cl. A-S**, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa1 
(sf)




*Reflects Interest-Only Class


**Reflects Exchangeable Certificates




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 86 fixed rate loans secured by 
108 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and the 
structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.73X is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.93X is in-line with the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X.




The pooled Trust loan balance of $1.119 billion represents 
a Moody's LTV ratio of 114.3%, which is higher 
than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6% 
but in line with the average of pools rated during 2015.




Moody's also considers subordinate financing outside of the Trust 
when assigning ratings. The 160 Fifth Avenue Loan (9.8 % 
of the pool balance) is structured with $38.0 million of 
subordinate debt and $1 million of preferred equity. Moody's 
LTV ratio for the pool, including aforementioned subordinate debt, 
is 119.4 %.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 21.0 (which is in lower 
than the scores calculated for most multi-borrower pools that Moody's 
has rated since 2009 and lower than most multi-borrower pools rated 
in 2015).




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl score is 26.9.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.15, which is stronger 
than indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions since 
2009 and stronger than most multi-borrower transactions rated in 
2015.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
U.S. and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in 
December 2014. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
14.5%, and 23%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated Aaa (sf) Super Senior class would be Aaa, 
Aa1, and Aa2, respectively; for the Aa1 (sf) rated class 
A-S would be Aa2, A1, and A3, respectively. 
Parameter Sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of 
the security might migrate over time; rather they are designed to 
provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change 
if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed. 
The analysis assumes that the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities 
only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF403282.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust Ser 2015-GC29 
      Commercial Mtg P-T Ctfs
    





March 26, 2015 12:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust Series 2015-GC29 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$29,302,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$146,427,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$334,415,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,822,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$838,892,000* class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,704,000* class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55,926,000b class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,704,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$180,362,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,732,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,713,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,713,000*a class X-D 'BBB-sf; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,769,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,185,000a class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (*) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Mar. 25, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $15,380,000a class G 
      and $39,148,505a class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 86 loans secured by 108 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.12 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were originated by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp.; Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company; Rialto 
      Mortgage Finance, LLC; KGS-Alpha Real Estate Capital Markets, LLC; GS 
      Commercial Real Estate LP; FCRE REL, LLC; and RAIT Funding, LLC. In 
      addition, one loan contributed to the trust was co-originated by 
      Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., German American Capital 
      Corporation, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 75.3% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 79.9%, and asset summary reviews of 86.0% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch- rated transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.17x is 
      below both the YTD 2015 average of 1.20x and the 2014 average of 1.19x, 
      and the pool's Fitch LTV of 111.2% is above both the YTD 2015 average of 
      109.3% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Concentrated Pool: The largest ten loans account for 57.2% of the pool 
      by balance. This is greater than the YTD 2015 average of 47.7% and the 
      2014 average of 50.5%. The pool's above-average concentration resulted 
      in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 476, which is greater than the 
      YTD 2015 and 2014 averages of 337 and 387, respectively. However, four 
      of the largest ten loans (29.1% of the pool) are secured by properties 
      located in New York City.
    

      Limited Hotel Exposure: Only 6.2% of the pool by balance consists of 
      hotel properties, which is below the YTD 2015 average of 17.8% and the 
      2014 average of 14.2%; hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.3% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which 
      historical NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during the most recent reporting period). Unanticipated further declines 
      in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the 
      certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      CGCMT 2015-GC29 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      slightly above average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a 
      scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. 
      In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' 
      could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of 
      additional stresses and sensitivities on pages 10 - 11.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC 
      Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' by Fitch. The special servicer 
      will also be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National 
      Association, rated 'CSS1' by Fitch.
