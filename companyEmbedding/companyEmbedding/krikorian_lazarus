Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain of the statements contained in this press release are
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934. These statements are based on management's current expectations
      and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. Among the
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
      projected, anticipated or implied are the following: changes in
      pharmaceutical market growth rates; the loss of one or more key customer
      or supplier relationships; changes in customer mix; customer
      delinquencies, defaults or insolvencies; supplier defaults or
      insolvencies; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing and
      distribution policies or practices; adverse resolution of any contract
      or other dispute with customers or suppliers; federal and state
      government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious
      orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled
      substances; qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud
      and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations
      governing the marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products or
      services and any related litigation, including shareholder derivative
      lawsuits; changes in federal and state legislation or regulatory action
      affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or reimbursement policies,
      including under Medicaid and Medicare; changes in regulatory or clinical
      medical guidelines and/or labeling for the pharmaceutical products we
      distribute, including certain anemia products; price inflation in
      branded pharmaceuticals and price deflation in generics; greater or less
      than anticipated benefit from launches of the generic versions of
      previously patented pharmaceutical products; significant breakdown or
      interruption of our information technology systems; our inability to
      continue to implement an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to
      handle business and financial processes and transactions (including
      processes and transactions relating to our customers and suppliers) of
      AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation operations as intended without
      functional problems, unanticipated delays and/or cost overruns; success
      of integration, restructuring or systems initiatives; interest rate and
      foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic, business,
      competitive and/or regulatory developments in Canada, the United Kingdom
      and elsewhere outside of the United States, including changes and/or
      potential changes in Canadian provincial legislation affecting
      pharmaceutical product pricing or service fees or regulatory action by
      provincial authorities in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing
      and service fees; the impact of divestitures or the acquisition of
      businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us
      to integrate or control; our inability to successfully complete any
      other transaction that we may wish to pursue from time to time; changes
      in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect our
      tax positions and/or our tax liabilities or adverse resolution of
      challenges to our tax positions; increased costs of maintaining, or
      reductions in our ability to maintain, adequate liquidity and financing
      sources; volatility and deterioration of the capital and credit markets;
      and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or
      operational factors affecting our business generally. Certain additional
      factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results
      to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements
      are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Company's Annual
      Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and
      elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company
      pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
