Target Sectors






Energy


Transport


Utilities

 
Basalt focuses on the North American and European mid market infrastructure sectors of utility, energy and transportation. Basalt is seeking low volatility assets that are either in the operational phase or in late stage construction projects that when complete exhibit traditional infrastructure characteristics. Basalt investments typically exhibit the following characteristics:
Low volatility; limited correlation with other asset classes

Operate on a largely uncorrelated cycle to other asset classes
Diversify even the most mature portfolio

Sustainable long-term, inflation-linked cash-flows

Predictable long-term cash flows; typically with government backed revenues or capacity based contracts
Stable, inflation linked revenues
Low market risk

High operating margins

Relatively low on-going variable operational and maintenance expenses

High barriers to entry

Large capital requirements limiting the number of natural competitors
Strong operational experience needed to successfully manage assets

Provision of essential services

Foundation for basic, irreplaceable public services, sometimes regulated
Benefit from relatively inelastic demand


































﻿






ESG | Basalt


































 Home / Esg
 






Basalt seeks to recognise ESG at all stages of the investment life-cycle (acquisition/management/disposal) and understand the impact that ESG has on the long term performance of portfolio investments. Basalt recognises that effective research, analysis and evaluation of ESG issues are fundamental for driving value and performance of investments over the medium and longer term.
