                                Report abuseTranscript of MOOSONEEComposition of the settlement of MoosoneePhysical Characteristics Sustainability, Livable communities, and CultureMOOSONEE, ONTARIO CGC1DMATTHEW FINKBEINERMRS.HUGHESMAP OF MOOSONEEMoosonee, OntarioMatthew FinkbeinerDec 9, 2014Courtesy of GooglePopulation & Urban Heiarchy.The population of Moosonee, Ontario as of 2014 was 3,500. This would place Moosonee, On the urban Hierarchy, as a Town. ( Village < , Town > ). The population of Moosonee is 85% Cree, with the First language being English and Cree as a Second language. Although there is a small french population within the town. locationSite:    The physical location of Moosonee is based upon the Hudson bay lowlands, and is just off of the Moose river. In a swampy inlet.Situation:    There were plentiful resources of which included animals and just natural wildlife. Settlements and Transportation found surrounding Moosonee are quite sparsely "spread out". However there are two settlements within relative proximity to Moosonee, which are Kashchewan and Moose factory island. Moose factory island can be reached by ferry and by ice road in the winter. Moosonee is not connected to any main roads within Ontario, and the only ways to reach Moosonee are by Train or Plane, making it a difficult destination to reach.Relative location:    The only relative locations to Moosonee are Kashchewan, and Moose Factory. Located in North Eastern Ontario.Absolute location:    The absolute location of Moosonee, Ontario is at (latitude) 51'16'23'''N (longitude) 80'38'24''WHistoryThe original inhabitants of Moosonee were of the Wood Cree nations, of Northern Ontario. They were attracted to Moosonee by the access to the mouth of the Moose river which leads into James bay. Also that they had the ability to trade with the James bay Cree.The original function of Moosonee, when the Wood Cree had "owned"the settlement, well was as a settlement for the Wood Cree acting as a Post as well as a Settlement. When the Europeans Took over the settlement in 1900 when Annie hardisty settled there. Settled as a trading post in 1903 by Revillon Freres company, to establish a Trading/Fur post with direct competition in mind with the Hudson Bay Co. Later bought out by HBC, the Revillon Freres Trading/ Fur post is still standing today. The settlements current function is to be a starting/launching point for anyone going further up north or to other destinations. Connected to the ice road in the winter to further people up north.VegetationThe Vegetation Region which Moosonee belongs to is the Boreal and Taiga forest.Since Moosonee is below the tree line there is plentiful amounts of coniferous trees in this area,such as Alders , Willows , Black spruce , Tamaracks. Coniferous forests are plentiful in this area due to the peat land.SoilMoosonee's soil region is "wet climate soils". Soil in Moosonee is composed of a Thin hummus layer and has an interesting Soil profile. The soil in Moosonee is rich in both Iron and Aluminum oxides, Due to the parent material of which is composed of Iron and Aluminum as well as Mafic Igneous Bedrock.WildlifeThe Wildlife in Moosonee is plentiful! There are so many magnificent creatures which live in northern Ontario, and some reside in Moosonee! Large mammals such as Caribou, Mule deer, Mountain goat, and of course Moose!Aviary Species: Canadian loon, many species of Hawks and Eagles, Heron, etcThere are to many animals to name as well as insects, so you could say there is a lot of wildlife in the north!ClimateThe Climate region where Moosonee is located is within the Taiga region. Moosonee has a Long winters some even lasting longer than 6 months, therefore receiving short summers.They receive an annual precipitation of about 682mm. Moosonee has a continental polar climate (cP) receiving this from James bay, Hudson's bay, And the Arctic itself.Moosonee has a Temperature range of 48.9 degrees Celsius , Making Moosonee have a "continental" climate.Landform and rock typesThe land form region of which Moosonee was settled upon was the Hudson bay- Arctic lowlands, One of the largest lowlands in all of the world. The rock types found in this region are sedimentary, created by all the sediments carried by the glaciers in the last ice age. The other rock type is ancient Igneous underneath the layers of sedimentary. The igneous is apart of the Canadian shield, one of the oldest landforms in all of the world.Natural ResourcesA)The primary Natural resource in Moosonee is Forests. In Northern Ontario, Softwood trees such as Spruce, Tamarack, Cedar, and Pine are abundant, Since they can survive in cold harsh climates. There are no significant natural resources in Moosonee other than Forests, because Moosonee sits in an area of which there are no Obtainable valuable metallic minerals, as well as an area not suitable for agriculture because of the harsh weather and soils.B)Moosonee's economic base is not dependent upon Forests as a natural source of revenue because of the transportation and milling of wood. The closest pulp and paper mill is in Timmins, But since there are means of transporting any wood, because there are no roads to Moosonee . Meaning to get the wood to a paper mill, The wood would have to be delivered by rail to Timmins which would be time consuming and costly. So in conclusion, Forests are not significant to the economic base of Moosonee.FAQ's: What is Moosonee's Primary Natural resource? How important is this resource to the Settlements economic base? - From industrial CompaniesWhat does Sustainability and livable communities mean?-Sustainability: Development of which meets the needs of the present without           affecting (negatively) future generations to meet their needs.-Livable Communities: The means of bringing common needs in an accessible manner, to the general public. Like say at distance from where they live, to the grocery store. To bring more culture to the community as well.How would you implement smart growth and sustainability in Moosonee?I would plead for the Town council of Moosonee to incorporate a smarter action plan for the people of Moosonee. To provide a larger industrial/ commercial industry in the community, to promise a stronger economy in the area, as well as easier and cheaper access to common needs for the  people of Moosonee. Such as a closer presence to a grocery store from a denser population district within the community.provide more access to the rest of Ontario with a main road to reach the town. Easier ,cheaper and less of a hassle to receive transported items. CultureThe culture in Moosonee may be perceivable as a community which is not diverse, but has a lot of incorporated culture in the town. Such as the Wood Cree nations. A cultural activity of which I recommend is visiting the Rail car "museum" on First street. This "museum" is only open in July and August, yet is quite the experience, considering this was one of the original ways to reach Moosonee by the rail cars in the "museum". Or visit the Tidewater provincial park, Ran by the municipality of Moosonee. The park is filled with wildlife and well, AdventureIN CONCLUSION     MOOSONEEMoosonee is an amazing town, of which it may be quaint, yet it gives you a small town feel in the great white North. Since the town is Secluded from the rest of Ontario it can only be reached by two different modes of transportation, giving you the adventurous feeling of a Secluded area. You also get the feeling of touching the edge of the arctic, which is cooler than you think! If you arrive in Moosonee during the winter you could travel farther up north to kashchewan or even farther! There are many beautiful places to visit such as Tidewater provincial park, one of Canada's most beautiful parks. Moosonee is a wonderful place, Come visit anytime!Full transcriptMore presentations by
