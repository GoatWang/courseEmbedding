Strategy - FC Advisors







































 













                Financial advice forevery step of the way            







The FC Model


                FC Advisors employs a balanced service model that pays equal attention to our clients' planning and investment management needs. Our client-centric philosophy means we offer a high level of customization, and view your plan and related investment strategies as individual and distinct.            





Financial Planning


Prudent, comprehensive financial planning depends on communication, a virtue FC Advisors holds in the highest esteem. Our client relationships are the foundation on which we plan life’s big financial decisions. Throughout this process, we’ll help you address questions you have and equip you with the questions you don’t yet know to ask.









Retirement Planning
Estate Planning
Tax Planning
Charitable Giving





If we get this part right, the rest falls into place. It begins with realistic projections with regards to income potential, expenses and savings. We address critical issues including, liability and risk exposure, college savings, stock option management, and business succession.


Many of our clients have reached a point in their careers and lives where the wealth they have generated has opened new opportunities, but also presented increasing complex challenges. As a team, including outside counsel, we’ll build the requisite structure to earmark your wealth in a fluid, tax-efficient manner.


One of our core objectives is to thoughtfully reduce our clients’ tax burden. We stay on the forefront of sensible and unique strategies that may include timed securities liquidation, the use of appropriate legal entities, gifting, and tax favored investments.


Many of our clients express philanthropy as a driving value. For these clients, FC Advisors can implement a broad array of strategies to ensure both long and short-term charitable objectives are met. Often, the means by which we address these objectives can also provide significant tax benefits.

Investment Management


                Unlike common industry practice, we shy away from blanket allocation models and catch-all approaches. We utilize sophisticated technology, in conjunction with the human elements of knowledge and discretion to develop easily adaptable, personalized models.            









Stocks, bonds, cash—how you invest your assets into these respective classes is one of the most important factors in optimizing returns. Asset allocation is based on your financial objectives as well as your tolerance for risk. The best financial strategy puts asset allocation at the forefront.


Once we’ve structured your portfolio, we’ll help you stick to it. Rebalancing to maintain your allocations, within a specific range, exists to help control risk and ensure the proportion of investments in a given asset class in line with how the portfolio was originally constructed.


We approach your portfolio with an expansive view. This requires the consideration of how different investments flourish or retract in the face of external forces such as, inflation, geopolitical climate, currency exchange rates and technological trends. It’s an imperative your portfolio address these pressures.


Warren Buffet said, “to be brave when others are fearful, and fearful when others are brave.” Opportunistic investment strategies capitalize on exactly this sentiment. FC Advisors constantly assesses undervalued securities, out-of-favor market sectors, and geo-political events that may create opportunity to invest at discounted valuations.


Mitigating your tax load is a two-fold strategy. When structuring your portfolio, we pay attention to the historical tax treatment of different asset classes. For instance, assets that commonly lend to higher taxes should most often be prioritized in tax-sheltered accounts. Additionally, when selling investments, we’ll keep an eye on capital losses and capital gains and do our best to efficiently offset.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

                    	Why FC Advisors?                    

                      As a boutique firm motivated by our client-relationships, we focus on you. Our collaborative model integrates a broad range of industry experts in areas including, asset management, estate planning, taxation, business succession and insurance. This depth of expertise, coupled with uncompromising values, allows us to provide a true, holistic, client-centric experience.                    


Advantage

                      How is it possible to choose the best counsel in an enormous pool of seemingly worthy candidates? The breadth of options can drown out what’s actually rare in this industry: financial counsel based on values. Open communication, goodwill, honesty, and personal dedication can’t be quantified. They are the makings of strong client relationships and ultimately differentiate FC Advisors from any other firm. This is authenticity that can't be replicated.                    






Process

                              The process of becoming an FC Advisors client relies on three steps.                            









1
Listen




It starts with a conversation. We’ll ask questions and listen. These questions are designed to help you articulate your goals, detail your current situations, and provide us perspective on your short and long-term goals.






2
Interpret




We use our initial conversations as a framework for subsequent interpretive discussion and further clarification of your objectives. Based on the revelations we’ve gleaned from this communication, we’ll interpret your immediate and long-term needs. Once we’ve come up with a proactive plan, we’ll walk you through the preliminary FC Advisors strategy and ensure that our plans align with your goals.






3
Act




Once we’ve ascertained a comprehensive picture of your current financial status and future objectives, we then prioritize a set of planning steps and begin the implementation process. We utilize sophisticated applications, combined insight and discernment, to customize a unique investment portfolio. Depending on the need, we also integrate additional partners/resources on your behalf. Our resource integration may also include collaboration with any existing legal, tax and financial counsel you maintain.
