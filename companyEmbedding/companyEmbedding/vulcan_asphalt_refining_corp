The nearly 340 workers clocked out after their final shifts at Carrier's gas furnace factory. Carrier announced in February 2016 that it would close the Indianapolis plant and cut about 1,400 production jobs in a move expected to save $65 million annually by moving furnace production to Mexico.Carrier plant layoffs begin in IndianaCNN MoneyThe airplane laptop ban is overAxios6,042Reactions.

That is, for all its digital leadership and ability to crank out new, more expensive drinks, Starbucks sales are on a long-term downtrend. Seeing as employee hourly wages and benefit costs are on the rise, as are costs to open new locations, a stubborn downtrend in sales is very unwelcome. It's especially unwelcome as most on Wall Street remain obsessed with Starbucks' growth prospects -- they could be in for some unfortunate surprises on the bottom line over the next year139Reactions.

John Flannery, a career GE executive, is set to take the CEO's chair on Aug. 1 from Jeffrey Immelt, whose popularity with investors waned as GE shares moved sideways in recent years.
