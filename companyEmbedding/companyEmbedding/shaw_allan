About Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Syndax is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing entinostat as a combination therapy in multiple cancer indications with an initial focus on tumors that have shown sensitivity to immunotherapy, including lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Entinostat is an oral, small molecule drug candidate that has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, potentially enhancing the body's immune response to tumors. Entinostat is being evaluated as a combination therapeutic in Phase 1b/2 clinical trials with Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, with Genentech, Inc. for TNBC, and with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer Inc. in ovarian cancer. Syndax is also developing entinostat as a combination therapeutic in a Phase 3 clinical trial that is being conducted with ECOG-ACRIN for advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
