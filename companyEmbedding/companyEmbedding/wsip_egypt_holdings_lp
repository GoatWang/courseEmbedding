Due to the electronic system's limitation of 10 Reporting Persons per joint filing, this statement is being filed in duplicate.

3. On May 12, 2016, EnLink MidStream Partners, LP (the "Issuer") issued to Enfield Holdings, L.P. ("Holdings") 992,445 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units (the "Series B Preferred Units") as payment for the quarterly distribution declared on the Series B Preferred Units.  The Series B Preferred Units are convertible into Common Units of the Issuer on a one-for-one basis (subject to certain adjustments) at any time from the business day following the record date established by the Issuer's general partner for the Issuer's quarterly distribution for the second quarter of 2017.

6.

7. The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein, if any, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that any such Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of, or has any pecuniary interests in, such securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or for any other purpose.

7. The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein, if any, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that any such Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of, or has any pecuniary interests in, such securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or for any other purpose.
