thereby became a subsidiary of the Company (the
“Merger”);
WHEREAS,
the Company wishes to employ the Executive, and the Executive
wishes to accept such employment on the terms set forth below,
effective May 22, 2007 (the “Effective Date”);
and
WHEREAS,
this agreement supersedes all previous agreements between the
Executive and Taberna, including the Prior Agreement:

Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. 
Term . The Company hereby employs the Executive, and the
Executive accepts such employment, for an initial term commencing
on the Effective Date and continuing for a three-year period
following such date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with
the provisions of Section 4 or Section 5; with such
employment to continue for successive one-year periods in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (subject to termination
as aforesaid) unless either party notifies the other party of
non-renewal in writing prior to three months before the expiration
of the initial term and each annual renewal, as applicable (the
period during which the Executive is employed hereunder being
hereinafter referred to as the “Term”).
2. 
Duties . During the Term, the Executive shall be employed by
the Company and its subsidiaries as Senior Vice President —
Finance and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company, reporting
directly to the Chief Financial Officer, and, as such, the
Executive shall faithfully perform for the Company the duties of
said offices and shall perform such other comparable duties of an
executive, managerial or administrative nature as shall be
specified and designated from time to time by the board of trustees
of the Company (the “Board”). The Executive shall
devote substantially all of his business time and effort to the
performance of his duties hereunder.
3. 
Compensation .
3.1
Salary . The Company shall pay the Executive during the Term
a salary at a minimum rate of $300,000 per annum (the “Annual
Salary”), in accordance with the customary payroll practices
of the Company applicable to senior executives. The Board
periodically shall review the Executive’s Annual Salary and
may provide for such increases therein as it may in its discretion
deem appropriate; provided that the Executive’s Annual Salary
shall be increased by no less than 10% per annum on each of the
first and second anniversaries of this Agreement. (Any such
increased salary shall constitute the “Annual Salary”
as of the time of the increase.)
3.2
Bonus . During the Term, in addition to the Annual Salary,
for each fiscal year of the Company ending during the Term, the
Executive shall have the opportunity to receive an annual bonus in
an amount and on such terms to be determined by the Company.
Nothing contained in the foregoing shall limit the
Executive’s eligibility to receive any other bonus under any
other bonus plan, stock option or equity–based plan, or other
policy or program of the Company.
3.3
Equity Compensation Plan . Executive shall be entitled to
otherwise participate in the Company’s 2005 Equity

during the Term to participate in any group life, hospitalization
or disability insurance plans, health programs, retirement plans,
401k plans, fringe benefit programs and other benefits that may be
available to other senior executives of the Company generally, in
each case to the extent that the Executive is eligible under the
terms of such plans or programs.
3.5
Vacation . The Executive shall be entitled to vacation of no
less than 20 business days per year, to be credited in accordance
with the Company’s policies.
3.6
Expenses-In General . The Company shall pay or reimburse the
Executive for all ordinary and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
actually incurred (and, in the case of reimbursement, paid) by the
Executive during the Term in the performance of the
Executive’s services under this Agreement, in accordance with
the Company’s policies regarding such reimbursements.
4. 
Termination upon Death or Disability . If the Executive dies
during the Term, the Term shall terminate as of the date of death,
and the obligations of the Company to or with respect to the
Executive shall terminate in their entirety upon such date except
as otherwise provided under this Section 4. If the Executive
is unable to perform substantially and continuously the duties
assigned to him due to a disability as defined for purposes of the
Company’s long-term disability plan then in effect, or, if no
such plan is in effect, by virtue of ill health or other disability
for more than 180 consecutive or non-consecutive days out of any
consecutive 12-month period, the Company shall have the right, to
the extent permitted by law, to terminate the employment of the
Executive upon notice in writing to the Executive. Upon termination
of employment due to death or disability, (i) the Executive
(or the Executive’s estate or beneficiaries in the case of
the death of the Executive) shall be entitled to receive any Annual
Salary and other benefits earned and accrued under this Agreement
prior to the date of termination (and reimbursement under this
Agreement for expenses incurred prior to the date of
termination);(ii) the Executive shall be entitled to receive an
amount equal to his Annual Salary for the remainder of the year in
which termination occurs; (iii)  without duplication of any
amounts due under clauses (i) and (ii), the Executive (or the
Executive’s estate or beneficiaries in the case of the death
of the Executive) shall receive an amount equal to the annual bonus
that, in the absence of such termination, would have been payable
for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, payable at such
time as would have applied in the absence of such termination, with
such amount to be multiplied by a fraction (x) the numerator
of which is the number of days in the fiscal year preceding the
termination and (y) the denominator of which is 365;
(iv) all outstanding unvested equity-based awards pursuant to
the Plan held by the Executive shall fully vest and become
immediately exercisable, as applicable, and subject to the terms of
such awards; and (v) the Executive (or the Executive’s
estate or beneficiaries in the case of the death of the Executive)
shall have no further rights to any other compensation or benefits
hereunder, or any other rights hereunder (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall receive such disability and death benefits as may be
provided under the Company’s plans and arrangements in
accordance with their terms).
5. 
Certain Terminations of Employment; Certain Benefits .
5.1
Termination by the Company for Cause; Termination by the
Executive without Good Reason .

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” shall
mean the Executive’s:


 
(i)
 
commission of, and indictment for or formal admission to a
felony, or any crime of moral turpitude, dishonesty, or breach of
the Company’s code of ethics, or any crime involving the
Company;




 
(ii)
 
engagement in fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement;




 
(iii)
 
continued gross insubordination
after written notice thereof by the Board;




 
(iv)
 
continued failure to materially adhere to the directions of the
Board, to adhere to the Company’s written policies and
practices or to devote a substantial majority of his business time
and efforts to the Company and its subsidiaries; or




 
(v)
 
material breach of any of the
provisions of Section 6.


provided that the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate the Executive for Cause except
on written notice given to the Executive at any time not more than
30 days following the occurrence of any of the events
described in clause (ii) through (v) above (or, if later,
the Company’s knowledge thereof). No termination for Cause
under clause (i) through (v) shall be effective unless
the Board makes a determination that Cause exists after notice to
the Executive, and the Executive has been provided with an
opportunity (with counsel of his choice) to contest the
determination at a meeting of the Board.

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement and the
Executive’s employment hereunder for Cause, and the Executive
may terminate his employment on at least 30 days’
written notice given to the Company. If the Company terminates the
Executive for Cause, or the Executive terminates his employment and
the termination by the Executive is not for Good Reason in
accordance with Section 5.2, (i) the Executive shall receive
Annual Salary and other benefits (including any bonus for a fiscal
year completed before termination and awarded but not yet paid, or
in the event of a partial fiscal year, a pro rata bonus earned
through the date of such termination, which is to be calculated
based on the bonus earned in the prior fiscal year) earned and
accrued under this Agreement prior to the termination of employment
(and reimbursement under this Agreement for expenses incurred prior
to the termination of employment); and (ii) the Executive
shall have no further rights to any other compensation or benefits
under this Agreement on or after the termination of employment.
5.2
Termination by the Company without Cause; Termination by the
Executive for Good Reason .

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason”
shall mean, unless otherwise consented to by the Executive,


 
(i)
 
the material reduction of the Executive’s title,
authority, duties and responsibilities or the assignment to the
Executive of duties materially inconsistent with the
Executive’s position or positions with the Company;




 
(ii)
 
a reduction in Annual Salary of the Executive; or




 
(iii)
 
the Company’s material and willful breach of this
Agreement.


Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) Good Reason shall not be deemed to exist unless
notice of termination on account thereof (specifying a termination
date no later than 30 days from the date of such notice) is
given no later than 30 days after the time at which the event
or condition purportedly giving rise to Good Reason first occurs or
arises and (ii) if there exists (without regard to this clause
(ii)) an event or condition that constitutes Good Reason, the
Company shall have 15 days from the date notice of such a
termination is given to cure such event or condition and, if the
Company does so, such event or condition shall not constitute Good
Reason hereunder.

(b) The Company may terminate the Executive’s employment
and the Executive may terminate the Executive’s employment
with the Company at any time for any reason or no reason. If the
Company terminates the Executive’s employment and the
termination is not covered by Section 4 or 5.1, or the
Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason or in the event
of non-renewal of this Agreement by the Company, as described in
Section 1:


 
(i)
 
the Executive shall receive a single-sum payment equal to
accrued but unpaid Annual Salary and other benefits (including any
bonus for a calendar year completed before termination) earned and
accrued under this Agreement prior to the termination of employment
(and reimbursement under this Agreement for expenses incurred prior
to the termination of employment);




 
(ii)
 
the Executive shall receive a single-sum payment of an amount
equal to the sum of (X) his Annual Salary (at the rate in
effect immediately prior to termination) plus (Y) the highest
bonus earned in the preceeding three year period prior to
termination, with such sum multiplied by 1.5; and




 
(iii)
 
all outstanding unvested equity-based awards (including without
limitation Options, Restricted Shares and phantom units) held by
the Executive shall fully vest and shall become immediately
exercisable, as applicable.


If payments due to
Executive are subject to the requirements of Prop. Treas. Reg.
§ 1.409A-3(g)(2) (or any successor provision), then
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (or any
otherwise applicable plan, policy, agreement or arrangement), such

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
