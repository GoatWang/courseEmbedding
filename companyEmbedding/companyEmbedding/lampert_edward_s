Early life and education[edit]
Lampert was born in 1962 to Dolores Lampert and Floyd M. Lampert. His mother was a housewife. His father was a senior partner in the law firm of Lampert & Lampert in New York City. He has a younger sister Tracey.[5] Lampert's grandmother was a passive investor and big fan of Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street Week television program. She instilled in him an interest in investing. His mother would later recall that young Eddie would sit with his grandmother reviewing and evaluating the performance of her stock picks in the daily newspaper.[2]
Lampert's father died at the age of 47 and his mother took a job as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue.[6] His mother would later say: "Eddie really assumed the responsibility, knowing that life had changed and we had to accomplish something by ourselves now."[2] In order to help support his family, Eddie worked after school and on weekends at various warehouses, stocking shelves and filling orders. Despite working, he earned good grades, played both soccer and basketball, and won the scholar athlete award at his high school. He received financial aid to help pay for college.[6] Lampert graduated from Yale University in 1984 (B.A., economics, summa cum laude), where he was a member of Skull and Bones[2][7] and Phi Beta Kappa.
Career[edit]
In July 1984, Lampert worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs, and then worked in the firm's risk arbitrage department from March 1985 to February 1988. While there, he worked directly with Robert Rubin. When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.
In April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name ESL derives from Lampert's initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.
Lampert typically holds his investments for several years and usually has between three and fifteen stocks in his portfolio. His investment style was once drawing comparisons to the financier Warren Buffett.[2]
Lampert's earnings in 2004 were estimated to be $1.02 billion, making him the first Wall Street financial manager to exceed an income of $1 billion in a single year.[8] In 2006, Lampert was featured on the Time 100 list for most influential people in the world for being one of the "brightest minds on Wall Street" and leading a new class of activist hedge funds.[9] Lampert was the richest person in Connecticut in 2006 with a net worth of $3.8 billion.[10]
Lampert's earnings in 2006 were estimated to be from $1.0 to $1.5 billion.
In March 2012, Lampert was No. 367 on the Forbes world wealthiest people list with a net worth of $3.1 billion.[11] By August, 2016, Lampert had fallen to No. 810 on the list, with a net worth of $2.2 billion.[1][12]
In January 2013, it was announced that Lampert would take over as chief executive officer at Sears after Louis D'Ambrosio stepped down due to family health matters, which took effect in May 2013.[13] In July 2016 he held 28% of shares in Sears Holdings Corp worth of approximately $408 million.[14]
Lampert is an avid follower of Ayn Rand[15] and has used elements of Rand's philosophy to guide his business decisions.[16]
In early 2017, Lampert, then president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holdings, was estimated to have personal assets of $2 billion, primarily in the hedge fund ESL Investments Inc.[17] Early in the year, he committed to providing an additional loan of $500 million to Sears and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling $200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.[18]
He has been strongly criticized by employees and corporate staff for "shredding" his employees in corporate meetings and "being out of touch with reality," as well as for failing to invest in the physical stores, as many of them are deteriorating. [19]
Personal life[edit]
In 2001, he married Kinga Lampert and they have three children.[1][2] They have homes in Indian Creek Village, Florida,[20] Aspen, Colorado,[21] and Greenwich, Connecticut.[22] The couple are active members of their local Chabad house.[23]
In 2003, Lampert was kidnapped from the parking lot of his Greenwich office, but was able to convince his captors to let him go after two days of captivity.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Lampert was born in 1962 to Dolores Lampert and Floyd M. Lampert. His mother was a housewife. His father was a senior partner in the law firm of Lampert & Lampert in New York City. He has a younger sister Tracey.[5] Lampert's grandmother was a passive investor and big fan of Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street Week television program. She instilled in him an interest in investing. His mother would later recall that young Eddie would sit with his grandmother reviewing and evaluating the performance of her stock picks in the daily newspaper.[2]
Lampert's father died at the age of 47 and his mother took a job as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue.[6] His mother would later say: "Eddie really assumed the responsibility, knowing that life had changed and we had to accomplish something by ourselves now."[2] In order to help support his family, Eddie worked after school and on weekends at various warehouses, stocking shelves and filling orders. Despite working, he earned good grades, played both soccer and basketball, and won the scholar athlete award at his high school. He received financial aid to help pay for college.[6] Lampert graduated from Yale University in 1984 (B.A., economics, summa cum laude), where he was a member of Skull and Bones[2][7] and Phi Beta Kappa.
Career[edit]
In July 1984, Lampert worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs, and then worked in the firm's risk arbitrage department from March 1985 to February 1988. While there, he worked directly with Robert Rubin. When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.
In April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name ESL derives from Lampert's initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.
Lampert typically holds his investments for several years and usually has between three and fifteen stocks in his portfolio. His investment style was once drawing comparisons to the financier Warren Buffett.[2]
Lampert's earnings in 2004 were estimated to be $1.02 billion, making him the first Wall Street financial manager to exceed an income of $1 billion in a single year.[8] In 2006, Lampert was featured on the Time 100 list for most influential people in the world for being one of the "brightest minds on Wall Street" and leading a new class of activist hedge funds.[9] Lampert was the richest person in Connecticut in 2006 with a net worth of $3.8 billion.[10]
Lampert's earnings in 2006 were estimated to be from $1.0 to $1.5 billion.
In March 2012, Lampert was No. 367 on the Forbes world wealthiest people list with a net worth of $3.1 billion.[11] By August, 2016, Lampert had fallen to No. 810 on the list, with a net worth of $2.2 billion.[1][12]
In January 2013, it was announced that Lampert would take over as chief executive officer at Sears after Louis D'Ambrosio stepped down due to family health matters, which took effect in May 2013.[13] In July 2016 he held 28% of shares in Sears Holdings Corp worth of approximately $408 million.[14]
Lampert is an avid follower of Ayn Rand[15] and has used elements of Rand's philosophy to guide his business decisions.[16]
In early 2017, Lampert, then president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holdings, was estimated to have personal assets of $2 billion, primarily in the hedge fund ESL Investments Inc.[17] Early in the year, he committed to providing an additional loan of $500 million to Sears and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling $200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.[18]
He has been strongly criticized by employees and corporate staff for "shredding" his employees in corporate meetings and "being out of touch with reality," as well as for failing to invest in the physical stores, as many of them are deteriorating. [19]
Personal life[edit]
In 2001, he married Kinga Lampert and they have three children.[1][2] They have homes in Indian Creek Village, Florida,[20] Aspen, Colorado,[21] and Greenwich, Connecticut.[22] The couple are active members of their local Chabad house.[23]
In 2003, Lampert was kidnapped from the parking lot of his Greenwich office, but was able to convince his captors to let him go after two days of captivity.[2]

Hedge funds have been failing over the last year at the fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2008. Some crashed and burned after sudden reversals. Others quietly liquidated.Then there’s Edward S. Lampert’s ESL Investments. It hasn’t failed, but may be setting a benchmark for slow, painful declines thanks to its outsize, long-term bet on two venerable retailers, Sears and Kmart.Last week, Sears Holdings, the parent company, said what was becoming increasingly obvious to most investors, not to mention anyone who’s been in a Sears store lately: “Substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”Sears said that the statement reflected a new, more stringent accounting rule, and that the company was in no imminent danger of bankruptcy. “We are a viable business that can meet its financial and other obligations for the foreseeable future,” said Jason Hollar, Sears’s chief financial officer.

Still, coming after seven straight years of huge losses, the announcement seems a milestone on a road that has only one likely end. Continue reading the main story

“It takes a retailer like Sears a long time to die,” said Greg Melich, senior managing director and head of consumer research for Evercore, and the last Wall Street analyst still covering Sears. “It’s been burning through over a billion dollars in cash every year. That’s not sustainable.”Sears Holdings has long been ESL’s largest investment, along with other Sears assets Mr. Lampert spun off, such as the struggling Lands’ End. (The two holdings accounted for nearly half the fund’s holdings at the end of the year, according to its most recent securities filings.) Sears Holdings shares were $162 in 2006; this week they were barely above $11.Few hedge fund managers have been as celebrated as Mr. Lampert in his heyday, which now appears to be the mid-2000s. Mr. Lampert was a Wall Street wunderkind, a Goldman Sachs intern whose intellect, ingratiating personality and prodigious work ethic attracted the patronage of some of America’s most prominent and successful investors: Robert Rubin, Mr. Lampert’s mentor at Goldman; Richard Rainwater, who invested for the billionaire Bass brothers before starting his own firm; and David Geffen, the billionaire entertainment mogul.Mr. Lampert was 25 years old and at the vanguard of the hedge fund movement when he founded ESL in 1988 with $28 million in seed money from Mr. Rainwater.

Just three years later, he was the subject of a front-page profile in The Wall Street Journal. He reaped even more publicity after he was kidnapped at gunpoint in 2003 and held hostage in a Days Inn before talking his way to freedom. By 2004, ESL’s spectacular 29 percent annualized returns landed him on the cover of Businessweek magazine.Besides Mr. Rainwater and Mr. Geffen, his high-profile investors included Michael Dell, members of the Ziff publishing family and Thomas J. Tisch, a philanthropist and heir to the Tisch family fortune. In 2006, Forbes ranked him No. 67 on its list of the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $3.8 billion, a few notches ahead of another retailing executive, Jeff Bezos of Amazon. He was widely hailed as another Warren Buffett, only perhaps even smarter. “Eddie is one of the extraordinary investors of our age, if not the most extraordinary,” Mr. Tisch told Businessweek.No one compares Mr. Lampert to Mr. Buffett anymore. His high-profile investors are, for the most part, long gone. Mr. Tisch, who’s also a director of Sears, is described as steadfastly loyal. Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert’s roommate at Yale and now Treasury secretary, disclosed last year that he had a $26 million investment in ESL. (Mr. Mnuchin said he would divest the position.)

Notably, a group of Goldman Sachs clients who had invested $3.5 billion in 2007 bailed out of the fund in 2013. Their exit “pretty much says it all” as far as investor confidence in Mr. Lampert goes, Mr. Melich said.Where did someone as smart, successful and hard-working as Mr. Lampert go wrong? His initial concept to combine two iconic but deeply distressed retailers — Kmart and Sears — initially appealed to many investors as a classic investment in undervalued, poorly managed assets in the Warren Buffett style. But Mr. Buffett doesn’t personally manage his portfolio companies. Several former Lampert investors told me that Mr. Lampert’s fundamental mistake was one common to many once-successful hedge fund managers: hubris, and the belief that investment prowess would translate into management skill.“He was a very successful investor before he took over Kmart and Sears,” said Mark Cohen, former chief executive of Sears Canada and a professor at Columbia Business School, where he’s the director of retail studies. (Mr. Cohen left Sears Canada before Mr. Lampert arrived.)“He seemed to think he was smarter than anyone in the retail business, but he had no idea how to run the company from Day 1,” Mr. Cohen said. “One thing I teach is that core competencies are the basis for success or failure. Lampert had no experience in retail, and no management competency whatsoever.”

Sears and other brick-and-mortar retail chains, of course, have been battered over the last decade by forces beyond Mr. Lampert’s control, especially the rise of internet retailing. Mr. Lampert claims to have foreseen the trend. If so, he’s had scant success carrying out a strategy to deal with it.His one consistent approach over the years has been to cut costs drastically. Initially, it seemed to work, increasing cash flow and earnings. “There’s a philosophy to that,” Mr. Melich said, but Sears “grossly underinvested in areas that proved to be very relevant to the future of merchandising, such as multichannel retailing.”He pointed to the contrast between Sears and Home Depot, whose shares have nearly tripled in the last five years, despite the internet and competition from Amazon.

Mr. Lampert has shown more prowess as a financial engineer, and has seemingly squeezed Sears’s once formidable assets for every penny of value through a continuing series of asset sales, spinoffs, dividend payouts and loans secured by Sears assets. Mr. Lampert has emphasized that because he is Sears’s largest shareholder, his interests are aligned with other Sears shareholders.But the perception persists that many of these deals have benefited Mr. Lampert more than shareholders, since he’s often on both sides of the transactions.

Over the last two years alone, Mr. Lampert and ESL have extended Sears over $800 million in loans secured by Sears assets — nearly two-thirds as much as Sears’s entire market capitalization of $1.2 billion. That makes Mr. Lampert and ESL the largest Sears creditors, giving them vastly different interests than most shareholders. (ESL Investments holds 48 percent of Sears Holdings’s equity and 32 percent of its total long-term debt.) As creditors, they could end up owning Sears if it reorganizes in bankruptcy, while other Sears shareholders would be wiped out.Last month, Mr. Lampert and the Sears board agreed to pay $40 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming that Sears’s sale and lease-back of much of its most valuable real estate to a real estate investment trust — 43 percent owned by Mr. Lampert and his ESL hedge fund — was a blatant conflict of interest that harmed Sears shareholders. Sears has denied any wrongdoing and said it had settled the suit merely to avoid “protracted litigation.”Mr. Lampert “has stripped Sears of its assets,” Mr. Cohen said. “It’s the longest liquidation in retail history. His reputation in the retail community is that he’s a financial pirate.”Like most hedge fund managers, Mr. Lampert continues to get a management fee no matter how poorly the fund’s assets perform.Still, Sears’s travails and their impact on ESL’s results have clearly taken a toll on Mr. Lampert’s own fortunes. Although Mr. Lampert probably shows substantial gains on his original investment in Sears and Kmart, “he and ESL investors can’t have fared very well over the past six or seven years,” Mr. Melich said.Mr. Lampert remains one of the country’s richest people. He owns lavish homes in Greenwich, Conn.; Aspen, Colo.; and Miami as well as a 288-foot yacht, Fountainhead, named after the Ayn Rand novel (Mr. Lampert is a devotee of the author). Last year Forbes ranked him tied for No. 309 on its annual list of the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $2.3 billion.But that’s a billion-and-a-half dollars less than Forbes estimated back in 2006. Since then, Mr. Bezos has vaulted to No. 2 on the Forbes list, just behind Bill Gates, with a net worth of $67 billion. Had Mr. Lampert simply put his fortune in a stock market index fund rather than gaining control of Sears and Kmart, he would have fared far better.Through a spokesman, Mr. Lampert declined to comment.Even his critics concede that Mr. Lampert has been stubbornly consistent, refusing to throw in the towel on Sears even after years of deteriorating results. In a news release last week, he showed no signs of backing down, pledging yet another “fundamental restructuring” of Sears.His strategy? Cutting “at least $1 billion in costs on an annualized basis.”

 Correction: March 30, 2017  
An earlier version of this column misstated the management fee charged by ESL Investments. The fund says it is 1 percent of assets under management, not 2 percent.

The majority of Lampert's wealth stems from his investments in retailers over the past decade, most notably Sears Holdings and several Sears-affiliated spinoffs, including Sears Canada, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, Lands' End and Seritage Growth Properties. He also owns about 11 percent of AutoNation. Positions are taken from the latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings that disclose ownership of Lampert and his hedge funds. This analysis excludes shares owned by other investors through Lampert's funds.
The billionaire loaned $321 million to Sears Holding in January 2017. Past loans have left Lampert with 6.3 million warrants accepted in lieu of interest payments. These warrants are exercisable at $28.41 each and aren't counted in this analysis because they are underwater.
Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, manages about $2.8 billion in assets, according to a Form ADV filed with the SEC in March 2016 that also indicated he owns all of the firm and has $400 million of his own money in the funds.
ESL itself is valued by the price-to-asset under management ratio of publicly traded hedge funds Och-Ziff and Man Group. His personal $400 million in funds held in ESL are excluded from its AUM for the peer-group calculation and represented as a separate asset.
Lampert has more than $2 billion in other assets, the majority of which stems from sales of AutoNation stock since 2009. This analysis asserts he sold out of his last disclosed holdings of the retailer by 2015, about two years after fell below beneficial reporting requirements. Taxes, dividends, market performance and more than $1.3 billion in stock sales and purchases in other retailer stocks are also tabulated to adjust this cash figure.
Representatives for Lampert didn't return phone calls seeking comment.







Biography

Birthdate: 7/19/1962
Family: Married, 3 children
Education: 
            
            Economics, Yale University, Bachelor's Degree
          
          


Edward S. Lampert was born July 19, 1962, the son of Floyd Lampert of the law firm of Lampert & Lampert, and Dolores, a homemaker. Growing up in the suburb of Roslyn on New York's Long Island, he watched Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street Week with his grandmother, a dividend investor. His father died of a heart attack when Lampert was 14 years old. 
Lampert, his mother, and his sister Tracey, struggled. In high school, he worked at a warehouse, and read financial reports at night. He received a degree in economics from Yale University and landed a job at Goldman Sachs in 1984, working in risk arbitrage under fixed-income chief Robert Rubin. Four years later, he left to start ESL under the tutelage of investor Richard Rainwater.
Lampert left after 18 months. A value investor, he began buying aircraft lessor PS Group in 1993. As the company ran into financial problems, he pushed for asset sales and dividends, doubling ESL's money. ESL bought IBM in 1995, when CEO Louis Gerstner took charge and realized that investors were focused on the company' PCs and mainframes, not the lucrative service business. Lampert had quadrupled his money by 1999. 
Investors noticed, including Thomas Tisch, David Geffen and the Ziff family, all of whom invested with ESL. Assets peaked at $15 billion by 2007. Lampert moved into unglamorous retail niches, including auto parts chain AutoZone and car dealer AutoNation. He bought big positions without using leverage. He often agitated for change, pushing out the management at AutoZone.
Lampert was kidnapped in January 2003, persuading his captors into freeing him days later. Later that year, ESL gained control of Kmart, purchasing $1 billion of debt of the ailing discount chain for as little as 20 cents on the dollar. When it emerged from bankruptcy in May 2003, ESL was the largest shareholder. He sold stores, cut capital expenditures, inventories and promotions. The stock soared and, in November 2004, Kmart announced plans to buy Sears Holdings for $11 billion. A Businessweek cover story asked whether Lampert was the next Warren Buffett.
 
The combined company, Sears, rallied. The shares peaked in early 2007, and then began a decline that lasted for seven years. The company's market capitalization dropped to $6.2 billion in 2013 from $27.3 billion in 2007. Analysts criticized Lampert for not spending enough on upkeep and for shuttering stores. In 2012, Lampert moved to Florida leaving most of ESL's staff in Connecticut. He assumed the Sears' CEO post in February 2013, the fifth person to hold that post since his takeover.
Lampert and his wife, Kinga, contributed $100,000 in 2011 to American Friends of UHN, which funds Toronto's University Health Network. In 2010, they donated $75,000 to the NYU Heart Rhythm Center and $125,000 to the Minneapolis Heart Institute.


Milestones
1962 Born on New York's Long Island, to lawyer Floyd and Dolores Lampert.

The big missteps that brought an American retail icon to the edge of collapse

Walk into a Sears these days, and you’ll see an icon of American retailing collapsing before your eyes.
On a May visit to the Falls Church, Virginia, store, the floors in the refrigerator aisles were splotched with brown stains. Over by the exercise equipment, the walls were scuffed and had wires hanging out of them. There were empty shelves in the shoe department. And in the tools section. And the men’s clothing area.
The place is in decay — much like Sears’s once-dominant business model.
After six straight years of plunging sales and profit losses, the company is shuttering stores and selling off crown jewels like its Craftsman tools line.
Decades of missed opportunities have brought Sears to this. It lost its focus with ventures into Discover credit cards and Coldwell Banker real estate in an attempt to diversify. Then big boxes such as Home Depot and Best Buy chipped away at lucrative product niches. But maybe the biggest whiff: Executives knew as far back as the early 1990s that they had to wean Sears off its dependency on shopping malls — but its many forays into other store formats never quite worked.




As e-commerce moves toward its golden age, Sears is an also-ran.
Sears Holdings’ stock price peaked in 2007 at $195.18, when it was an empire with more lines of business. Friday, its stock closed at $6.95.  Amazon.com, meanwhile, cleared $1,000 a share last week. (Jeffrey Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, who graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High as valedictorian in 1982 and won a Silver Knight award, owns The Washington Post.)
Other data, too, show a company in retreat. In 2006, it had 355,000 employees; today, it has 140,000.  This year alone it announced the closing of 265 Sears and K-Mart stores; none is in South Florida. Last week,  its Canadian spinoff filed for bankruptcy protection.
In this war of attrition, chief executive, Indian Creek Village’s  Edward S. Lampert, has said, “We’re fighting like hell.” Lampert, a controversial hedge fund billionaire, has invested heavily in bolstering Sears’s Internet business but has let the retail stores languish. He’s now propping up the company with loans and other feats of financial engineering — moves that may soften his landing if the chain fails.
The trouble at Sears “represents the loss of this long arc of retail history,” said Vicki Howard, a historian at University of Essex in Britain, who has written a book about department stores. “It does seem quite dire. It does seem like we’re at some kind of turning point.”
















                        An employee prepares to lock up for the night at the Sears on Leesburg Pike in Falls Church, Virginia.

Sears is hardly alone. Retailers have announced the closures of more than 2,000 stores this year alone. Big retail is on pace to see more bankruptcies in 2017 than in any year since the Great Recession, according to research by the consultancy AlixPartners.
“The past year will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for ‘brick and mortar’ retailers — and our company was one of the many affected by these headwinds,” Lampert wrote in a blog post in May.
Lampert has acknowledged that vendors are getting nervous about doing business with Sears. In May, the retailer filed a lawsuit against a tool supplier that it believes is “trying to take advantage of negative rumors” to get out of a contract.

Sears and South Florida keep a close relationship








Sears dismisses the idea that it has run out of options. The company says it is confident in its financial position and is pushing forward with a turnaround plan, even as it acknowledged in a March regulatory filing that there is “substantial doubt” as to whether it can survive.
“The folks who are playing taps at our funeral, we’re not in the box,” said Chris Brathwaite, a company spokesman.
COMPANY’S ROOTS 
Sears, in many ways, created the blueprint for shopping as we know it.
Sears Roebuck & Co. began in the 19th century as a mail-order business for selling watches and quickly grew into a catalog that sold saddles, sewing machines and buggies to a largely rural nation. The prices were low and the selection was vast — a model made possible as the ramp-up of mass production was making it cheaper and quicker than ever to churn out goods.

Macy & Co. already had flourishing catalog businesses by the time Richard Sears got in the game, but he quickly found an audience thanks to his flair for cooking up promotions that shoppers went wild for. (Sometimes, they were too good to be true: The 1895 Sears, Roebuck catalog promised a men’s suit for $4.98, saying it was an “unheard of price” for its quality. The deluge of interest left Sears’s merchants scrambling unsuccessfully to find enough suits to fill the orders.)
Where America went, Sears followed: As consumers migrated into urban and later suburban areas, Sears swooped in and built an empire of department stores.
Sears, in many ways, created the blueprint for shopping as we know it.
In 1925, a visionary executive named Robert E. Wood pushed the company to open its first outpost. Wood gambled that these emporiums would appeal to consumers who were discovering the new mobility that came with the automobile.
Within four years, Sears had 324 stores, and it could hardly open them fast enough. By 1931, store purchases accounted for a bigger share of its sales than the catalog did.
Sears became the country’s largest, most powerful retailer. Generations of shoppers outfitted their homes with its Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances. They dragged their children there to buy back-to-school clothes and First Communion outfits. Those kids built their Christmas lists by paging through its holiday Wish Book.
For a time, Sears sold cars. It even sold houses. If shopping in America had a collective consciousness, Sears was its centerpiece. By the 1970s, 1 out of every 204 working Americans was employed by Sears. It was pumping out 315 million catalogs a year, making it America’s largest publisher.
“Sears was regarded as a national institution, almost like the Post Office,” said Gordon L. Weil, a writer who chronicled the history of Sears in a 1977 book. “Everybody went there, everybody did business with them. Everybody believed they were a permanent part of the landscape.”
Jim Hicks, a retiree living in Atlanta, was one of those loyal customers. The 74-year-old remembers that his dad took him to Sears in 1967 to buy two new suits, a gesture of kindness when money was tight for him as a seminary student.
About 25 years ago, he had Sears technicians install a Kenmore washer and dryer in his home.
“They’re still working,” Hicks said. “And no one’s done a lick of work to them.”
And then there was the Sears tools department, where Hicks said he was “like a kid in the candy store.” A hand-powered drill he bought there helped him build the 14 1/2-foot rowboat that he took on countless fishing excursions to Georgia lakes and marshes.
His soldering gun, his saw, his ratchet wrench: They all come from Sears.
PORTFOLIO BROADENS 
By the early 1990s, the portfolio of Sears had grown to include Discover, Coldwell Banker and stock brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds, financial services businesses that it hoped would provide more diverse revenue streams. But ultimately, they became distractions from the core retailing business.
When Sears posted a loss of nearly $4 billion in 1992, investors began worrying about its durability.
Steven Kirn recalled what it was like when he joined the company a year later as a senior human-resources executive and spent time traveling the country to visit Sears stores to get a feel for the business.
“The morale was so low,” Kirn said. When store employees went on break and ventured out to the mall food court, “they would take off their Sears name tag so no one would know where they were from. That’s pretty grim.”
And then came those “softer side of Sears” commercials.
The ads had an earworm of a jingle and featured fashionistas ambling along the beach in a cozy coat or twirling in a sparkly cocktail dress. The message was clear: Sears is not just a place to stock a toolbox.
The campaign was part of a broader turnaround strategy hatched by Arthur Martinez, an executive who took the helm of the Sears retail division in late 1992. His idea was simple: Women were the primary shopping decision-makers in most American households, and Sears was not doing enough to win them over.
Martinez made other key moves to nurse Sears back to health: He axed the catalog, which by then was losing more than $100 million a year. The company sold off its gleaming Sears Tower headquarters in Chicago and those distracting financial services businesses. (It also parted ways with Allstate, the insurance provider that it had created back in 1931.)
It was a shot in the arm, but it only lasted so long.
Martinez began steering Sears to focus on new retailing formats that were aimed at reducing the store’s dependency on shopping malls, including Sears Hardware stores, Orchard Supply Hardware Stores and the Great Indoors. But none of those provided salvation — and in some cases, just created new competition for its existing department stores. Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores was spun off as a separate public company in 2012.













                        A sign giving information on a sale is displayed at a Sears location in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on Thursday, June 22.

Steve Dennis, a former Sears executive who worked on its deals strategies in the 1990s, said the company studied whether it could buy its way to success by scooping up a home improvement big-box store. He said they looked at buying Builder’s Square, but ultimately concluded they were late to what was already a “two-horse game” between Home Depot and Lowe’s.
“There are plenty of examples along the way where Sears just missed some pretty profound changes,” Dennis said. “Unfortunately, I think for the most part, the die was cast by the mid-’90s.”
A NEW BRAND 
After Martinez retired in 2000, chief executive Alan Lacy pushed forward with the idea to wean Sears off the suburban shopping mall by creating a brand called Sears Grand, a concept that was something of a hybrid between a department store and Walmart.
But at a pace of 10 to 20 Sears Grand stores a year, it was too little, too late.
By 2004, it was hedge fund chief Lampert’s turn to try to revive the chain. He engineered a takeover of Sears by Kmart, another troubled retailer. At the time, the deal had the media asking whether Lampert might be the next Warren Buffett, a genius investor who could resurrect the venerable chain by turning it into a powerful conglomerate.
Lampert undertook a number of initiatives, including Shop Your Way, a rewards program in which shoppers earn points by spending money at Sears, Kmart and tens of thousands of partner businesses. Its goal is to turn Sears into a more membership-centric retailer; the company says the program has “tens of millions of active members" and that nearly three-quarters of its business is driven by it.
Lampert also slashed costs and put more resources toward building Sears’s online shopping firepower.
But even so, that is another area that the retailer has struggled to get right. A former e-commerce executive recalled that from 2006 to 2008, the Sears and Kmart websites went down for hours at a time on Black Friday and Cyber Monday — and they just expected those kinds of outages on the biggest shopping days of the year.













                        Sears at 3655 SW 22nd St., Coral Gables, early Thursday. Sears is closing its Aventura store in mid-July. In the main, Florida so far has escaped the growing loss of traditional retail jobs nationwide. “In South Florida, shopping is a part of the tourism experience,” Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida economist, told the Sun-Sentinel in May.

                                cmguerrero@elnuevoherald.com
                            



 
Some critics say Lampert just does not have a merchant’s instinct. One former senior executive, for example, remembers being puzzled when Lampert wanted to start selling appliances in Kmart stores. Customer research showed that most Kmart shoppers were renters, not homeowners. So why would they spring for ovens and refrigerators?
Lampert’s tenure has seen a revolving door at the highest levels of management. Several former Sears executives say that stores have suffered because Lampert did not pour more money into their maintenance or growth. Lampert himself has lamented the sluggish progress.
“If we were making a meaningful amount of money, it would enable us to move much faster in our transformation,” Lampert said in a recent interview with the Chicago Tribune.
LAMPERT’S ROLE 
Amid Sears’s recent spate of troubles, Lampert has thrown the company several lifelines.
A real estate investment trust he chairs, Seritage Growth Properties, paid $2.7 billion in 2015 to acquire more than 200 stores and other real estate owned by Sears Holdings. The deal gave Sears a fresh infusion of cash, and the retailer entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement that allowed it to continue operating stores in those locations.
Sears was regarded as a national institution, almost like the Post Office. Everybody went there, everybody did business with them. Everybody believed they were a permanent part of the landscape. Gordon L. Weil, who chronicled the history of Sears in a 1977 book. 
In addition, Lampert’s hedge fund, ESL Investments, has provided loans to Sears Holdings, including one for $500 million announced earlier this year.
So in addition to being the chief executive and major shareholder of Sears, Lampert is also effectively a major creditor. And that means that he may have found a way to lessen his financial pain should the company go into bankruptcy — even as jobs disappear and stores close.
“I’ve never seen a company that was financed like this, and I’ve looked at the capital structure of thousands of companies,” said Jared Ellias, a professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law who studies corporate bankruptcies.
As of March 13, Lampert controlled about 59 percent of shares of Sears Holdings. Experts say that, if the company were to file for bankruptcy, those shares, as well as those of other shareholders, would probably be wiped out.
However, experts say ESL could be buffered by the fact that it is a secured creditor of Sears, the type that typically fares better in a bankruptcy proceeding.
But it might not turn out to be that simple: Fellow creditors could bring up issues in bankruptcy proceedings that could undermine Lampert’s ultimate financial standing.
IN SEARCH OF PROFITS 
It is possible that those financial scenarios never come to pass as Sears works through its transformation plan, which includes making the Shop Your Way program even more valuable to members. Lampert has blamed the media for much of the negativity surrounding the company.
“People are shopping us to the tune of $20 billion in revenue,” said Brathwaite, the Sears spokesman. “Clearly we mean something to a lot of people. And so what we’re trying to do is make ourselves profitable.”
The retailer still has a substantial market share in the appliances category, trailing only Lowe’s and Home Depot. Technicians in its home services business make some 7 million service calls a year, offering an opportunity to establish and deepen customer relationships.
There are plenty of examples along the way where Sears just missed some pretty profound changes. Unfortunately, I think for the most part, the die was cast by the mid-’90s. Steve Dennis, a former Sears executive who worked on its deals strategies in the 1990s.
When asked about the condition of the store in Falls Church, a spokesman said they are working to spiff up the store in the hope that business picks up there.
“Because of Sears and Kmart’s long-standing history and cultural impact, we are targeted for criticism when our results are poor,” Lampert said in a 2016 letter to shareholders. “But it is unfair to evaluate our approach through the rearview mirror without acknowledging the changing circumstances in our industry as well as our bold attempts to change the way we do business to meet this changing reality.”
But others are not so sure. The Chicago Tribune has reported that by early September, Sears will close 49 K mart and 17 Sears stores, according to a source close to the company, after shuttering 150 in the first quarter of this year.
“You’re not going to be able to reverse Sears. I’m not sure there’s much left to reverse,” said Michael Lisicky, an author who has chronicled the history of department stores.
Kirn, now a professor at the University of Florida, said he recently asked his students whether they have shopped at Sears in the past year. Zero hands went up.
“They don’t have any sense of identification with Sears at all,” Kirn said.
Miami Herald staff contributed to this report. Information from The Chicago Tribune was also used. 






















The location of the Sears store on Biscayne Boulevard and Northeast 13th Street was significant in developing a retail district north of downtown Miami. Built on Nov. 14, 1929, the store was one of the area’s first Art Deco buildings, predating the Art Deco hotels on Ocean Drive by almost six years. It was designed by Nimmons, Carr and Wright of Chicago. Now, only its tower remains, preserved and incorporated into the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.

Early life and education[edit]
Lampert was born in 1962 to Dolores Lampert and Floyd M. Lampert. His mother was a housewife. His father was a senior partner in the law firm of Lampert & Lampert in New York City. He has a younger sister Tracey.[5] Lampert's grandmother was a passive investor and big fan of Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street Week television program. She instilled in him an interest in investing. His mother would later recall that young Eddie would sit with his grandmother reviewing and evaluating the performance of her stock picks in the daily newspaper.[2]
Lampert's father died at the age of 47 and his mother took a job as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue.[6] His mother would later say: "Eddie really assumed the responsibility, knowing that life had changed and we had to accomplish something by ourselves now."[2] In order to help support his family, Eddie worked after school and on weekends at various warehouses, stocking shelves and filling orders. Despite working, he earned good grades, played both soccer and basketball, and won the scholar athlete award at his high school. He received financial aid to help pay for college.[6] Lampert graduated from Yale University in 1984 (B.A., economics, summa cum laude), where he was a member of Skull and Bones[2][7] and Phi Beta Kappa.
Career[edit]
In July 1984, Lampert worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs, and then worked in the firm's risk arbitrage department from March 1985 to February 1988. While there, he worked directly with Robert Rubin. When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.
In April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name ESL derives from Lampert's initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.
Lampert typically holds his investments for several years and usually has between three and fifteen stocks in his portfolio. His investment style was once drawing comparisons to the financier Warren Buffett.[2]
Lampert's earnings in 2004 were estimated to be $1.02 billion, making him the first Wall Street financial manager to exceed an income of $1 billion in a single year.[8] In 2006, Lampert was featured on the Time 100 list for most influential people in the world for being one of the "brightest minds on Wall Street" and leading a new class of activist hedge funds.[9] Lampert was the richest person in Connecticut in 2006 with a net worth of $3.8 billion.[10]
Lampert's earnings in 2006 were estimated to be from $1.0 to $1.5 billion.
In March 2012, Lampert was No. 367 on the Forbes world wealthiest people list with a net worth of $3.1 billion.[11] By August, 2016, Lampert had fallen to No. 810 on the list, with a net worth of $2.2 billion.[1][12]
In January 2013, it was announced that Lampert would take over as chief executive officer at Sears after Louis D'Ambrosio stepped down due to family health matters, which took effect in May 2013.[13] In July 2016 he held 28% of shares in Sears Holdings Corp worth of approximately $408 million.[14]
Lampert is an avid follower of Ayn Rand[15] and has used elements of Rand's philosophy to guide his business decisions.[16]
In early 2017, Lampert, then president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holdings, was estimated to have personal assets of $2 billion, primarily in the hedge fund ESL Investments Inc.[17] Early in the year, he committed to providing an additional loan of $500 million to Sears and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling $200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.[18]
He has been strongly criticized by employees and corporate staff for "shredding" his employees in corporate meetings and "being out of touch with reality," as well as for failing to invest in the physical stores, as many of them are deteriorating. [19]
Personal life[edit]
In 2001, he married Kinga Lampert and they have three children.[1][2] They have homes in Indian Creek Village, Florida,[20] Aspen, Colorado,[21] and Greenwich, Connecticut.[22] The couple are active members of their local Chabad house.[23]
In 2003, Lampert was kidnapped from the parking lot of his Greenwich office, but was able to convince his captors to let him go after two days of captivity.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Lampert was born in 1962 to Dolores Lampert and Floyd M. Lampert. His mother was a housewife. His father was a senior partner in the law firm of Lampert & Lampert in New York City. He has a younger sister Tracey.[5] Lampert's grandmother was a passive investor and big fan of Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street Week television program. She instilled in him an interest in investing. His mother would later recall that young Eddie would sit with his grandmother reviewing and evaluating the performance of her stock picks in the daily newspaper.[2]
Lampert's father died at the age of 47 and his mother took a job as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue.[6] His mother would later say: "Eddie really assumed the responsibility, knowing that life had changed and we had to accomplish something by ourselves now."[2] In order to help support his family, Eddie worked after school and on weekends at various warehouses, stocking shelves and filling orders. Despite working, he earned good grades, played both soccer and basketball, and won the scholar athlete award at his high school. He received financial aid to help pay for college.[6] Lampert graduated from Yale University in 1984 (B.A., economics, summa cum laude), where he was a member of Skull and Bones[2][7] and Phi Beta Kappa.
Career[edit]
In July 1984, Lampert worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs, and then worked in the firm's risk arbitrage department from March 1985 to February 1988. While there, he worked directly with Robert Rubin. When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.
In April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name ESL derives from Lampert's initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.
Lampert typically holds his investments for several years and usually has between three and fifteen stocks in his portfolio. His investment style was once drawing comparisons to the financier Warren Buffett.[2]
Lampert's earnings in 2004 were estimated to be $1.02 billion, making him the first Wall Street financial manager to exceed an income of $1 billion in a single year.[8] In 2006, Lampert was featured on the Time 100 list for most influential people in the world for being one of the "brightest minds on Wall Street" and leading a new class of activist hedge funds.[9] Lampert was the richest person in Connecticut in 2006 with a net worth of $3.8 billion.[10]
Lampert's earnings in 2006 were estimated to be from $1.0 to $1.5 billion.
In March 2012, Lampert was No. 367 on the Forbes world wealthiest people list with a net worth of $3.1 billion.[11] By August, 2016, Lampert had fallen to No. 810 on the list, with a net worth of $2.2 billion.[1][12]
In January 2013, it was announced that Lampert would take over as chief executive officer at Sears after Louis D'Ambrosio stepped down due to family health matters, which took effect in May 2013.[13] In July 2016 he held 28% of shares in Sears Holdings Corp worth of approximately $408 million.[14]
Lampert is an avid follower of Ayn Rand[15] and has used elements of Rand's philosophy to guide his business decisions.[16]
In early 2017, Lampert, then president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holdings, was estimated to have personal assets of $2 billion, primarily in the hedge fund ESL Investments Inc.[17] Early in the year, he committed to providing an additional loan of $500 million to Sears and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling $200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.[18]
He has been strongly criticized by employees and corporate staff for "shredding" his employees in corporate meetings and "being out of touch with reality," as well as for failing to invest in the physical stores, as many of them are deteriorating. [19]
Personal life[edit]
In 2001, he married Kinga Lampert and they have three children.[1][2] They have homes in Indian Creek Village, Florida,[20] Aspen, Colorado,[21] and Greenwich, Connecticut.[22] The couple are active members of their local Chabad house.[23]
In 2003, Lampert was kidnapped from the parking lot of his Greenwich office, but was able to convince his captors to let him go after two days of captivity.[2]

About Edward Lampert
American investor and businessman Edward Lampert has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion as of April 2016, according to Forbes. He currently serves as Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD)’s Chairman. In addition to being the founder, Edward Lampert also sits as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of ESL Investments. From July 1999 to October 2006, he served as AutoZone, Inc.’s director. He also worked for AutoNation, Inc as the company’s director until May 2007.

Edward Lampert was born on July 19, 1962 in Roslyn, New York. In 1984, he graduated from Yale University with a degree in Economics as summa cum laude. He is currently married to Kinga Lampert with whom he has three children.
After graduation, he worked for Goldman Sachs. Four years later, he left the company to establish ESL Investments which was based in Greenwich, Connecticut. With the help of Richard Rainwater who gave him a seed money amounting to $28 million, as well as helping him meet clients like David Geffen, ESL Investments was finally formed. Eventually, he played a major role in the merging of Sears and Kmart which led to the formation of Sears Holdings.
In 2004, he earned an annual income of $1.02 billion making him the first Wall Street financial manager to have earned over $1 billion income in a single year. In 2006, he was named as the wealthiest person in Connecticut with his $3.8 billion net worth.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
