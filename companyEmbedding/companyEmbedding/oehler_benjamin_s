Board of Directors
Bradley Berman  -  Chairman of the Board
Bradley Berman, who currently serves as an independent director, has been a director of Black Ridge since our inception and began serving as the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in November 2010. Under Mr. Berman's stewardship, Black Ridge accumulated our initial 10,000 net mineral acres in North Dakota & Montana’s Bakken & Three Forks play. Having successfully launched the company into the oil & gas business, Mr. Berman recruited a seasoned energy executive, Mr. Ken DeCubellis, to take his place as Black Ridge's new CEO in November, 2011. Mr. Berman’s introduction to the industry came by way of his role as a board member of Ante4, Inc. (previously, WPT), a position he held since 2004.  Mr. Berman was instrumental in navigating Ante4 into a merger with Plains Energy, which resulted in the creation of Voyager Oil & Gas, Inc.  Mr. Berman served on the board of Voyager until he assumed the role of CEO at Black Ridge in November 2010. Mr. Berman is President of King Show Games, Inc., a gaming development company he founded in 1998. Between 1992 and 2004, Mr. Berman worked in various capacities at Grand Casinos, Inc. and then Lakes Entertainment, Inc., achieving the position of Vice President of Gaming. Mr. Berman is a fourth generation entrepreneur – his family has launched successful businesses in a variety of opportunistic industries.
Benjamin Oehler  -  Independent Director
Benjamin S. Oehler has been a director of Black Ridge since November 16, 2010, and chairman of our audit committee and compensation committee since February 22, 2011. From 1999 to 2007, Mr. Oehler served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Waycrosse, Inc., a financial advisory firm for the family owners of Cargill Incorporated. While at Waycrosse, Mr. Oehler played a key role in two major growth initiatives for Cargill: the merger of Cargill’s fertilizer business into a public company which is now Mosaic, Inc., and the transformation of Cargill’s proprietary financial markets trading group into two major investment management companies: Black River Asset Management, LLC and CarVal Investors, LLC. Prior to joining Waycrosse, Mr. Oehler was an investment banker for Piper Jaffray. By the time he left Piper Jaffray in 1999, he was group head for Piper’s Industrial Growth Team. He has also played a leadership role in a number of corporate buy-outs and venture stage companies, served on corporate and non-profit boards of directors, and has been involved in the creation and oversight of foundations and charitable organizations, as well as U.S. trusts and off shore entities. Mr. Oehler has been a board member of many companies and non-profit organizations and completed the Stanford University Law School Directors Forum, a three-day update on key issues facing corporate directors presented by the Stanford Business School and Stanford Law School.
Joseph Lahti  -  Independent Director
Joseph Lahti is a Minneapolis native and leader in numerous Minnesota business and community organizations. As principal of JL Holdings since 1989, Mr. Lahti has provided funding and management leadership to several early-stage or distressed companies.

Benjamins: unieke en leuke
producten die de ontwikkeling van je kind
stimuleren. 
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamins
Schuifbestekje is ontwikkeld voor eigenwijze peuters die graag
alles (ALLES!) zelf willen doen, waaronder zelf eten. Zeker voor
die types die dat ook nog eens luid en duidelijk kenbaar maken.
Omdat met gewoon kinderbestek de spaghetti nog wel eens aan het
plafond eindigt, de doperwten tussen de plinten en de rijst in de
romper, is Benjamins Schuifbestekje ontwikkeld.
