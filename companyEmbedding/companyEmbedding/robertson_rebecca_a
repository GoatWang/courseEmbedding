Chase | Apple Pay
Chase needed to build a relationship with their customers by transcending the rational and goes beyond the product utility. We created a spot to launch Chase and Apple Pay on the new iPhone6. Partnering with up and coming band, Bleachers, we used them to tell the story of the simplicity and seamlessness of Apple Pay, letting them get on with their day and on with the show.










Chase | Freedom
We launched a new brand positioning for the Chase Freedom cash back credit card. In a sea of sameness and no real differentiation in the minds of consumers, we had to develop a point of view that set the premise of the brand and reintroduced Chase Freedom as the card For the Fun things to the Millennial consumer.

Yoplait | Family
After declining growth and having always been seen as a dessert replacement for weight managing women, we needed to reframe Yoplait as a snack for the whole family. In a move away from the Yoplait advertising of the past, we focused on more story, less telling by showcasing relevant and modern scenarios involving the whole family.

In a move away from the Yoplait advertising of the past, we focused on more story, less telling by showcasing these family members in relevant and modern scenarios.










Yoplait | Kids
GoGurt is the top kids yogurt in the US and whilst they are always partnering with kid entertainment franchises to feel new and fresh to kids coming in and out of the category, we wanted to go beyond just characters on the packaging. In a first for both the Despicable Me franchise and GoGurt, we brought the idea to Universal Pictures who agreed this captured the spirit of the Minions, and so they agreed to have the film's animators create an original animation for us, in between finishing animating the film. It was seen as a new way to partner with studios and held up as the way we should be collaborating together moving forward.

Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series on A&E that portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call called Duck Commander. The Robertson men—brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep—are known for their long beards and their Christian views.[1] The family was previously featured on the series Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its spin-off, Buck Commander, on the Outdoor Channel;[2] Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty in 2016.[3]
The show has broken several ratings records on A&E and cable television as a whole. The fourth-season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history.[4] In mid-December 2013, controversy from an interview Phil Robertson gave to GQ magazine resulted in an indefinite suspension by A&E, due to remarks he made which were being widely reported in the media as "anti-gay".[5][6] Following public pressure on A&E to lift the suspension, he was reinstated nine days later.[7]
The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.[8][9][10] The series ended on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale "End of an Era".[11]

Phil Robertson[edit]
Main article: Phil Robertson
The family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call. He was a standout quarterback at Louisiana Tech[12] (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw) and was contacted by the Washington Redskins after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.[13]
Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.[14] Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.[15][16]
Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "yuppies". At the end of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.[17]

Criticism[edit]
Editing controversy[edit]
In 2012, Phil Robertson stated on Sports Spectrum, a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent bleep censors over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.[74][75] Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "spiritual warfare", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.[76]
GQ interview[edit]
On December 18, 2013, A&E announced that it was suspending Phil Robertson from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary (GQ Magazine) which had attracted outside criticism.[77] During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"[78] Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."[79]




Robertson speaking at CPAC 2015 in Washington, D.C.


A&E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."[80]
The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, supporting Phil and saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."[81] In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?"[82][83]

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions.[84] Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted.[85][86]
In response, Cracker Barrel removed some Duck Dynasty products.[87] The products were replaced after one day after a public outcry.[88] United Press International reported that A&E CEO Nancy Dubuc had received death threats for the decision to suspend Robertson indefinitely.[89]
On December 27, A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in regards to discussing body parts,[90] and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."[91][92] A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."[92]
CNN said the controversy showed that a culture war was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a First Amendment right to free speech,[92][93][94][95] while others[who?] said that the First Amendment did not apply.[96]
Other television and media[edit]
The Robertsons appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Scheduled musical guest Morrissey canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band Churchill filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.[97] The Robertsons have appeared on Conan, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Live! with Kelly and Michael, Today, Katie, The Wendy Williams Show and 700 Club. Willie Robertson appeared on FNC's The Five on August 13, 2013.[98]
The Robertsons guest-starred on the season three premiere of Last Man Standing. Members of Duck Dynasty are featured in the music video of the No. 1 country song "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.[99]
Si Robertson lent his voice and personal appearance to the VeggieTales video, Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, in which he narrates the video and appears as an okra mall janitor.[100][101]
Sadie Robertson was a contestant on season 19 of Dancing With the Stars. Other members of her family appeared on one episode as well.[102]
Christmas album[edit]
On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the family was working on a Christmas album.[103] Titled Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas, it was released on the UMG Nashville label on October 29, 2013.[104]

Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series on A&E that portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call called Duck Commander. The Robertson men—brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep—are known for their long beards and their Christian views.[1] The family was previously featured on the series Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its spin-off, Buck Commander, on the Outdoor Channel;[2] Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty in 2016.[3]
The show has broken several ratings records on A&E and cable television as a whole. The fourth-season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history.[4] In mid-December 2013, controversy from an interview Phil Robertson gave to GQ magazine resulted in an indefinite suspension by A&E, due to remarks he made which were being widely reported in the media as "anti-gay".[5][6] Following public pressure on A&E to lift the suspension, he was reinstated nine days later.[7]
The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.[8][9][10] The series ended on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale "End of an Era".[11]

Phil Robertson[edit]
Main article: Phil Robertson
The family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call. He was a standout quarterback at Louisiana Tech[12] (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw) and was contacted by the Washington Redskins after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.[13]
Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.[14] Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.[15][16]
Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "yuppies". At the end of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.[17]

The family originally were Rebecca's host when she was an exchange student from Taiwan and have since adopted her as their own.[25][26] After completing a two-year fashion internship in Southern California, she returned home to West Monroe and opened a clothing boutique. She married her fiancee, John Reed Loflin, in Mexico on December 3, 2016.[27]

Criticism[edit]
Editing controversy[edit]
In 2012, Phil Robertson stated on Sports Spectrum, a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent bleep censors over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.[74][75] Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "spiritual warfare", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.[76]
GQ interview[edit]
On December 18, 2013, A&E announced that it was suspending Phil Robertson from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary (GQ Magazine) which had attracted outside criticism.[77] During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"[78] Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."[79]




Robertson speaking at CPAC 2015 in Washington, D.C.


A&E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."[80]
The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, supporting Phil and saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."[81] In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?"[82][83]

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions.[84] Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted.[85][86]
In response, Cracker Barrel removed some Duck Dynasty products.[87] The products were replaced after one day after a public outcry.[88] United Press International reported that A&E CEO Nancy Dubuc had received death threats for the decision to suspend Robertson indefinitely.[89]
On December 27, A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in regards to discussing body parts,[90] and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."[91][92] A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."[92]
CNN said the controversy showed that a culture war was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a First Amendment right to free speech,[92][93][94][95] while others[who?] said that the First Amendment did not apply.[96]
Other television and media[edit]
The Robertsons appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Scheduled musical guest Morrissey canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band Churchill filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.[97] The Robertsons have appeared on Conan, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Live! with Kelly and Michael, Today, Katie, The Wendy Williams Show and 700 Club. Willie Robertson appeared on FNC's The Five on August 13, 2013.[98]
The Robertsons guest-starred on the season three premiere of Last Man Standing. Members of Duck Dynasty are featured in the music video of the No. 1 country song "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.[99]
Si Robertson lent his voice and personal appearance to the VeggieTales video, Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, in which he narrates the video and appears as an okra mall janitor.[100][101]
Sadie Robertson was a contestant on season 19 of Dancing With the Stars. Other members of her family appeared on one episode as well.[102]
Christmas album[edit]
On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the family was working on a Christmas album.[103] Titled Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas, it was released on the UMG Nashville label on October 29, 2013.[104]

Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series on A&E that portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call called Duck Commander. The Robertson men—brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep—are known for their long beards and their Christian views.[1] The family was previously featured on the series Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its spin-off, Buck Commander, on the Outdoor Channel;[2] Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty in 2016.[3]
The show has broken several ratings records on A&E and cable television as a whole. The fourth-season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history.[4] In mid-December 2013, controversy from an interview Phil Robertson gave to GQ magazine resulted in an indefinite suspension by A&E, due to remarks he made which were being widely reported in the media as "anti-gay".[5][6] Following public pressure on A&E to lift the suspension, he was reinstated nine days later.[7]
The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.[8][9][10] The series ended on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale "End of an Era".[11]

Phil Robertson[edit]
Main article: Phil Robertson
The family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call. He was a standout quarterback at Louisiana Tech[12] (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw) and was contacted by the Washington Redskins after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.[13]
Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.[14] Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.[15][16]
Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "yuppies". At the end of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.[17]

Criticism[edit]
Editing controversy[edit]
In 2012, Phil Robertson stated on Sports Spectrum, a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent bleep censors over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.[74][75] Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "spiritual warfare", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.[76]
GQ interview[edit]
On December 18, 2013, A&E announced that it was suspending Phil Robertson from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary (GQ Magazine) which had attracted outside criticism.[77] During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"[78] Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."[79]




Robertson speaking at CPAC 2015 in Washington, D.C.


A&E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."[80]
The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, supporting Phil and saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."[81] In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?"[82][83]

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions.[84] Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted.[85][86]
In response, Cracker Barrel removed some Duck Dynasty products.[87] The products were replaced after one day after a public outcry.[88] United Press International reported that A&E CEO Nancy Dubuc had received death threats for the decision to suspend Robertson indefinitely.[89]
On December 27, A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in regards to discussing body parts,[90] and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."[91][92] A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."[92]
CNN said the controversy showed that a culture war was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a First Amendment right to free speech,[92][93][94][95] while others[who?] said that the First Amendment did not apply.[96]
Other television and media[edit]
The Robertsons appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Scheduled musical guest Morrissey canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band Churchill filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.[97] The Robertsons have appeared on Conan, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Live! with Kelly and Michael, Today, Katie, The Wendy Williams Show and 700 Club. Willie Robertson appeared on FNC's The Five on August 13, 2013.[98]
The Robertsons guest-starred on the season three premiere of Last Man Standing. Members of Duck Dynasty are featured in the music video of the No. 1 country song "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.[99]
Si Robertson lent his voice and personal appearance to the VeggieTales video, Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, in which he narrates the video and appears as an okra mall janitor.[100][101]
Sadie Robertson was a contestant on season 19 of Dancing With the Stars. Other members of her family appeared on one episode as well.[102]
Christmas album[edit]
On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the family was working on a Christmas album.[103] Titled Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas, it was released on the UMG Nashville label on October 29, 2013.[104]

Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series on A&E that portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call called Duck Commander. The Robertson men—brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep—are known for their long beards and their Christian views.[1] The family was previously featured on the series Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its spin-off, Buck Commander, on the Outdoor Channel;[2] Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty in 2016.[3]
The show has broken several ratings records on A&E and cable television as a whole. The fourth-season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history.[4] In mid-December 2013, controversy from an interview Phil Robertson gave to GQ magazine resulted in an indefinite suspension by A&E, due to remarks he made which were being widely reported in the media as "anti-gay".[5][6] Following public pressure on A&E to lift the suspension, he was reinstated nine days later.[7]
The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.[8][9][10] The series ended on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale "End of an Era".[11]

Phil Robertson[edit]
Main article: Phil Robertson
The family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call. He was a standout quarterback at Louisiana Tech[12] (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw) and was contacted by the Washington Redskins after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.[13]
Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.[14] Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.[15][16]
Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "yuppies". At the end of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.[17]

Criticism[edit]
Editing controversy[edit]
In 2012, Phil Robertson stated on Sports Spectrum, a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent bleep censors over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.[74][75] Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "spiritual warfare", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.[76]
GQ interview[edit]
On December 18, 2013, A&E announced that it was suspending Phil Robertson from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary (GQ Magazine) which had attracted outside criticism.[77] During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"[78] Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."[79]




Robertson speaking at CPAC 2015 in Washington, D.C.


A&E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."[80]
The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, supporting Phil and saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."[81] In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?"[82][83]

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions.[84] Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted.[85][86]
In response, Cracker Barrel removed some Duck Dynasty products.[87] The products were replaced after one day after a public outcry.[88] United Press International reported that A&E CEO Nancy Dubuc had received death threats for the decision to suspend Robertson indefinitely.[89]
On December 27, A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in regards to discussing body parts,[90] and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."[91][92] A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."[92]
CNN said the controversy showed that a culture war was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a First Amendment right to free speech,[92][93][94][95] while others[who?] said that the First Amendment did not apply.[96]
Other television and media[edit]
The Robertsons appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Scheduled musical guest Morrissey canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band Churchill filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.[97] The Robertsons have appeared on Conan, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Live! with Kelly and Michael, Today, Katie, The Wendy Williams Show and 700 Club. Willie Robertson appeared on FNC's The Five on August 13, 2013.[98]
The Robertsons guest-starred on the season three premiere of Last Man Standing. Members of Duck Dynasty are featured in the music video of the No. 1 country song "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.[99]
Si Robertson lent his voice and personal appearance to the VeggieTales video, Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, in which he narrates the video and appears as an okra mall janitor.[100][101]
Sadie Robertson was a contestant on season 19 of Dancing With the Stars. Other members of her family appeared on one episode as well.[102]
Christmas album[edit]
On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the family was working on a Christmas album.[103] Titled Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas, it was released on the UMG Nashville label on October 29, 2013.[104]

Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series on A&E that portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call called Duck Commander. The Robertson men—brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep—are known for their long beards and their Christian views.[1] The family was previously featured on the series Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its spin-off, Buck Commander, on the Outdoor Channel;[2] Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty in 2016.[3]
The show has broken several ratings records on A&E and cable television as a whole. The fourth-season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history.[4] In mid-December 2013, controversy from an interview Phil Robertson gave to GQ magazine resulted in an indefinite suspension by A&E, due to remarks he made which were being widely reported in the media as "anti-gay".[5][6] Following public pressure on A&E to lift the suspension, he was reinstated nine days later.[7]
The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.[8][9][10] The series ended on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale "End of an Era".[11]

Phil Robertson[edit]
Main article: Phil Robertson
The family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call. He was a standout quarterback at Louisiana Tech[12] (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw) and was contacted by the Washington Redskins after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.[13]
Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.[14] Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.[15][16]
Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "yuppies". At the end of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.[17]

Criticism[edit]
Editing controversy[edit]
In 2012, Phil Robertson stated on Sports Spectrum, a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent bleep censors over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.[74][75] Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "spiritual warfare", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.[76]
GQ interview[edit]
On December 18, 2013, A&E announced that it was suspending Phil Robertson from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary (GQ Magazine) which had attracted outside criticism.[77] During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"[78] Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."[79]




Robertson speaking at CPAC 2015 in Washington, D.C.


A&E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."[80]
The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, supporting Phil and saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."[81] In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?"[82][83]

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions.[84] Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted.[85][86]
In response, Cracker Barrel removed some Duck Dynasty products.[87] The products were replaced after one day after a public outcry.[88] United Press International reported that A&E CEO Nancy Dubuc had received death threats for the decision to suspend Robertson indefinitely.[89]
On December 27, A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in regards to discussing body parts,[90] and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."[91][92] A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."[92]
CNN said the controversy showed that a culture war was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a First Amendment right to free speech,[92][93][94][95] while others[who?] said that the First Amendment did not apply.[96]
Other television and media[edit]
The Robertsons appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Scheduled musical guest Morrissey canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band Churchill filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.[97] The Robertsons have appeared on Conan, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Live! with Kelly and Michael, Today, Katie, The Wendy Williams Show and 700 Club. Willie Robertson appeared on FNC's The Five on August 13, 2013.[98]
The Robertsons guest-starred on the season three premiere of Last Man Standing. Members of Duck Dynasty are featured in the music video of the No. 1 country song "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.[99]
Si Robertson lent his voice and personal appearance to the VeggieTales video, Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, in which he narrates the video and appears as an okra mall janitor.[100][101]
Sadie Robertson was a contestant on season 19 of Dancing With the Stars. Other members of her family appeared on one episode as well.[102]

On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the family was working on a Christmas album.[103] Titled Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas, it was released on the UMG Nashville label on October 29, 2013.[104]

Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series on A&E that portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call called Duck Commander. The Robertson men—brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep—are known for their long beards and their Christian views.[1] The family was previously featured on the series Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its spin-off, Buck Commander, on the Outdoor Channel;[2] Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty in 2016.[3]
The show has broken several ratings records on A&E and cable television as a whole. The fourth-season premiere drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history.[4] In mid-December 2013, controversy from an interview Phil Robertson gave to GQ magazine resulted in an indefinite suspension by A&E, due to remarks he made which were being widely reported in the media as "anti-gay".[5][6] Following public pressure on A&E to lift the suspension, he was reinstated nine days later.[7]
The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.[8][9][10] The series ended on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale "End of an Era".[11]

Phil Robertson[edit]
Main article: Phil Robertson
The family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call. He was a standout quarterback at Louisiana Tech[12] (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw) and was contacted by the Washington Redskins after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.[13]
Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.[14] Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.[15][16]
Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "yuppies". At the end of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.[17]

Criticism[edit]
Editing controversy[edit]
In 2012, Phil Robertson stated on Sports Spectrum, a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent bleep censors over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.[74][75] Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "spiritual warfare", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.[76]
GQ interview[edit]
On December 18, 2013, A&E announced that it was suspending Phil Robertson from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary (GQ Magazine) which had attracted outside criticism.[77] During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"[78] Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."[79]




Robertson speaking at CPAC 2015 in Washington, D.C.


A&E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."[80]
The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, supporting Phil and saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."[81] In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?"[82][83]

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions.[84] Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted.[85][86]
In response, Cracker Barrel removed some Duck Dynasty products.[87] The products were replaced after one day after a public outcry.[88] United Press International reported that A&E CEO Nancy Dubuc had received death threats for the decision to suspend Robertson indefinitely.[89]
On December 27, A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in regards to discussing body parts,[90] and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."[91][92] A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."[92]
CNN said the controversy showed that a culture war was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a First Amendment right to free speech,[92][93][94][95] while others[who?] said that the First Amendment did not apply.[96]
Other television and media[edit]
The Robertsons appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Scheduled musical guest Morrissey canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band Churchill filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.[97] The Robertsons have appeared on Conan, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Live! with Kelly and Michael, Today, Katie, The Wendy Williams Show and 700 Club. Willie Robertson appeared on FNC's The Five on August 13, 2013.[98]
The Robertsons guest-starred on the season three premiere of Last Man Standing. Members of Duck Dynasty are featured in the music video of the No. 1 country song "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker.[99]
Si Robertson lent his voice and personal appearance to the VeggieTales video, Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, in which he narrates the video and appears as an okra mall janitor.[100][101]
Sadie Robertson was a contestant on season 19 of Dancing With the Stars. Other members of her family appeared on one episode as well.[102]
Christmas album[edit]
On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the family was working on a Christmas album.[103] Titled Duck the Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas, it was released on the UMG Nashville label on October 29, 2013.[104]
