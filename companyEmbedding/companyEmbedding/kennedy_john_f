Product Description
Robert Dallek’s masterful John F. Kennedy: An Unfinished Life was a number one national bestseller, and it remains the most widely read one-volume biography of the 35th President. Now, in this marvelous short biography of John F. Kennedy, Dallek achieves a miracle of compression, capturing in a small space the essence of his renowned full-length masterpiece.
Here readers will find the fascinating insights and groundbreaking revelations found in An Unfinished Life. The heart of the book focuses on Kennedy’s political career, especially the presidency. The book sheds light on key foreign affairs issues such as the Bay of Pigs debacle, Khrushchev’s misguided bullying of Kennedy in Vienna, the Cuban Missile crisis, the nuclear test ban, the race for space, and the initial dealings with Southeast Asia, especially Laos. It also highlights the difficulties Kennedy faced getting a domestic agenda passed, from a tax cut to spur the economy, to federal aid to education, Medicare, and civil rights. Dallek reveals the thinking behind Robert Kennedy’s appointment as Attorney General and convincingly argues that Kennedy would never have expanded the war in Vietnam the way that Lyndon Johnson did. The book also addresses questions about Kennedy’s assassination and concludes with his presidential legacy and why he remains so popular despite serving only a thousand days in office.
Based upon the definitive biography, John F. Kennedy offers readers a concise, authoritative, and highly readable life of one of our best-loved presidents.

John F Kennedy
Lyrics (c) 2016 Rex Luciferius
 
The night before I was born
Daddy drove momma thru a storm
So I could be born
As Nostradamus had warned

That same night John F Kennedy
Was nominated by his party to run
I was born early the next morn
From a Branch Long Barren

Now my very first memory
Is of a young man hung on our wall
It was a color photo of
John F Kennedy

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

At the age of three
I have a vivid memory
My granny and mamma crying
They had shot John F Kennedy

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

My momma  said son
Put away your chlids toys
You must watch them bury
John F Kennedy

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

So I sat before a black and white TV
Saw a little boy salute the world
Saw a horse drawn casket with
John F Kennedy

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

I saw grown men cry
I saw a world loose hope
All because we had lost
John F Kennedy

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

I;m now a grown man in a dark world
Since I’ve seen so many lights
All shot dead in the head
Like John F Kennedy

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

Now nothing seems quite right
Even the blackness of the night
Where stars no longer shine bright
Long gone the shining white knights

John F Kennedy
The great hope of humanity
Shot in the head
For the world to see hope was dead

John F. Kennedy
From Plank Road Publishingby Karl HitzemannThis cross-curricular song talks a bit about John F. Kennedy's life and incorporates the famous line from his Inaugural Address: "Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country." The style of the song is in keeping with the folk music of that era and is very singable and unison (except for an optional divisi at the end). Whether you're studying John F. Kennedy, the 1960s, presidential history, or folk music, this song will fit in nicely.  (from Music K-8, Vol. 21, No. 3)About the Downloadable OptionThe downloadable version contains all the components the print version would, but in electronic format. Files may be quite large: A high-speed connection is recommended. (Visit the Download Help page for more info.)

It was thought to belong to Mary Pinchot Meyer who JFK had a relationship with. He wrote her a love letter in October 1963. She was privy to information of national security concerns. She was murdered shortly after JFK's assassination. Many conspiracy theorist think she was murdered to keep her quiet. A fascinating artifact from JFK's White House.

Items owned by JFK with Evelyn Lincoln letters are very desirable and valuable to collectors and historians.

Mary Eno Pinchot Meyer (October 14, 1920 – October 12, 1964) was an American painter living in Washington D.C. At the time of her death, her work was considered part of the Washington Color School and was selected for the Pan American Union Art Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in Buenos Aires. She was married to Central Intelligence Agency official Cord Meyer from 1945-1958, and she was linked romantically to the late President John F. Kennedy after her marriage to Meyer. Rumors and tabloid press reports of her affair with Kennedy were confirmed by her late brother-in-law, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, in his 1995 autobiography A Good Life A love letter Kennedy wrote to Pinchot Meyer one month before his assassination surfaced in June 2016. 
Meyer was shot to death on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath on October 12, 1964, three weeks after the release of the Warren Commission Report, whose conclusions Meyer allegedly challenged. Meyer’s long history of criticism of the CIA, the timing of her killing, the CIA’s wiretapping of her phone, and the effort by CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton to retrieve Meyer’s diary immediately after her death have prompted investigation of possible CIA involvement in her murder. Additionally, Army personnel records for prosecution witness Lt. William L. Mitchell, released in 2015 and 2016 under the Freedom of Information Act, corroborate his ties to the intelligence community. CIA involvement has also been suggested by the phone call that was placed by top Agency official Wistar Janney to Ben Bradlee, hours before the police had identified Meyer’s body. The man accused of the murder, Ray Crump, Jr., was acquitted at trial in July, 1965. The murder remains officially unsolved.

John F. Kennedy





	John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (1961-1963), the youngest man elected to the office. On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, becoming also the youngest President to die.




	On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullets as his motorcade wound through Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was the youngest man elected President; he was the youngest to die.

	Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety.

	Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history.

	In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President.

	His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: "Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country." As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and poverty.

	Responding to ever more urgent demands, he took vigorous action in the cause of equal rights, calling for new civil rights legislation. His vision of America extended to the quality of the national culture and the central role of the arts in a vital society.

	He wished America to resume its old mission as the first nation dedicated to the revolution of human rights. With the Alliance for Progress and the Peace Corps, he brought American idealism to the aid of developing nations. But the hard reality of the Communist challenge remained.

	Shortly after his inauguration, Kennedy permitted a band of Cuban exiles, already armed and trained, to invade their homeland. The attempt to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro was a failure. Soon thereafter, the Soviet Union renewed its campaign against West Berlin. Kennedy replied by reinforcing the Berlin garrison and increasing the Nation's military strength, including new efforts in outer space. Confronted by this reaction, Moscow, after the erection of the Berlin Wall, relaxed its pressure in central Europe.

	Instead, the Russians now sought to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. When this was discovered by air reconnaissance in October 1962, Kennedy imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons bound for Cuba. While the world trembled on the brink of nuclear war, the Russians backed down and agreed to take the missiles away. The American response to the Cuban crisis evidently persuaded Moscow of the futility of nuclear blackmail.

	Kennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and slowing the arms race--a contention which led to the test ban treaty of 1963. The months after the Cuban crisis showed significant progress toward his goal of "a world of law and free choice, banishing the world of war and coercion." His administration thus saw the beginning of new hope for both the equal rights of Americans and the peace of the world.

The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey. Copyright 2006 by the White House Historical Association.

Did you know?


		President John F. Kennedy famously suggested the American people: “Ask what you can do for your country.” In 1961, the Peace Corps was created, facilitating service among citizens working toward peace in developing countries. In 2011, President Obama celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Peace Corps with a Presidential Proclamation.

Kennedy Reverse Proof coin to your cart today!John Fitzgerald Kennedy, also known as "JFK", was born in May 1917 in Massachusetts and spent the first 10 years of his life in Boston until his family moved to the Bronx where he spent his middle school years. Kennedy later went on to study at the London School of Economics and Harvard University which laid the foundations of his political career. The Kennedy family was a very well established US political family and produced a president, three senators and multiple other politicians.Kennedy had a distinguished military career from 1941-1945 and served in WW2. One notable event was when the torpedo boat Kennedy was serving on was sunk. In order to save the crew he had to swim a distance of about three and a half miles at night whilst towing an injured comrade from the wreck to a nearby island! JFK received multiple medals and awards for his service including the Purple Heart making him the only president to receive one.JFK was the 35th President of the United States and served from January 1961 until his assassination on 22nd November 1963. Despite his relatively short service he was incredibly influential and advocated for freedom home and abroad. Kennedy presided during some very pivotal events including the Cuban Missile Crisis, The Bay of Pigs invasion, the nuclear test ban treaty, the establishment of the Peace Corps, developments in the Space Race, the building of the Berlin Wall, the Trade Expansion Act to lower tariffs, and the Civil Rights Movement.The assassination of JFK is a topic that breeds much controversy and debate. The official report is that he was shot by lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, Texas.

                      History
                    




                    The Pobjoy Mint has been a leader in innovative coin design and craftsmanship for more than 50 years. Derek Pobjoy started the private mint in 1965, coming from a background in jewelry. The first coins minted were commemorative Sterling Silver and Gold coins in memory of former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, which launched the mint into becoming a huge success. The idea that countries, big or small, can and should have their own coinage is what pushed the Pobjoy Mint forward. Pobjoy approached the Isle of Man government to begin a program of collector coins with corresponding values and specifications as British coins. In 1972, the Pobjoy Mint created the first practical set of coins for the Isle of Man including a 1/2 penny and up to 50 pence coins. These coins included historical and cultural elements, such as the Isle of Man’s distinctive three-legged “Triskele” insignia. Since then, the Pobjoy Mint has issued an array of innovative and artistic coins sought after by some of the choosiest collectors. One particular contribution to numismatics and coin production was the development of the world’s first satisfactory man-made Precious Metal, called Virenium, which has been used in high denomination coinage since 1978. This was hailed worldwide as the first significant breakthrough in coinage from the last century. The Pobjoy Mint provides circulation and collector coinage for 12 countries and territories, and that number is ever increasing. Pobjoy Mint has been consistently recognized within the numismatic industry for their innovations, including 45 “firsts” such as the first Silver one kilo coin, the first coin in the shape of the Eiffel Tower, the first titanium coin and the world’s highest relief coin. The Pobjoy Mint has demonstrated their ability to push the limits of the coin industry to surprising achievements and new heights.

Silver Coins, Silver Bullion and Silver Bars

Buy Silver Bullion Coins, Bars & Rounds
What is the best place to buy Silver? Buying Silver bullion, rounds and coins is an excellent way to get started in Precious Metals investing. Buying Silver is easy when you shop with APMEX. We have an immense inventory and an impeccable reputation, so when you begin buying Silver, you know APMEX is a logical first stop.
Silver is produced in the form of Silver coins, Silver bars and Silver rounds from mints and Precious Metal refiners around the world. Silver is one of the world’s most important commodities and an affordable Precious Metal investment option. For thousands of years, Silver bullion has served as a primary monetary metal, but today it is most commonly used as an industrial commodity. As an investment, Silver can play an important role in a modern diversified portfolio. Silver prices generally move independent of stocks and can provide a bright spot in your investment portfolio during an economic downturn. 
If you’re new to investing in Silver, you can learn more about how to buy Silver or what Silver products to buy in our Education Center.






Silver Coins
Some Silver coins stay in families for generations, serving as both a bullion investment and collectible. Silver coins realize collectibility because of their design, scarcity and demand. Each year, new coins are minted in different variations which may never be produced again. APMEX only sells Silver coins minted by the most trusted mints in the world. These mints include the United States Mint, Royal Canadian Mint, Perth Mint, Austrian Mint and more.
Silver coins are sold at a premium above Silver spot prices because of their unique designs and limited availability. Coins are usually sold in brilliant uncirculated condition, having not been used as actual currency. Once a coin loses its luster, it begins to lose its status in terms of condition. The highest quality Silver coins are known as proof coins. Popular for their intricate designs, proof coins are struck more than once, which leads to their brilliant shine.
Silver Bullion Coins
Silver bullion coins come in a variety of sizes from 1/25 oz to 1 kilo, and every size in between. There are mints and refiners all over the world that create unique and valuable Silver bullion coins. Whether you are a beginning or experienced collector, you will find a coin that fits your interests. The most common purchases are 1 ounce Silver coins, often bought by investors and collectors alike. Some of our most popular Silver coins include:



1 oz Silver American Eagle Coins





1 oz Silver Canadian Maple Leaf Coins





1 oz Silver Mexican Libertads Coins





1 oz Silver Panda Coins


 
New investors will find great comfort and emotional attachment from buying Silver coins. You can expect to pay more for a Silver coin than its Silver bullion counterparts, but because of the coin’s scarcity and collectibility, you’ll have a more fulfilling buying experience. There is almost an unlimited variety of Silver coins for your investing pleasure.







Silver Bars
Buying Silver bars is one of the most cost effective, safest and easiest ways to own physical Silver. Silver bars are the bullion of choice for many investors because they cost less over Silver spot price than Silver coins. Additionally, their uniform shape and size mean Silver bars are easy to store, count and transfer. APMEX sells Silver bars produced by Sunshine Mint, PAMP Suisse, RCM, Johnson Matthey and other respected Silver mints. Each Silver bar is stamped with its exact Silver weight, fineness, and a serial number for added security.
Silver Bullion Bars
Silver bullion bars come in a variety of sizes from 1 gram to 1 kilo or more, and every size in between. The most commonly traded Silver bars are 1 ounce, often purchased by avid investors. Some of our most popular Silver bars include:



1 oz Pamp Suisse Fortuna Silver Bar





1 oz APMEX Silver Bar





1 oz Sunshine Minting Silver Bar





1 oz Johnson Matthey Silver Bar


 
No matter which form of Silver bar you choose to invest in, you can rest assured knowing you’ll own the most authentic form of currency in the history of the world. 







Silver Rounds
Investors who are solely interested in Silver’s stable purchasing power can find security in buying Silver rounds. Silver rounds are circular discs often manufactured by private mints, though sometimes produced by government mints. They have no “face value” and are not recognized as legal tender. Silver rounds are not quite as diverse or collectible as Silver coins, but are an excellent choice for those who want to invest in Silver as an anti-inflation hedge.
Silver Bullion Rounds
Silver bullion rounds come in a number of different sizes from 1 gram to 16 oz, and every size in between. The most commonly traded Silver bullion rounds are 1 ounce or less. Some of our most popular Silver rounds include:



1 oz Silver Round Buffalo





1 oz Incuse Indian Silver Round





1 oz APMEX Silver Round





1 oz Sunshine Mint Silver Round


 
Though not as collectible as some Silver coins, Silver rounds are minted to an equally high standard with beautifully detailed designs and clean striking. Silver rounds typically sell for a lower premium relative to spot price and are an excellent addition to a mixed investment portfolio of Silver rounds, Silver coins and Silver bars. 
Silver Coin Price
Silver prices often fluctuate separately from money markets, including the stock market. With factors such as elections, political intrigue, shifts in the supply and demand market plus more play an important role in determining where the Silver coin and bullion price goes. 
Silver coins do come in various sizes with a wide selection available. Private mints and government mints produce high quality Silver that is available for you at competitive prices. In understanding the role Silver price plays to collectors and investors, you will have a better understanding of the value of your purchase. Shop Silver bullion coins and rounds today at APMEX.

Where can I buy Silver bullion? APMEX deals in top-quality Silver bullion, coins and rounds. Silver bullion is one of the easiest and most cost-effective Precious Metals investments one can make. Begin today by browsing APMEX's unparalleled inventory of Silver bullion.

Mini Bio (1)


          John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917 in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Rose Kennedy (née Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald) and Joseph P. Kennedy. John was named after his maternal grandfather, John "HoneyFitz" Fitzgerald, the mayor of Boston. John was very ill as a child and was given the last rites five times, the first one being when he was a new-born. He was the second of four boys born to an Irish Catholic family with nine children: Joseph Jr., John, Robert F. Kennedy (called Bobby), and Ted Kennedy (born Edward). Because Rose made Joe and Jack (the name his family called him) wear matching clothes, they fought a lot for attention. When John was young, the family moved from Boston to New York. John went to Choate, a private school. Most of the time, though, he was too sick to attend. In the late 1930s, father Joe became the ambassador to England. He took sons John and Robert with him, as well as his wife and daughters Kathleen and Rosemary Kennedy. John went to Princeton, then Harvard, and for his senior thesis, he wrote a piece about why England refused to get into the war until late. It was published in 1940 and called "Why England Slept". His older brother Joe was a pilot during the war, and was killed when the bombs his plane was carrying exploded. Not long after that, John's sister Kathleen and her husband died in a plane crash. In the early 1950s, John ran for Congress in Massachusetts and won. He married Jacqueline Kennedy (thirteen years his junior, born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier) on September 12, 1953. He became a father rather late in life. Their first child, Caroline Kennedy, was born on November 27, 1957 when J.F.K. was forty and their son, John Kennedy Jr., was born on November 25, 1960 when J.F.K. was forty-three. They had a son named Patrick Bouvier, but he died a few days after birth. In 1954, J.F.K. had to have back surgery and in the hospital wrote his second book, "Profiles in Courage". His father always said that his son Joe was going to be President of the U.S.; when he died in World War II, though, that task was passed on to John. He ran for president in 1960 against Richard Nixon and won. His administration had many conflicts, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis being key examples. In November 1963, he and Jackie (his wife's nickname) went on a trip to Texas. Everywhere they went there were signs saying "Jack and Jackie." On November 22, 1963, John was to give a speech in Dallas, but on his way an assassin hidden on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository opened fire at Kennedy, who was riding in an open car. Hit twice and severely wounded, Kennedy died in a local hospital at 1:00 P.M. The alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was captured a short time later after shooting and killing a Dallas policeman, and was himself assassinated before he could be thoroughly interrogated, let alone tried. In just a little bit of irony, considering the death of Abraham Lincoln a century earlier, Kennedy was shot in a Ford Lincoln (Lincoln was in Ford's Theater when he was shot). He was laid to rest on his son's third birthday.

      Died November 22, 1963, the same day as C.S. Lewis and Aldous Huxley.

      US Senator from Massachusetts from 1953-61.


      His Vice President, Texas congressman Lyndon Johnson, campaigned against him for the presidential spot in 1960, and Kennedy later chose him to be his Vice President because he needed Johnson to win over southern voters. John's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, disliked Johnson intensely and the feeling was mutual.

      The Lincoln Continental convertible limousine (plate: GG 300) in which he and then Texas governor John Connally and wife Nellie Connally were riding in on the day of Kennedy's assassination is on display in a museum in Dearborn, MI.


      In the course of his famous 1963 speech near the Berlin Wall, Kennedy had meant to say, "Ich bin Berliner" (I am a Berliner). Since nationalities in German are not preceded by articles, Kennedy actually said, "Ich bin ein Berliner" (I am one with the people of Berlin). The urban legend that it translates into "I am a jelly donut" is a myth, since the pastry is known in Germany as "pfannkuchen" (pan cake).


      Was portrayed by Martin Sheen in the miniseries Kennedy (1983).


      The second of only two US presidents to be entombed in Arlington National Cemetery, the first being William Howard Taft.


      "Black Jack", the riderless horse that served at his funeral, also participated in the funeral ceremonies of Presidents Herbert Hoover and Lyndon Johnson and Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Coincidentally, "Black Jack" was also the nickname of Jacqueline Kennedy's father.


      Brother-in-law of Lee Radziwill


      He had numerous bizarre distant connections with the 16th US president, Abraham Lincoln.


      Although privately he suffered from numerous illnesses and ailments, he insisted on a public image of rugged fitness and masculinity. Following his infamous debate against Richard Nixon, he spent a week in Florida tanning and working out on the beach. He was often photographed playing football with younger brother Robert F. Kennedy, working out and playing various sports with his family. In one famous photograph, he is pictured wearing a leather jacket, jeans and sunglasses, casually leaning against a wall. In reality, he was so exhausted from getting over a virus and the job, that he literally fell asleep standing up.


      Was portrayed by Stephen Collins in A Woman Named Jackie (1991) and Martin Donovan in RFK (2002).


      Grandson of Congressman John F. Fitzgerald.


      Uncle of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Joseph Kennedy and Congressman Patrick Kennedy.


      Both he and his brother Robert F. Kennedy have been portrayed by Martin Sheen.


      Was an avid reader, and at one point expressed his fondness for the James Bond novels of Ian Fleming. He said that a particular favorite was "From Russia with Love". For this reason, the producers of the Bond series made From Russia with Love (1963) the second Bond film.


      Encouraged Kirk Douglas to make the anti-nuclear movie Seven Days in May (1964).


      Was a Fourth-Degree member of the Knights of Columbus, belonging to both the Bunker Hill No. 62 and the Bishop Cheverus General Assembly.


      Fourth US president to be assassinated (unsuccessful attempts had been made on Presidents Andrew Jackson and Harry S. Truman, and on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the seventh president to die in office.


      He was a big fan of the Boston Red Sox baseball team. This was something instilled in him by his grandfather, Boston mayor John Francis Fitzgerald (aka "Honey Fitz"), who was himself a member of The Royal Rooters, a turn-of-the-century Red Sox fan club.


      His sister Jean Kennedy Smith was US ambassador to Ireland from June 1993-September 1998.


      His portrait appears on the US half-dollar coin.


      The street Rue John-F-Kennedy in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, is named in his honor.


      When he died in 1963 he left an estate estimated at $10 million, all of which derives from trust funds established by his father, Joseph P. Kennedy.


      PT 109--the boat that he commanded during World War II--was mentioned on more than one occasion on the television series, McHale's Navy (1962), Kennedy is referred to, but he is never mentioned by name. On at least one episode, however, PT 109 is seen backing out of the dock next to the one where McHale's PT boat is, although no one can be seen on it.


      He is mentioned in the lyrics of the songs "Killer Queen" by Queen, "Hey Manhattan!" by Prefab Sprout and "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy Joel.


      The Oscar-winning "High Hopes" (from A Hole in the Head (1959)) was Kennedy's official presidential campaign song.


      Uncle of Anthony Radziwill and Tina Radziwill.


      Considered his younger brother Robert F. Kennedy to be his top advisor and closest friend. Bobby similarly felt the same way about Jack and was "utterly devastated" by Jack's death in 1963. Friends and family said that, after his brother's death, Bobby was never the same man.


      Despite their later close bond, he and brother Robert F. Kennedy were not close growing up. This was due, in part, to the eight-year age difference between them. It was not until Jack, during his third term as a Massachusetts congressman, took a seven-week trip through the Far East and parts of the Middle East, and took Bobby (who had just graduated from law school) with him that they grew closer. During the trip the duo discovered their mutual similarities and forged the deep bond that would last until Jack's death. Jack appointed Bobby his campaign manager in 1952 and in 1960 he was reportedly so close to Bobby that while he was President he would often ask "Where's Bobby?" during important meetings, and would finally relax when Bobby showed up. For his part, Bobby's devout loyalty to Jack was often ridiculed and parodied by the media. Bobby, loving to poke fun at himself, often joked, "If I find the guy who says I'm too ruthless, I'll kill him".


      During his entire political career, he never once lost a single election.


      Journalist Jeff Greenfield (who later became a speech writer for Robert F. Kennedy) described Jack as "the guy who looked like your cool older brother".


      When he visited Ireland in late June 1963, he became the first sitting U.S. President to set foot on Irish soil.


      His 1953 marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy (then Jacqueline Bouvier) was celebrated at St. Mary's Church in Newport, RI, where more than 700 guests were in attendance. The couple later went to Hammersmith Farm overlooking Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island Sound), where a reception for 900 guests was lavishly catered. Best man at the wedding was Kennedy's brother Robert F. Kennedy. Among the ushers were Ted Kennedy, George A. Smathers and Sargent Shriver. Jacqueline's matron-of-honor was sister Lee Bouvier (aka Lee Radziwill).


      Only US President to predecease both his parents: (father) Joseph P. Kennedy (d. 18 November 1969); (mother) Rose Kennedy (d. 22 January 1995).


      Was the first Irish-American Catholic president (several previous presidents, none of whom were Catholic, had varying degrees of Irish-born ancestors).


      Was the first US President to be born in the 20th century.


      After the parade through Dallas, Kennedy was scheduled to attend a Texas barbecue and then spend the night at Vice President Lyndon Johnson's ranch. Johnson had organized a whip-cracking and sheep-herding demonstration for Kennedy's entertainment.


      The Kennedy assassination (Nov. 22, 1963) occurred on a Friday. The 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination (Nov. 22, 2013) also fell on a Friday.


      His great-grandfather, Patrick Kennedy, was a very poor Irish immigrant who emigrated to America in the fall of 1848. He fell sick from cholera and died in his Boston home on November 22, 1858, exactly 105 years to the day of JFK's assassination.


      His younger sister, Kathleen "Kick" Kennedy, married English politician and soldier William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, in the spring of 1944. This angered father Joseph P. Kennedy, who hated the idea of his Irish-American daughter marrying an English man.


      His older sister, 'Rosemary Kennedy', was born with learning deficits and had to be placed in alternative school. This shamed their father, Joseph P. Kennedy, who wanted all of his Kennedy children to be perfect in every way. In 1941 he forced Rosemary to undergo a lobotomy that went devastatingly wrong, causing her to become mentally incapacitated for the rest of her life.


      During the Cuban Missile Crisis he secretly agreed to remove US missiles from Turkey and Italy, and publicly announced that the United States would never invade Cuba again.


      He refused to provide air support for the Bay of Pigs invasion, even though Dwight D. Eisenhower had provided air support for the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat.


      He increased the number of American soldiers in South Vietnam, and tolerated an illegal coup d'état there on 1-2 November 1963.


      His official height was six foot, although Kennedy himself said he was 5'11".


      Has an airport named after him in New York.


      Pictured on a USA nondemoninated commemorative stamp issued 20 February 2017. Price on first day of issue was 49¢. The stamp was issued in sheets of 12; the sheet's selvage featured the official White House portrait painted by Aaron Shikler.


      Caused the Skybolt Crisis in December 1962 when he almost canceled the UK's nuclear deterrent, until being informed it would likely bring down Harold Macmillan's government.


      Over two thousand books has been written about the events surrounding his assassination.


      Personally ordered the Bay of Pigs invasion on 4 April 1961.


      The failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall, and a negotiated settlement between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement made Kennedy believe that another failure to stop Communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to "draw a line in the sand" and prevent a Communist victory in Vietnam.

      [6/26/63, speech in West Berlin, Germany] Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was "Civis Romanus sum". Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is "Ich bin ein Berliner".

      We shall do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless before the task or hopeless of its success. Confident and unafraid, we must labor on--not towards a strategy of annihilation but towards a strategy of peace.

      [1961] We are probably strong enough to prevent one nation from unleashing nuclear weapons on another. But we can't prevent infiltration, assassination, sabotage, bribery, any of the weapons of guerrilla warfare. One guerrilla can pin down 12 conventional soldiers, and we've got nothing equivalent.

      [1962, to Theodore Sorensen] If we solve the Berlin problem without war, Cuba will look pretty small. And if there is a war, Cuba won't matter much, either.


      Some people have their liberalism "made" by the time they reach their late 20s. I didn't. I was caught in crosscurrents and eddies. It was only later that I got into the stream of things.


      I must say, in defense of our own country, if the United States had not emphasized the military since 1945, the shape of the globe would be very different than it is today. So that those who feel that we overemphasize it might consider the fate of freedom if we had not emphasized it.


      [June 11, 1963] It is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this is the problem of one section of one country or another, or deplore the fact that we face. A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, than change, peaceful and constructive for all. Those who do nothing are inviting shame, as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right, as well as reality.


      [June 11, 1963] If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who will represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay?


      [1962] Too often in the past we have thought of the artist as an idler and dilettante and of the lover of arts as somehow sissy or effete. We have done both an injustice. The life of the artist is, in relation to his work, stern and lonely. He has labored hard, often among deprivation, to perfect his skill. He has turned aside from quick success in order to strip his vision of everything secondary or cheapening. His working life is marked by intense application and intense discipline. As for the lover of arts, it is he who, by subjecting himself to the sometimes disturbing experience of art, sustains the artist - and seeks only the reward that his life will, in consequence, be the more fully lived.


      It is only after you wield the powers of the presidency that you get hated. [Wayne Morse], [Jimmy Hoffa], Al Hayes, etc., all hate me now merely because of one bill. Presidents are bound to be hated unless they are as bland as [Dwight D. Eisenhower].


      [November 22, 1963, upon arriving in Dallas, Texas] We're really in nut country now.


      [March 1962] I sometimes think we are too much impressed by the clamor of daily events. Newspaper headlines and the television screens give us a short view . . . Yet it is the profound tendencies of history, and not the passing excitements, that will shape our future.


      [1960] Once you say you're going to settle for second that's what happens to you in life, I find.


      [on Inauguration Day, January 21, 1961] The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavour will light our country and all who serve it - and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.


      [on Inauguration Day, January 20, 1961] Together, let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.


      [to 49 Nobel Prize winners who came for dinner] This is the most extraordinary collection of talent that has ever gathered at the White House--with the possibility of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.


      We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or watch - we are going back from whence we came.


      We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. But I can't give up that territory to the Communists and get the American people to re-elect me.

About John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the USA


John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK, was the thirty-fifth President of the United States, serving from 1961 until his assassination in 1963.
After Kennedy's military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109 during World War II in the South Pacific, his aspirations turned political, with the encouragement and grooming of his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. Kennedy represented the state of Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat, and in the U.S. Senate from 1953 until 1960. Kennedy defeated then Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election, one of the closest in American history. To date, he is the only practicing Roman Catholic to be president. He was the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt), and the youngest elected to the office, at the age of 43. Kennedy is also the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize. Events during his administration include the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the building of the Berlin Wall, the Space Race, the African American Civil Rights Movement and early events of the Vietnam War.
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime and was murdered two days later by Jack Ruby before he could be put on trial. The Warren Commission and the 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that Oswald was the assassin, with the HSCA allowing for the probability of conspiracy. The event proved to be an important moment in U.S. history because of its impact on the nation and the ensuing political repercussions. Today, Kennedy continues to rank highly in public opinion ratings of former U.S. presidents.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
