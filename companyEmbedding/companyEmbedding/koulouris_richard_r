		Ralcorp: Personnel changes to help Post integration

		February 14, 2008
		- 
			by Eric Schroeder

Share This:







ST. LOUIS — Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. announced several personnel changes designed to facilitate the integration of Post cereals into Ralcorp, a move that is expected to be complete by the middle of this year.
Ronald D. Wilkinson, corporate vice-president and president of Bremner Food Group, Inc. and Nutcracker Brands, Inc., has been named corporate vice-president and president of Ralston Foods. In addition, Mr. Wilkinson will lead the integration efforts of Post cereal into Ralcorp. Once the integration is complete, the Post branded cereal division will report to David P. Skarie, co-chief executive officer and president of Ralcorp.
"We are confident that with 30 years of experience in the cereal industry, Ron Wilkinson is the right person to implement our plan to integrate the Post cereals operation into Ralcorp," Mr. Skarie said.
Succeeding Mr. Wilkinson as president of Bremner Food Group, Inc. and Nutcracker Brands, Inc., will be Richard R. Koulouris. Mr. Koulouris will continue as corporate vice-president and president of The Carriage House Companies, Inc., and also will have oversight for Ralcorp’s Medallian Foods business. He will report to Kevin J. Hunt, co-c.e.o. and president of Ralcorp.
"Rich Koulouris will use his 28 years of experience in the baking and snack categories to lead Bremner Food Group, Nutcracker and Medallion while maintaining his leadership over the Carriage House Companies," Mr. Hunt said.
The changes will take effect March 1.
