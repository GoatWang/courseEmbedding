Perkins Fund Marketing – Integrity, Leadership, Success

































































 


 

              Integrity, Leadership, Success
            
















 





In working with Perkins Fund Marketing to selectively grow our U.S. long/short hedge fund, we defined a very specific audience for asset raising--in particular, U.S.-based endowments and foundations and U.S.-based high net worth families. Perkins readily demonstrated that they had a deep knowledge of that audience and provided us with access to premier names within that market. 
		

- Mr. James Pallotta 
		

Chairman and CEO
Raptor Management
 
		










Perkins Fund Marketing exceeded our expectations in building a solid investor base.  Chip and his team were diligent, responsive, and very professional.  It was a pleasure to work with PFM. 
		

- Steve Hornstein  
		

Managing Member

The Perkins Fund Marketing team is a pleasure to work with.  Their professionals brought us a diverse and high quality mix of investors.  We believe their dedication and focus have been integral to our success. 
		

- Robert T. Hoffman 
		

Partner
Candlewood Capital Management LLC
 
		










Chip and his term at Perkins Fund Marketing are exceptionally adept and knowledgeable when it comes to sourcing fund managers that are of real interest to us.  Their understanding and deep relationships in the fund manager and allocator space alike make them one of the top capital placement firms in the industry.  Always professional, polished, and responsive. 
		

- Brian Reich 
		

President, Managing Partner
Atrato Advisors LLC
 
		










Perkins Fund Marketing is at the head of the class in third party marketing for hedge funds. Their due diligence is top flight, service is great and the information flow is excellent. 
		

- Brian Cornell 
		

Senior Managing Director, Advanced Strategies
Mesirow Financial
 
		










We at JL Squared analyze hundreds of hedge funds each year, on behalf of our clients, in search of the most compelling investment opportunities.  We appreciate the work Perkins does upfront to source competitive and  experienced managers with strong risk management for us to consider.  We have been an investor and look forward to what comes next. 
		

- Jonathan R. Ligget, CFA 
		

Partner and Chief Investment Officer
JL Squared Group
 
		










We engaged Perkins Fund Marketing to leverage an external team of experienced marketing professionals with broad investor contacts. Chip and his team invested the necessary time becoming familiar with our business, personnel and processes before reaching out to investor prospects. Once the PFM team started to introduce our fund to a wide range of investors, we conducted numerous high-quality meetings. Chip and his team performed everything asked of them and contributed to significant growth of our fund during its initial years. 
		

- Mr. Philip Garthe 
		

COO
HG Vora Capital Management, LLC

 
		










I have worked with PFM as a fund manager and as an allocator.  They have been superb to work with in both roles. They are thoughtful, diligent, insightful, friendly and, unlike many firms, they listen. The team at PFM is great to work with and they get results.

OURHISTORYPerkins Fund Marketing was founded in 1997, in Southport, Connecticut to provide comprehensive and effective marketing and sales in the alternative investment and long only arenas. Chip Perkins saw a niche for a smart, focused firm that could do more than merely connect managers and investors.
