      Outdoor Gear Retailers in the World




Deal Positions Camping World for Expanded e-Commerce Growth and 
      Customer Reach




                    	July 27, 2017 08:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH) (“Camping World”), the nation’s 
      largest network of RV-centric retail locations, today announced to 
      purchase TheHouse.com, an online retailer specializing in bikes, 
      sailboards, skateboards, wakeboards, snowboards and outdoor gear.
    
“This new acquisition, coupled with Overtons.com and 
      GanderOutdoors.com, continues our effort to grow our understanding of 
      the outdoor enthusiast and furthers our strategy of continuing to 
      diversify both in activity and demographic of our Good Sam Club member.”

      The acquisition will build on and complement the significant foundation 
      already in place to serve customers across the Camping World RV 
      SuperCenter network and positions the company for even faster e-commerce 
      growth in the future by expanding customer reach and adding new product 
      offerings. Camping World recently acquired certain assets of Gander 
      Mountain, a leader in the hunting, fishing, camping, and outdoor gear 
      market and Overton’s, which features boating and marine accessories.
    

      “We believe this acquisition of the online retailer, TheHouse.com, 
      continues our focus of an omni channel approach”, said Marcus Lemonis, 
      Chairman of Camping World. “The management team not only possess a 
      strong knowledge of the active sports market but also has a keen eye for 
      the development and invention of products. This vertical strategy not 
      only provides for a nice bolt on to the company but enhances the renewed 
      strategy behind the new Gander Outdoors model.”
    

      Camping World and TheHouse.com will maintain distinct brands, with 
      Camping World focusing on the outdoor camping and RV industry, while 
      TheHouse.com will continue to provide a unique experience for the active 
      outdoor lifestyles.
    

      Lemonis continued, “This new acquisition, coupled with Overtons.com and 
      GanderOutdoors.com, continues our effort to grow our understanding of 
      the outdoor enthusiast and furthers our strategy of continuing to 
      diversify both in activity and demographic of our Good Sam Club member.

 LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CWH) (“Camping World”), the nation’s
      largest network of RV-centric retail locations and only provider of a
      comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and
      resources for the outdoor enthusiast, announced the planned acquisition
      of certain assets of Gander Mountain Company and Overton’s, Inc.
    

      On April 28, 2017, Camping World was chosen as the winning bidder at a
      bankruptcy auction for certain assets of Gander Mountain and its
      Overton’s boating business. Simultaneously, a group of liquidators was
      chosen as the winning bidder to be retained as the agent for Gander
      Mountain to conduct liquidation sales at substantially all of Gander
      Mountain’s existing stores. Pursuant to Camping World’s winning bid,
      Camping World will purchase the Overton’s inventory for an amount equal
      to cost, which as of the date of the auction was approximately
      $15,600,000, plus $22,150,000 for certain other assets, such as the
      right to designate any real estate leases for assignment to Camping
      World or other third parties, other agreements Camping World elects to
      assume, intellectual property rights, operating systems and platforms,
      certain distribution center equipment, the Gander Mountain and Overton’s
      ecommerce business, and fixtures and equipment for the Overton’s retail
      and corporate operations. Camping World will also assume certain
      liabilities, such as cure costs for leases and other agreements it
      elects to assume, accrued time off for employees retained by Camping
      World and retention bonuses payable to certain key Gander Mountain
      employees. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
      Minnesota will consider the approval of the Camping World winning bid
      and the liquidators winning bid at a sale hearing that is currently
      scheduled for May 3, 2017 at 1:30 p.m.


Marcus Lemonis, Chairman and CEO of Camping World, stated, “the Gander
      Mountain and Overton customer and their affinity to the outdoor
      lifestyle are the perfect complement to our Camping World business. The
      structure of our deal provides much flexibility and will not only allow
      us to refine the inventory selection and select only those stores which
      are profitable or we believe have a clear path to profitability, but
      will also allow us to immediately offer our comprehensive portfolio of
      services, protection plans, products and resources to the existing
      Gander Mountain and Overton customer base and in stores in which we
      elect to operate. While we are obligated to assume a minimum of
      seventeen leases, our designation rights will allow us to operate stores
      and retain employees at a number to maximize profitability.”
    

      The structure of the transaction will allow Camping World to immediately
      operate the Overton’s business as a going concern upon closing the
      transaction this month and the liquidators to immediately commence the
      sale of Gander Mountain inventory at Gander Mountain locations. Lemonis
      added, “the liquidation of the existing Gander Mountain inventory will
      allow us to start with a clean slate of what we consider the appropriate
      mix and level of inventory, including the addition of Camping World and
      Overton offerings where appropriate, and our lease designation rights
      will allow us to select only those stores in appropriate locations with
      appropriate cost structures.”
    

Brent Moody, Chief Operating Officer of Camping World, stated, “Camping
      World’s plan is to immediately right size the inventory and operate only
      in retail locations with occupancy costs that we believe support
      profitable operations, with an extreme focus on corporate overhead and
      expenses, consistent with our other operating segments.”

 Learn About RV Types & Classes







Motorhome




Towable RV













Class A








Class B








Class C






Class A RVs are the largest motorhomes. They provide plenty of room for you to comfortably take your family and all of your supplies on the road.


Class B RVs are typically built on a van chassis, their small size provides better gas mileage than other motorhomes. They offer excellent maneuverability and can even fit into most garages and parking spaces.


Built on a truck chassis, Class C RVs are easily distinguished by the overhang over the driver’s seat which can be used as an extra bed or storage area. They are available in shorter to longer lengths.

RV Type Descriptions









TRAVEL TRAILER  The most common towable for your camping needs, travel trailers come in a wide variety of floor plans, range from 15 to nearly 40 feet in length and can sleep from 2 to 10 people.












FIFTH WHEEL  Fifth wheels utilize an in-bed hitch (aka ‘fifth wheel’) embedded in a half-ton or larger truck. With higher ceilings and more space, they will luxuriously accommodate you and your family. They sleep from 4 to 10 people.












TOYHAULER  Toyhaulers have garages to haul bikes, motorcycles and/or ATVs. They come in both travel trailer and fifth wheel versions.












POP UP  These lightweight campers are ideal for a smaller towing vehicle. Pop Ups fold down for easy towing and storage and can generally sleep from 4 to 6 people.












TRUCK CAMPER  Set directly into the bed of a truck, truck campers accommodate 2 to 4 people. Popular with those who want to tow watercraft with their RV.












CLASS A GAS  Class A RVs are the largest motorhomes, they range from 20 feet to more than 40 feet. There are many floor plan options available for a Class A.












CLASS A DIESEL  Also called diesel pushers (the engine is in the back), Class A diesels come in lengths from nearly 30 feet to 45 feet. The diesel engine makes them ideal for towing heavy cargo or vehicles. Also ideal for travel in the mountains.












CLASS B  Typically built on a van chassis, Class B RVs provide better gas mileage than other motorhomes. They offer excellent maneuverability and can fit into most garages.












CLASS C  Class C RVs are built on a truck chassis and are easily distinguished by the overhang over the cabin which is used as an extra bed or storage area. They are available from 20 feet to over 30 feet.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
