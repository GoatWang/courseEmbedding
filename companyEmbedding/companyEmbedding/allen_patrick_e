Silverstone boss Patrick Allen has described Formula One a 's*** product' in a highly critical attack on the sport.Silverstone, the home of grand prix racing in Britain, faces an uncertain future after the sport's chief executive Bernie Ecclestone revealed that their £16million race fee for this year's event has been deferred to 2016.The annual fee, which increases by five per cent each year in their contract which runs through until 2026, could cripple the famous circuit.  





 Silverstone managing director Patrick Allen described Formula One as a 's*** product' in a critical attack  





 Lewis Hamilton celebrates with Formula One fans after winning the 2015 British Grand Prix at SilverstoneAnd despite attracting a sell-out crowd of more than 120,000 fans earlier this year, Silverstone managing director Allen believes the sport is becoming increasingly difficult to sell - a topic he has broached with Ecclestone.'Months and months back I said it to Mr E himself that I can't sell tickets for a s*** product,' Allen is quoted as saying in the Independent.'Fans don't want to see a procession. As a promoter I can only promote what you give me and if that isn't up to standard, people aren't going to buy.'

Allen added: 'I've said that people don't come to watch guys looking at data screens. Fans want to see gladiators racing and fighting it out in a fair fight.'Nobody wants to hear drivers getting told to "lift", "coast" or "we're not going to catch the guy in front, settle for second".'I think it is criminal when we have got to that state of racing and that is not saleable. I think Bernie is as frustrated with it as we all are.  





 Bernie Ecclestone (pictured) admits Formula One could be under new ownership before the end of the year'How long is it before the technical director is stood on the top step, not the driver? You've just got to throw the towel in then and look for something else.'Allen's comments ahead of this week's Russian Grand Prix come after Ecclestone claimed the sport could be under new ownership by the end of the year.It was reported over the summer that CVC Capital Partners, the private equity firm which has owned F1 for the last 10 years, was in talks with a US-Qatari bid to sell its 35.5 per cent controlling stake, while Ecclestone confirmed he would sell his five per cent stake as part of any deal.






  





 Silverstone (where Hamilton is pictured in July) pays five per cent more to host the Grand Prix each yearAnd when asked on Tuesday about those negotiations, the 84-year-old told the Camp Beckenbauer Global Summit in Austria: 'There has been a lot of interest and I would say there are three parties at the moment where I would be surprised if one of them did not buy them (the shares) shortly.'Quizzed on what kind of timeframe in which he would expect to see a new owner in F1, Ecclestone said: 'This year.'

Formula One slammed as ‘not saleable’ and a 's*** product' by Silverstone boss Patrick Allen

Patrick Allen critical of sport based on data where the drivers are told to ‘coast’ or ‘settle for second’ 



Christian Sylt

Wednesday 7 October 2015 20:17 BST







Click to followThe Independent Online















 
        Lewis Hamilton won the 2015 British Grand Prix earlier this year Getty Images 




The boss of Silverstone, the home of the British Grand Prix, has launched a stinging attack on the state of Formula One, saying that the sport has turned into a procession which is “not saleable” and is a “s*** product”.
A sell-out crowd of 140,000 may have watched Lewis Hamilton cruise to victory at this year’s British Grand Prix – but the manner of his victories at that and other races is unlikely to woo new fans, argues Patrick Allen, the managing director of the Northamptonshire circuit. 


Months and months back I said it to Mr E himself that I can’t sell tickets for a s*** product


Patrick Allen, Silverstone managing director


“Fans don’t want to see a procession,” Allen told The Independent. “As a promoter I can only promote what you give me and if that isn’t up to standard, people aren’t going to buy.” He said he had already addressed his concerns to F1’s chief Bernie Ecclestone.
“Months and months back I said it to Mr E himself that I can’t sell tickets for a s*** product,” Allen added on the eve of this weekend’s Russian Grand Prix. 
“I’ve said that people don’t come to watch guys looking at data screens. Fans want to see gladiators racing and fighting it out in a fair fight. Nobody wants to hear drivers getting told to ‘lift’, ‘coast’ or ‘we’re not going to catch the guy in front, settle for second’. 
“I think it is criminal when we have got to that state of racing and that is not saleable. I think Bernie is as frustrated with it as we all are. How long is it before the technical director is stood on the top step, not the driver? You’ve just got to throw the towel in then and look for something else.”
Bernie Ecclestone (right) with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi
Hamilton currently has a 48-point lead in the championship, as the F1 roadshow heads to Russia this weekend with the aim of spreading the gospel further afield. He has won seven other races including last weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix, where Mercedes got just six minutes of television coverage as Hamilton’s race was so flawless and uneventful. Allen says that F1 should perhaps look back to its early days or take its lead from its two-wheeled equivalent, the motorcycling championship MotoGP.
“I’m massively into F1 and used to race bikes. If you compare F1 to MotoGP, they are changing lead every few minutes, there are at least three or four guys that are going to do well. The Brits can do well in it. It is exciting stuff to watch. 
“In my opinion you should probably get flag-to-flag racing back into F1. You go out with a tank of fuel and once you’re out there you’re gone until the second flag drops. The Stirling Moss days. Do away with pit stops. Once you’re out there you’re on your own mate, and you’re not allowed to communicate at all. You go back to using your pit board.”
Allen is right in thinking that Ecclestone believes that F1 is a tough sell. “It is hard enough today, forget Formula One, for anybody to sell things unless they are top of the range, and unfortunately our product isn’t,” Ecclestone admitted when approached by The Independent.
Felipe Massa leads the 2015 British Grand Prix at Silverstone
Hamilton’s dominance on the track and his jet-set lifestyle have made him a huge star but Ecclestone said the public still want less predictable racing.
“Lewis gets attention this year because it’s new, it’s a novelty. Wait until this year is gone and the public say, ‘I wonder what is going to happen? Are we going to have another year like last year? Hamilton is going to go rushing off.’ People want a race.”
Allen’s attack has added to the uncertainty surrounding Silverstone and the future of the British Grand Prix, which is in doubt following the recent revelation that it is struggling to pay the £16m hosting fee, despite managing to attract a sell-out crowd.
The track has a contract to host the British Grand Prix until 2026 but is suffering after losing rental income from selling a lease on 280 acres of land two years ago to clear its debts. This previously plugged the difference between the increase in ticket sales every year and the five per cent annual rise in the race hosting fee. Silverstone’s plight has led to it paying the hosting fee for the British race in arrears and Ecclestone has the right to terminate the contract next year.
Hamilton’s performance has been driven by new V6 engines which were introduced to F1 last year and were mastered by his Mercedes team. Ecclestone has been one of the fiercest critics of the engines and some observers have interpreted this as him talking down F1.
While Ecclestone’s criticisms may seem counter-intuitive, they make more sense when F1’s byzantine structure is taken into account. The rules are made by the governing body, the FIA, while Ecclestone runs the company which commercialises the sport. 
In a nutshell, Ecclestone sells a product which is made by the FIA so his business suffers if it isn’t up to scratch. As do the race promoters.

Memories of serving with with Pat in BUNKER HILL will always be fondly remembered.  He was an inspirational leader and a man of genuine character. Our thoughts, prayers, and condolences to his family.  May he rest in peace and may his loved ones find comfort. Such a great loss.

Karen, I am so saddened to hear of your loss. Captain Allen was such an inspirational mentor and the greatest leader I have served with. I remember the many lessons he taught me, as I made so many mistakes as his "fill-in Chief Engineer" on Port Royal. In his typical fashion, he patiently led me to the answers and mentored me to success despite my best efforts. His lessons have stuck with me throughout my time as a leader.

Karen, I am so saddened to hear of your loss.  Captain Allen was such an inspirational mentor and the greatest leader I have served with.

In his typical fashion, he patiently led me to the answers and mentored me to success despite my best efforts.  His lessons have stuck with me throughout my time as a leader.  I remember convincing him to make a port call in Cabo San Lucas, nudging him with an opportunity to go on a fishing trip with my father's client who lived there.  What a great day that was, and he smiled the whole time, even reeled in a Marlin if I remember correctly.  Fond memories, and surely you have many.  My family prays for yours and he will be sorely missed by many.Fair winds and following seas shipmate.De Oppresso Liber,

Dear Karen,Steve & I were deeply saddened by the news of Pat's untimely death. He was such a great man, husband, father and Naval officer, always giving his all. We will never forget the fun times we had with you and Pat in Yokosuka, and of course baby sitting Tracey and Richard. Heaven welcomed a special angel on May 29th.May God's love comfort you and help you find peace and healing in the days to come.~Steve & Amy Larsen

Karen - Pam and I were shocked and deeply saddened to hear or Pat's death. A truly remarkable man who made the hard things look easy and always achieved more than you expected he could. He was a key reason morale was so high on Bunker Hill and the ship was so successful. It was so great to see him get 3 ship commands during his career - how happy his crews must have been.We remember fondly our times together

He was a key reason morale was so high on Bunker Hill and the ship was so successful.  It was so great to see him get 3 ship commands during his career - how happy his crews must have been.We remember fondly our times together in Japan - from the dog running loose in the airport to the fun times in Yokosuka.  Pat was always an instigator of having fun while doing an outstanding job.  You are in our prayers for comfort at this very difficult time.  We will be further in touch.....  May God bless you and all your family.

I hope there is a golf course in heaven because I know you will be on it.  We have been proud of you for your entire career.  Little brother, you will be in our hearts forever.  God bless you with fair winds and following seas.

Having served with Pat in the Navy, I have always considered him a role model, mentor and friend.  He was truly a special leader and every place that he served was better when he left.  you always felt more positive after a conversation, watch at sea or liberty on the beach with Pat--he truly made a difference.  Jo Brooke and my thoughts and prayers are with all of you. Love, The Nowells
