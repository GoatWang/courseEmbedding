	ITEM 1.01




	ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT






	On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange) with Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp., a California corporation (PSPC), whereby the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PSPC, in exchange for Thirty Million (30,000,000) restricted shares of the Companys common stock. Accordingly, PSPC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the business direction of the Company has shifted to the business of PSPC, as discussed in detail in Section 5.6 of this Current Report.





	The foregoing description of the Share Exchange is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof, which is filed as 10.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.






	ITEM 2.01




	COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

	Exemption from Registration

	. The shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the Share Exchange, shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering, or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, or Regulation S for offers and sales of securities outside the United States. The Share Exchange is an exempt transaction pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as the share exchange was a private transaction by the Company and did not involve any public offering. Additionally, we relied upon the exemption afforded by Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act which is a safe harbor for the private offering exemption of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act whereby an issuer may sell its securities to an unlimited number of accredited investors, as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D. Further, we relied upon the safe harbor provision of Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Securities Act which permits offers or sales of securities by the Company outside of the United States that are not made to U.S. persons or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person, as that term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S.

	FORM 10 DISCLOSURE








	ITEM 1.




	BUSINESS








	Our Corporate History and Background







	Yanex Group, Inc. was founded in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010, as an early stage company operating within the concept architectural, interior design project and related areas in Germany initially. Our plan was to operate in various architectural fields and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas. Also, we intended to work with interior design view, visualization and renderings. After attempting to implement our business plan, we have determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to seek out and identify potential acquisition partners, joint ventures or other strategic alliances.





	Accordingly, on June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange) with Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp., a California corporation (PSPC), whereby the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PSPC, in exchange for Thirty Million (30,000,000) restricted shares of the Companys common stock. Accordingly, PSPC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the business direction of the Company has shifted to the business of PSPC. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization transaction, given the fact that the Company held no net monetary assets at the date of the merger transaction. As PSPC is deemed to be the purchaser for accounting purposes under recapitalization accounting, these pro forma financial statements are presented as a continuation of PSPC.  The equity of PSPC is presented as the equity of the combined company and the capital stock account of PSPC is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding and issued common stock of the legal acquirer (Yanex) after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the Share Exchange Agreement.






	Who We Are:






	Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on June 27, 2001.





	PSPCs primary source of revenue comes from the repair and rental of power wheelchairs and scooters. PSPC deals with federal, state and private insurance providers such as Medicare, Medi-Cal, Nevada Care and Blue Cross among several others. PSPC has very limited dealings with non-insured cash patients. We have tangible assets comprised of company delivery vehicles, loaner wheelchairs, office equipment and furniture. Inventory is purchased on an as needed basis, typically when patients/customers are approved for coverage by their insurance provider. Intangible assets comprise of its current patient list and working relationships with the various insurance providers who refer their clients to us for their repair and rental needs.









	PSPC was awarded a contract by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services that begins on July 1, 2016 and expires on December 31, 2108. The contract requires PSPC to furnish certain items of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) under the Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program.






	Competitive Advantages







	We qualify as a small supplier as defined by the Medicare competitive bidding program which we feel increases our changes of being awarded winning bids in the upcoming recompete rounds. Regulations stipulate that if 30% of winning companies do not fall under the small supplier category then more small suppliers must be added in essence making our changes one in three or better. We are able to meet our service standards by buying product only on an as needed basis. This prevents PSPC from having to output cash before a purchase order is made.







	All patients are pre-qualified before products are ordered and as such there is a low risk of non-payment. When the insurance provider refuses payment it is typically due to an error on the part of the staff in entering and/or submitting the claim. Upon re-entry the claim is typically successful.









	Although we do a majority of our purchases from three different suppliers due to better-negotiated prices, we are able to buy the parts and products needed from various local and out of state suppliers.

	Repair Sales Cycle






	Our typical repair cycle is as follows:





	1.


	Patient lead


	i.


	New patient referral is sent to PSPC


	ii.


	Current patient is called


	iii.


	Current patient calls in


	iv.


	New patient is obtained


	2.


	Patient information is gathered and insurance coverage eligibility is verified


	3.


	Upon verification a repair technician calls the patient for a preliminary telephone diagnosis


	4.


	Based on the repairs the technician believes is needed, a second eligibility check is done to confirm the patient qualifies for those specific repairs


	5.


	The office manager confirms a date and time range with the patient for the technician to pick up the equipment


	6.


	Routing information is passed on to the repair technician


	7.


	Repair technician sanitizes and loads a loaner wheelchair based on the patients specific needs and criteria


	8.


	Repair technician drops off the loaner chair, picks up the patients equipment and fills out the necessary paperwork


	9.


	The equipment is brought to the warehouse for a thorough diagnosis and forwarded to the office manager


	i.


	If is typical upon full diagnostic testing the technician finds other parts in need of replacement or repair


	10.


	Eligibility is ran for a third and final time to confirm insurance coverage including any new parts that may be needed


	11.


	The patient is contacted by the office manager to confirm the repairs that will be done and timeframe for expected delivery


	12.


	Upon complete repair of the equipment:


	i.


	Head technician does a final inspection on the equipment


	ii.


	The paperwork is forwarded to the office manager to setup a date and time frame for equipment drop off


	13.


	Paperwork is forwarded to the billing department for processing


	14.


	The patients equipment is sanitized and prepared for delivery


	15.


	The equipment is delivered to the patient, the loaner is picked up and paperwork is filled by the patient


	16.


	The loaner equipment is returned to the warehouse, sanitized and stored






	Operating Systems and Controls







	PSPC currently uses a combination of software for the daily business operations. The main billing and patient information software is being phased out and being be replaced by a more current software. We expect the new software to help reduce paper, redundancies, man-hours, mistakes and the potential loss of data while increasing the security of patients information. Our billing process will also be more efficient as secondary payers will be processed automatically and triggered at the earliest possible moment.











	Growth Strategy






	The dollar amount and frequency companies are allowed to bill patients and their insurance providers is set by Medicare and therefore our competitors in the same product categories must charge the same price. Margins can be increased by processing more patients and decreasing costs. PSPC has the ability to process more patients without increase overhead and labor cost. Additionally,

	PSPC

	intends to advertise its billing services to other medical companies around the country. Companies in the durable medical equipment industry use standard Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) in order to submit their invoices electronically to the insurance providers. Other companies can benefit from not needing in-house billing by hiring PSPC to process their payments for a rate of 3-5% of the revenue.








	Competitive Bidding Area (CBA)






	Since

	PSPC

	does not currently hold a winning bid for one of the competitive bidding (as further explained below) areas (CBAs) it has the potential to significantly increase revenues by doing so. PSPC will also benefit from lower cost of goods because of the expected increase in volume. There are several criteria used to determine a companys qualification and more than one company can awarded an area and product. We plan to aggressively target products, such as catheters, that dont fall under CBA in the areas currently serviced of Southern California and Las Vegas.








	Page 5 of 25











	Current Working Relationships






	We employ several strategies to increase its revenue. One approach is to increase the referrals from the insurance providers by building relationships based on positive patient feedback. Insurance providers will refer a maximum of patients at any given time equivalent to the number of loaner equipment in stock. For example, by us having 120 loaner power wheelchairs in stock each provider will refer up to 120 patients at a given time.








	Current Patient Database






	A patient qualifies for repairs on their power wheelchair or scooter every six months to one year depending on the part that is in need of repair or replacing and a brand new power wheelchair every five years. The patient database is constantly being contacted to arrange for repair upon a prior successful eligibility check.











	Intellectual Property










	We have no patents or trademarks or applications pending.










	Government Regulations








	Numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations, including the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology For Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively HIPAA), govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and disclosure of patients individually-identifiable health information. As part of our provision of, and billing for, health care equipment and services, we are required to collect and maintain such protected patient-identifiable health information. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action, state legislative actions or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health care related data and communicate with payers. Moreover, the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. While we believe we comply in all material respects with HIPAA, and comparable state privacy and security requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of these regulations. Sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties. A violation could subject us to penalties, fines or possible exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.







	The federal government has made a policy decision to significantly increase the financial resources allocated to enforcing the health care fraud and abuse laws. Private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny of health care claims in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices in the health care area.










	Medicare and Medicaid








	As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, Congress enacted the Medicare program, which provides for hospital, physician and other statutorily defined health benefits for qualified individuals, including persons 65 and older and the disabled. The Medicaid program, also established by Congress in 1965, is a joint federal and state program that provides certain statutorily-defined health benefits to financially needy individuals who are blind, disabled, aged or members of families with dependent children.







	Under existing Medicare laws and regulations, the sale and rental of our products is generally reimbursed by the Medicare program according to prescribed fee schedule amounts calculated using statutorily-prescribed formulas. Significant legislation affecting home medical equipment (HME) reimbursement has been signed into law, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA), the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), the Medicare, Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and changes to these programs and acts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.









	Page 6 of 25











	Competitive Bidding Area (CBA)






	The Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services.





	Under the program, a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted. Suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products. Not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding. Bids are submitted electronically through a web-based application process and required documents are mailed. Bids are evaluated based on the suppliers eligibility, its financial stability and the bid price. Contracts are awarded to the Medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards. Contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount. The amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item.





	The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is required by law to recompete contracts under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program at least once every three years. The Round 2 and national mail-order program contract periods expire on June 30, 2016. The federal government awards contracts to companies in the durable medical equipment (DME) industry upon a successful bid to service the specific areas and products. Winners of bid reserve the right service the competitive bidding areas (CBAs) for a period of two years. After the two year period the contract holders lose their rights and the CBA all interested DME companies as requested to submit a bid.





	PSPC does not currently hold a winning bid and has submitted a bid for Round 2 Recompete.








	The Anti-Kickback Statute







	Due to high fraud in the industry, companies such as ours that operate within the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to strict fraud and abuse laws often referred to as the Anti-Kickback statute. At the federal level, the Anti-Kickback statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing any remuneration, including a bribe, kickback or rebate, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referral of patients, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs. Federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government, including Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Violations of the Anti-Kickback statute may result in civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to $25,000 per violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs.









	CHAP Accreditation







	We are voluntarily part of the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) which is an industry recognized accreditation meeting high standards covering compliance requirements as prescribed by state and federal bodies. Payers and patients appreciated CHAP as a non-biased third-party approval of the company in the industry. CHAP also keeps PSPC up-to-date with regulatory changes and provides ongoing education to staff to familiarize themselves on how to stay in compliance.












	Page 7 of 25












	Competition







	We operated in a highly competitive industry with few national competitors and several local, small and medium sized businesses. Our biggest competitor is Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. which has local national offices. Local competitors include Lincoln Medical and Westview Medical.






	Management believes that the number of competitors will decrease over the long run because of decreasing profit margins due to the competitive bidding programs implemented by the government. The nature of the competitive bidding encourages lower prices therefore forcing some companies out of businesses.







	Employees







	As of January 1, 2016, we have 13 full time employees. Our employees are not currently represented by a labor union of labor organization. These employees are spread out into various departments, including management, billing, sales and repair. The billing, sales and management are headquartered out of Rancho Cucamonga, CA, while Anaheim, CA serves as repair facilities with limited staff.





	The Las Vegas office is the headquarters for Nevada as well as it serves as a repair facility. Anaheim and Las Vegas each have outside sales staff. All locations are required to be staffed for a minimum number of hours a week as required by state laws.





	The sales department includes outside and inside sales people. Outside sales people host fall prevention seminars in order to generate leads. The seminars are held at care facilities and during the presentation the repair technician provides equipment cleaning and onsite repair at no cost.






	ITEM 1A.




	RISK FACTORS







	You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. We believe these risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our results and business operations.









	Risks Associated with Our Business







	 






	We rely on contract manufacturing of our products. Our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements, or failures by our contractors to perform, could harm our sales and reputation.




	 


	We source our products from third-party manufacturers. As a result, we must locate and secure products that meet our demands. We depend on our manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity. We do not have material long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers, and these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. Our dependence on contract manufacturers could subject us to a number of risks if these manufacturers do not meet our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements or if they fail to materially perform, any of which could seriously harm our sales and reputation. Further, if we need to place greater demands on our current manufacturers due to increased customer demands, or seek additional or replacement manufacturers, we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.




	 






	Violation of labor laws and practices by our manufacturers and suppliers could harm our business.




	 


	We require our manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While the Company promotes ethical business practices, we do not control our manufacturers or suppliers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our manufacturers or suppliers, or divergence of their labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the local markets, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings.

	A privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationship with our customers, expose the Company to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.




	 


	As part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential patients/customer information. Despite security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose the Company to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business.









	Information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm.








	The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.







	We use electronic information technology (IT) in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets. Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our IT systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.








	Medicare Regulations







	Medicare regulations and bylaws have a pattern of changing every two to four years. Changes typically include what equipment is covered by insurance, what percentage of the equipment is covered and what dollar amount Medicare will cover on behalf of the patient. Changes in Federal government also have an impact on the industry because different governments have shown to allot different budgets for the industry. Any unforeseen change in these regulation could have a negative impact on our business. The Medicare industry is heavily regulated by state and federal rules and law and as such the Company is subject to regular inspections and audits and needs to maintain compliance. Employees are subject to laws and regulations as well being governed by ethics and standards of conduct and violations can result in severe penalties.







	We may be subject to sanction under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)







	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) governs the collection, dissemination, security, use and disclosure of patients individually-identifiable health information. As part of our regular business activity we are required to collect and store such information. Sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties and could result in fines or possible exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.





	We transitioned to new web based software in March 2015. The new software is HIPAA compliant and will be used for recording, transmitting and storing billing as well as patient information. Using the new software will relieve the Company of some of the compliance responsibilities specifically the storage and transmission of sensitive information.











	Page 9 of 25












	Reliance on the Internet







	Our operations depend heavily on our access to our billing software which is completely Internet based. Failure to be able to connect to the Internet would cause disruptions in our business including the inability to obtain new patients, loss of existing patients and delay in revenue collection.









	Potential Decreasing Profit Margins







	The reimbursement amounts offered by state and federal governments may decrease in the upcoming years due to tightening federal and state budgets. This could lead to decreases in price due to the competitive bidding program set forth by the federal government.









	Write Off of Intangible Assets







	Our intangible assets are evaluated every quarter for impairment of value. If management determines that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to write-off the impaired portion of the unamortized intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.









	Our Success relies on our continued relationships with physicians







	Our success, in part, is dependent upon referrals and our ability to maintain good relations with physicians and other referral sources. Physicians and other medical personnel that refer patients to us are not our employees, and are free to refer their patients to our competitors. If we are unable to successfully cultivate new referral sources and maintain strong relationships with our current referral sources, then our revenues may decline.









	Inadequate Insurance Coverage







	Participants in the health care industry, including us, are subject to substantial claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business, often involving large claims and significant defense costs. As a result of the liability risks inherent in our lines of business we maintain liability insurance intended to cover such claims. Our insurance policies are subject to annual renewal. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate, and we may not be able to obtain liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we have been advised by our insurance broker that our insurance premiums will be subject to increases in the future, which increases may be material. Furthermore, the losses that are insured through commercial insurance are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies. While we believe our commercial insurance providers are currently credit worthy, there can be no assurance that such insurance companies will remain so in the future. Inadequate insurance coverage limits, increases in our insurance costs or losses suffered due to one or more of our insurance carriers defaulting on their obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.









	Potential Litigation







	The nature of our business subjects us to investigations and litigation in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we are from time to time involved in other legal proceedings. While management does not believe that any lawsuit we are a party to, if resolved adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, investigations and litigation could arise in the future which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and profitability.









	Lack of diversification







	PSPC has diversification with patients but not products. Since the Company is focused on a specific part of the Medicare industry, a hard change by the government would result in a large decrease in revenue. For example, if Medicare were to stop allowing repairs of power wheelchairs.









	Proposed changes by the government







	We are aware that the Federal government is considering changing the procedure to require companies in the industry to get authorization before starting the repair. Currently the industry standard to confirm coverage, proceed with the repair and it is expected that payment will follow. The governments purpose is to cut down on fraudulent billing.


	Any change in the current procedures could have a negative impact on our business.






	Page 10 of 25












	Barriers to Expansion







	Being in a heavily regulated industry there is a complicated process to setup new facilities and different states have different requirements. Some states, such as Nevada, required

	PSPC

	to have a full functioning and staffed facility before starting the licensing process. The permits and licenses took 13 months which cost the Company 13 months of overhead without the ability generate income.








	Business disruptions could affect our operating results









	A significant portion of our development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.







	Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities



	 





	We do not currently have a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.









	We do not currently have a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. We are not currently required to file reports under Section 13(a) or under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and are a considered a voluntary filer with respect to the reports we do file under those sections. We will not be required to file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act until the earlier to occur of (i) our registration of a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, which would be required if we list a class of securities on a national securities exchange or if we meet the size requirements set forth in Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, or which we may voluntarily elect to undertake at an earlier date, or (ii) the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to our common stock. However, until we become subject to the reporting requirements under either Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we expect that we will voluntarily file the reports that we would be required to file if we were subject to those sections.








	Our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders.




	 


	The stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, and the market prices of companies listed on the OTC quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed, have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:





	·


	variations in our operating results;


	·


	changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;


	·


	changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry;


	·


	additions or departures of key personnel; and


	·


	future sales of our common stock.


	 


	Domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.







	Our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices, or at all.







	We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained. Although the trading volume of our common shares increased significantly recently, it has historically been sporadically or thinly-traded meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at certain given time may be relatively small or non-existent.






	Page 11 of 25










	This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company, which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stockbrokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons, those persons tend to be risk-averse and may be reluctant to follow, purchase, or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.







	The market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses to you.







	Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.







	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders.







	We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future, it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings after paying the interest for the preferred stock, if any, to implement our business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future.


	 




	Volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation.







	The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources.







	The elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.







	Our Articles of Incorporation contains a specific provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to our company and shareholders. Further, we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders.


	 






	Page 12 of 25













	Our sole officer and director owns approximately 90% of our shares after the offering that permits her to exert influence over us or to prevent a change of control.








	Our sole director and officer, Ms. Michelle Rico, will beneficially own approximately 90% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of this stock ownership, Ms. Michelle Rico will continue to influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws, and the approval of significant corporate transactions. This consolidation of voting power could also delay, deter or prevent a change of our control that might be otherwise beneficial to shareholders.







	Our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.




	 


	Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and FINRA, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.

	Operating Revenues




	 




	Three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015







	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we earned revenues of $343,212 compared to revenues of $311,751 during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Our gross profit during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $314,491 compared to $208,371 during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  







	Year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014







	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we earned revenues of $881,442 compared to revenues of $947,993 during the year ended December 31, 2014.   Our gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $694,295 compared to $689,642 during the year ended December 31, 2014.


	 




	Operating Expenses and Net Loss




	 




	Three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015







	We incurred operating expenses of $165,403 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to $215,045 during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  The decrease is due to the fact that we were more efficient in our operating costs compared to the prior year.  Our net income during the period ended March 31, 2016 was $149,088 or $1.49 earnings per share compared to a net loss of $6,674 or $0.07 loss per share during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  







	Year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014




	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred operating expenses of $840,981 compared to $921,682 during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Overall, our sales were slightly lower in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 which led to lower operating costs; however, our operating expense as a percentage of revenues were 95% in fiscal 2015 compared to 97.2% in fiscal 2014 which shows that we utilized some efficiency in our operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015.  





	We recorded a net loss of $145,249 or $1.45 loss per share during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $239,217 or $2.39 loss per share during the year ended December 31, 2014.


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources









	Three months ended March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015







	As at March 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $21,776 and total assets of $321,564 compared to cash of $9,090 and total assets of $198,941 at December 31, 2015.  Overall, our cash increased due to more cash flow generated from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and our total assets increased due to an increase in accounts receivable of $110,596 due in part to higher sales revenue and a longer lead time in the collection of outstanding accounts receivable.





	We had total liabilities of $144,778 at March 31, 2016 compared to $136,699 at December 31, 2015.   The increase in total liabilities was primarily due to an increase in our bank overdraft of $9,149.







	Year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014







	As at December 31, 2015, we had cash of $9,090 and total assets of $198,941 compared to cash of $31,151 and total assets of $453,713 at December 31, 2014.  The decrease in cash was due to the fact that we spent more available cash to pay down our outstanding accounts payable.  The decrease in total assets was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $137,489 as we had lower sales in fiscal 2015 and had better collection rates during fiscal 2015.  Furthermore, we had a decrease of $71,944 in intangible assets for a patient and customer list which became fully amortized in fiscal 2015.  





	We had total liabilities of $136,699 at December 31, 2015 compared to $130,196 at December 31, 2014.  The increase in liabilities was due to the use of a bank overdraft of $36,159 in fiscal 2015 which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $26,734.

	Cash flow from Operating Activities




	 




	Three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015







	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we received cash of $28,081 from operating activities compared to $22,010 during the three months ended March 31, 2015.  The increase in the cash received from operating activities as based on the fact that we had increased our operating efficiency which allowed us to show a higher gross profit resulting in more net cash from operating activities during the period.







	Year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014







	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received cash of $38,073 from operating activities compared to use of $122,214 of cash for operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.  In fiscal 2014, we had higher operating costs which resulted in a greater use of cash as well as higher accounts receivable from uncollected sales which were subsequently collected in fiscal 2015.  


	 




	Cashflow from Investing Activities




	 




	Three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015







	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we did not have any investing activities compared to the use of $600 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 for purchase of property and equipment.







	Year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014







	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we used $6,064 of cash for investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment compared to the use of $12,077 during the year ended December 31, 2014 which included $2,077 for the purchase of property and equipment and $10,000 for the purchase of the customer list.   


	 




	Cashflow from Financing Activities




	 




	Three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015

	Critical Accounting Policies







	Our financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP).  The accounting policies of an entity are the specific accounting principles and the methods of applying those principles are judged by the management of the entity to be the most appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly financial position, cash flows, and results of operations in accordance with US GAAP and that, accordingly, have been adopted for preparing our consolidated financial statements.  







	Going Concern







	Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that we will continue to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business.   During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $145,249 and had a working capital deficit of $46,801.  The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability to raise capital through debt or equity financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from our business.  These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  







	Use of Estimates and Assumptions




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We are required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.




	Revenue Recognition




	Our revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC Topic 605,

	Revenue Recognition.

	We recognize revenue when the service has been provided, the products have been shipped and billed to our customers, insurance companies, and government agencies, and no other significant obligations exist, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Our billings are subject to insurance company and government regulatory agency adjustments. We revise the amount of revenue recognized when the insurance company and government regulatory adjustments are known to us.  The adjustments to the amounts we can bill are changed approximately every five years when the government asks companies to submit a new bid. There is approximately a one year delay between when we are notified of any price changes until the time the new amounts come into effect.







	Accounts Receivable







	Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount that we expect to collect. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Past due balances over 90 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Based on managements assessment, we provide for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.





	We report patient accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments. Patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from Medicare, other third-party payers and patients. Our process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections and trends in reimbursement. 






	Page 16 of 25












	Inventory







	We purchase inventory from third party vendors, which consists of wheelchairs and scooters. Inventory, when carried if at all, represents finished goods, which is stated at lower of cost or market. We periodically review the value of items held in inventory and provides for write-downs or write-offs based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold.  We generally purchases product when it has a firm sales or service order.







	Earnings (Loss) Per Share







	Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net income (loss) by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period. Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or common stock equivalent. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic income (loss) per share due to no dilutive items having been issued by us.







	Recent Accounting Pronouncements







	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09)

	, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which it will adopt the standard beginning January 1, 2017.





	In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.

	The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period.


	 


	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,

	Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.

	ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU 2015-02 is effective for periods beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


	 


	In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,

	Business Combinations (Topic 805).  


	Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same periods financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.

	ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.






	Page 17 of 25










	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

	. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

	Leases (Topic 842)

	. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,

	Leases (FAS 13)

	. ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.





	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE








	Related Party Transactions







	As of December 31, 2014, the Company was owed $25,797, net of an allowance of $135,973, from Ms. Rico. These advances are unsecured and carry no interest or repayment terms.  At September 30, 2015, the balance owed to the Company from its Ms. Rico was $100,046. At September 30, 2015, the Companys board of directors approved such amount outstanding as a distribution to stockholder in compensation for services provided by the Ms. Rico.  In addition, during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company advanced the Ms. Rico an additional $15,980. At December 31, 2015, the Companys board of directors approved $15,980 as a distribution to stockholder in compensation for services provided by the Ms. Rico.





	Other than the foregoing, none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially more than 5% of the Companys outstanding shares of its common stock, nor any associate or affiliate of such persons or companies, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past fiscal year, or in any proposed transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company.





	With regard to any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions in the following manner:


	 


	·


	Disclosing such transactions in reports where required;


	·


	Disclosing in any and all filings with the SEC, where required;


	·


	Obtaining disinterested directors consent; and


	·


	Obtaining shareholder consent where required.







	Director Independence







	For purposes of determining director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCBB on which shares of the Companys Common Stock are quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of Independent Director means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.


	 


	According to the NASDAQ definition, we have no independent directors.

	MARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS



	 




	Common Stock







	Our common stock was approved for quotation on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol YNXG. Trading in stocks quoted on these markets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with a company's operations or business prospects. As of the date of this current report, there was no bid history for our common stock, because the common stock has never been traded. We cannot assure you that there will be a market for our common stock in the future. There are no shares of common stock or other securities of our company that are being, or have been publicly proposed to be, publicly offered by our company, the offering of which could have a material effect on the market price of common stock or other securities of our company.





	As of the date of this Report, there were 5 holders of record of our common stock.







	Dividends







	No cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.







	Re-Purchase of Equity Securities

	ITEM 12.




	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS






	Section 78.138 of the NRS provides that a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the directors or officers acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law.





	Section 78.7502 of NRS permits a company to indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful.





	Section 78.751 of NRS permits a Nevada company to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred by them in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the company. Section 78.751 of NRS further permits the company to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise.





	Section 78.752 of NRS provides that a Nevada company may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the company has the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses.





	Our Articles of Incorporation provide that no director or officer of our company will be personally liable to our company or any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer (i) for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or (ii) the unlawful payment of dividends. In addition, our bylaws permit for the indemnification and insurance provisions in Chapter 78 of the NRS.





	Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.





	At the present time, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, officer, employee or other agent of ours in which indemnification would be required or permitted. We are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding, which may result in a claim for such indemnification.





	Further, in the normal course of business, we may have in our contracts indemnification clauses, written as either mutual where each party will indemnify, defend, and hold each other harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties; or single where we have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses etc.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT 


	REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 




	 




	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of




	Proto Script Pharmaceuticals Corp.




	 




	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Proto Script Pharmaceuticals Corp.




	(the "Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statement of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.




	 




	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their consolidated operations, changes in stockholders equity and their consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidate financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	PROTO-SCRIPT PHARMACEUTICALS, CORP.






	Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements




	For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and




	for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited)










	NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS



	_____________________________________________________________________________________________





	Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the state of California on June 27, 2001 and currently operates as PSP Homecare (dba). The Company has contracts with Medicare, Medi-Cal, IEHP and various other state and governmental insurance providers. These contracts provide the Company the right to sell and repair durable medical equipment (DME). The Company bills the insurance providers for payment. The Companys primary business is to repair power wheelchairs and scooters which are classified as DME products and reimbursable by healthcare insurance providers.





	The Companys health care insurance contracts allow it the ability to service patients nationally. The Company is seeking to expand its market through additional contracts and open several repair facilities throughout the continental United States. Currently the Company has repair facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, Rancho-Cucamonga, and Anaheim, California.






	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	_____________________________________________________________________________________________





	The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The accounting policies of an entity are the specific accounting principles and the methods of applying those principles that are judged by the management of the entity to be the most appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly financial position, cash flows, and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and that, accordingly, have been adopted for preparing the consolidated financial statements.





	The accounting policies adopted by an entity can affect significantly the presentation of its financial position, cash flows, and results of operations. Accordingly, the usefulness of financial statements for purposes of making economic decisions about the entity depends significantly upon the user's understanding of the accounting policies followed by the entity.






	Basis of Accounting






	The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company elected a December 31, year-end.






	Principles of Consolidation






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp., a Nevada Corporation.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.






	Going Concern






	The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations since 2013 and has stockholders equity has decreased from $323,517 at December 31, 2014 to $62,242 at December 31, 2015.  In all likelihood the Company will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with expansion of its business development efforts along with ever-increasing overhead expenses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.





	Management seeks to raise capital through the sale of equity securities, offering of debt instruments, and borrowings from financial institutions or other resources. There is no certainty that management will be successful in these efforts.






	Interim Financial Statements






	The interim financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Companys financial position, the results of its operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying interim financial statements do not include all the disclosures normally presented in annual financial statements.






	7

















	Cash






	For purposes of the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 and 2014.






	Use of Estimates






	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.





	Significant estimates made in connection with the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the estimation of fair values in connection with the analysis of intangible assets for impairment and estimated useful lives for intangible assets and property and equipment.






	Concentration of Risk






	The Company maintains various bank accounts at financial institutions located in California and Nevada. Accounts at each bank are temporarily insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. As of March 31, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company had no uninsured cash balances. The Company experienced no losses from such accounts and management believes it places its cash on deposit with financial institutions that are financially stable.






	Accounts Receivable






	Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Past due balances over 90 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Based on managements assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Bad debt expense (loss recovery) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $51,990 and $0, respectively and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $0 (unaudited), respectively.






	Collectability






	The Company is governed by Medicare standards and therefore agrees to accept the Medicare-approved amounts as the total payment for the service or item. The Company also agrees to bill Medicare and other or suppliers directly on behalf of the patient.





	We report patient accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments. Patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from Medicare, other third-party payers and patients. Our process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections and trends in reimbursement. 






	Revenue Recognition



	The Companys revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC Topic 605,

	Revenue Recognition.

	The Company recognizes revenue when it provided the services, shipped the products and billed its customers, insurance companies, and government agencies, and no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. The Companys billings are subject to insurance company and government regulatory agency adjustments. The Company revises the amount of revenue recognized when the insurance company and government regulatory adjustments are known to the Company. The adjustments to the amounts the Company can bill are changed approximately every five years when the government asks companies to submit a new bid. There is approximately one year between the time the Company is notified of any price changes until the time the new amounts come into effect.

	Inventory






	The Company purchases inventory from third party vendors, which consists of wheelchairs and scooters. Inventory, when carried if at all, represents finished goods, which is stated at lower of cost or market. The Company periodically reviews the value of items held in inventory and provides for write-downs or write-offs based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company generally purchases product when it has a firm sales or service order.  At March 31, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no inventory on hand.






	Long-Lived Assets






	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then assets are written down first, followed by other long-lived assets of the operation to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. As March 31, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairment losses recognized for long-lived assets






	Property and Equipment






	Property and equipment are stated at cost and consists of a delivery vehicle, furniture and equipment. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over 60 months, the estimated useful life.





	Property and equipment consists of:

	Intangible assets






	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an asset's useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset's useful life or carrying value involves significant judgment.





	During 2012, the Company purchased a competitor patient list for $230,000. The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of $35,000 and an installment purchase obligation of $195,000. At December 31, 2013, the installment purchase obligation was paid in full. The Company amortizes the patient list over its estimated useful life of 36 months.





	During 2014, the Company purchased a competitor customer list for $10,000. Purchase price consisted of a cash payment of $10,000. The Company amortizes the customer list over its estimated useful life of 12 months.

	Income Taxes






	The Company elected S corporation treatment for income tax purposes as provided for under §1362 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. An S corporation is generally not subject to federal income tax. During March 2015 the Company elected to terminate its S corporation status.





	Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards available. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the period for its deferred tax assets and liabilities.





	Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.





	No provision was made for Federal income tax nor minimum state franchise tax.






	Earnings (Loss) per Share






	Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income (loss) by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period. Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or common stock equivalent. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic income (loss) per share due to no dilutive items having been issued by the Company.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09)

	, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which it will adopt the standard beginning January 1, 2017.





	In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.

	The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period.

	In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,

	Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.

	ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU 2015-02 is effective for periods beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


	 


	In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,

	Business Combinations (Topic 805).  


	Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same periods financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.

	ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

	. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

	Leases (Topic 842)

	. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,

	Leases (FAS 13)

	. ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.





	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.

	YANEX GROUP, INC.



	Notes to the Pro-Forma Consolidated Financial Statements


	(unaudited)









	1.




	Basis of Presentation






	On June 29, 2016, Yanex Group, Inc. (Yanex or the Company) entered into a share exchange agreement with Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp. (PSPC), a private corporation formed under the laws of the State of California on June 27, 2001 and currently operating as PSP Homecare.  Under the terms of the agreement, Yanex acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of PSPC in exchange for 30,000,000 restricted common shares of the Company.  As a result of the transaction, the Company has 33,048,000 issued and outstanding common shares, of which the shareholders of PSPC holds 30,000,000 common shares or 90.8% of the issued and common shares of the Company, resulting in a reverse merger whereby PSPC is considered the accounting acquirer.  





	These unaudited pro forma financial statements (pro forma financial statements) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP) and are expressed in US dollars.  These pro forma financial statements do not contain all of the information required for annual financial statements. Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual and interim financial statements of Yanex.





	These pro forma financial statements have been compiled from and include:





	(a) an unaudited pro forma balance sheet combining the unaudited interim balance sheet of Yanex as of November 30, 2015 and the audited balance sheet of PSPC as of December 31, 2015, which represents the most financial information available for either company at the fiscal year-end date and giving effect to the transaction as if there has been no material modifications in either companys financial position;





	(b) an unaudited pro forma statement of operations combining the unaudited interim statement of operations of Yanex for the three month period ended February 29, 2016 and PSPC for the three month period ended March 31, 2016; and





	(c) an unaudited pro forma statement of operations combining the unaudited interim statement of operations of Yanex for the twelve month period ended November 30, 2015 and PSPC for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015.





	The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been compiled using the significant accounting policies as set out in the audited financial statements of Yanex for the year ended May 31, 2015. Based on the review of the accounting policies of Yanex and PSPC, there are no material accounting differences between the accounting policies of the companies. The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto of Yanex.





	It is managements opinion that these pro forma financial statements include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation, in all material respects, of the proposed transaction described above in accordance with US GAAP applied on a basis consistent with Yanexs accounting policies. No adjustments have been made to reflect potential cost savings that may occur subsequent to completion of the transaction. The pro forma statement of operations does not reflect non-recurring charges or credits directly attributable to the transaction, of which none are currently anticipated.





	The unaudited pro forma financial statements are not intended to reflect the results of operations or the financial position of Yanex which would have actually resulted had the proposed transaction been effected on the dates indicated. Further, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be obtained in the future. The pro forma adjustments and allocations of the purchase price for PSPC are based in part on provisional estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any final adjustments may change the allocation of purchase price which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements.

	Share Exchange Agreement between Yanex and PSPC






	On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with PSPC for all of the issued and outstanding common shares of PSPC.  





	Pursuant to the agreement, Yanex acquired all of the outstanding common shares of in exchange for 30,000,000 common shares of the Company.  The shareholders of PSPC will control approximately 90.8% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Yanex, resulting in a change in control.  The transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization transaction, given the fact that the Company held no net monetary assets at the date of the merger transaction.  As PSPC is deemed to be the purchaser for accounting purposes under recapitalization accounting, these pro forma financial statements are presented as a continuation of PSPC.  The equity of PSPC is presented as the equity of the combined company and the capital stock account of PSPC is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding and issued common stock of the legal acquirer (Yanex) after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the share exchange agreement.  






	3.




	Pro Forma Assumptions and Adjustments






	The unaudited pro-forma consolidated financial statements incorporate the following pro forma assumptions and adjustments:





	(a) For purposes of these pro-forma consolidated financial statements, it is assumed that all shareholders of PSPC exchanged their common shares for 30,000,000 common shares of Yanex, at a rate of 30 common shares of Yanex per common share of PSPC.





	(b) The cash assets and liabilities of Yanex are not to be assumed by PSPC.

	Overview







	We were founded in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010, as an early stage company operating within the concept architectural, interior design project and related areas in Germany initially. Our plan was to operate in various architectural fields and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas. Also, we intended to work with interior design view, visualization and renderings. After attempting to implement our business plan, we have determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to seek out and identify potential acquisition partners, joint ventures or other strategic alliances.





	Accordingly, on June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange) with Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp., a California corporation (PSPC), whereby the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PSPC, in exchange for Thirty Million (30,000,000) restricted shares of the Companys common stock. Accordingly, PSPC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the business direction of the Company has shifted to the business of PSPC.





	We are a development stage company. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our common stock trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol YNXG.


	 


	We do not have any subsidiaries. Our principal office is located at 9830 6th Street, Suite 103, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730. Our telephone number is (855) 476-7679. Our fiscal year end is May 31.


	 


	We have incurred losses since our inception. We rely upon the sale of our securities to fund our operations. We have not generated any revenues from November 18, 2010 (date of inception) to May 31, 2016.





	We are not involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings.








	Who We Are:






	The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on June 27, 2001 under the name of Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp.





	The Companys primary source of revenue comes from the repair and rental of power wheelchairs and scooters. The Company deals with federal, state and private insurance providers such as Medicare, Medi-Cal, Nevada Care and Blue Cross among several others. PSPC has very limited dealings with non-insured cash patients. We have tangible assets comprised of company delivery vehicles, loaner wheelchairs, office equipment and furniture. Inventory is purchased on an as needed basis, typically when patients/customers are approved for coverage by their insurance provider. Intangible assets comprise of its current patient list and working relationships with the various insurance providers who refer their clients to us for their repair and rental needs.

	Competitive Advantages






	We qualify as a small supplier as defined by the Medicare competitive bidding program which we feel increases our changes of being awarded winning bids in the upcoming recompete rounds. Regulations stipulate that if 30% of winning companies do not fall under the small supplier category then more small suppliers must be added in essence making our changes one in three or better. We are able to meet our service standards by buying product only on an as needed basis. This prevents the Company from having to output cash before a purchase order is made.





	All patients are pre-qualified before products are ordered and as such there is a low risk of non-payment. When the insurance provider refuses payment it is typically due to an error on the part of the staff in entering and/or submitting the claim. Upon re-entry the claim is typically successful.





	Although we do a majority of our purchases from three different suppliers due to better-negotiated prices, we are able to buy the parts and products needed from various local and out of state suppliers.






	Repair Sales Cycle






	Our typical repair cycle is as follows:





	1.


	Patient lead


	a.


	New patient referral is sent to PSPC


	b.


	Current patient is called


	c.


	Current patient calls in


	d.


	New patient is obtained





	2.


	Patient information is gathered and insurance coverage eligibility is verified





	3.


	Upon verification a repair technician calls the patient for a preliminary telephone diagnosis





	4.


	Based on the repairs the technician believes is needed, a second eligibility check is done to confirm the patient qualifies for those specific repairs





	5.


	The office manager confirms a date and time range with the patient for the technician to pick up the equipment





	6.


	Routing information is passed on to the repair technician





	7.


	Repair technician sanitizes and loads a loaner wheelchair based on the patients specific needs and criteria





	8.


	Repair technician drops off the loaner chair, picks up the patients equipment and fills out the necessary paperwork





	9.


	The equipment is brought to the warehouse for a thorough diagnosis and forwarded to the office manager





	a.


	If is typical upon full diagnostic testing the technician finds other parts in need of replacement or repair





	10.


	Eligibility is ran for a third and final time to confirm insurance coverage including any new parts that may be needed





	11.


	The patient is contacted by the office manager to confirm the repairs that will be done and timeframe for expected delivery





	12.


	Upon complete repair of the equipment:





	a.


	Head technician does a final inspection on the equipment





	b.


	The paperwork is forwarded to the office manager to setup a date and time frame for equipment drop off





	13.


	Paperwork is forwarded to the billing department for processing





	14.


	The patients equipment is sanitized and prepared for delivery





	15.


	The equipment is delivered to the patient, the loaner is picked up and paperwork is filled by the patient






	4










	16.


	The loaner equipment is returned to the warehouse, sanitized and stored






	Operating Systems and Controls






	The Company currently uses a combination of software for the daily business operations. The main billing and patient information software is being phased out and being be replaced by a more current software. We expect the new software to help reduce paper, redundancies, man-hours, mistakes and the potential loss of data while increasing the security of patients information. Our billing process will also be more efficient as secondary payers will be processed automatically and triggered at the earliest possible moment.






	Growth Strategy






	The dollar amount and frequency companies are allowed to bill patients and their insurance providers is set by Medicare and therefore our competitors in the same product categories must charge the same price. Margins can be increased by processing more patients and decreasing costs. PSPC has the ability to process more patients without increase overhead and labor cost. Additionally, the Company intends to advertise its billing services to other medical companies around the country. Companies in the durable medical equipment industry use standard Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) in order to submit their invoices electronically to the insurance providers. Other companies can benefit from not needing in-house billing by hiring PSPC to process their payments for a rate of 3-5% of the revenue.






	Competitive Bidding Area (CBA)






	Since the Company does not currently hold a winning bid for one of the competitive bidding (as further explained below) areas (CBAs) it has the potential to significantly increase revenues by doing so. PSPC will also benefit from lower cost of goods because of the expected increase in volume. There are several criteria used to determine a companys qualification and more than one company can awarded an area and product. We plan to aggressively target products, such as catheters, that dont fall under CBA in the areas currently serviced of Southern California and Las Vegas.






	Current Working Relationships






	We employ several strategies to increase its revenue. One approach is to increase the referrals from the insurance providers by building relationships based on positive patient feedback. Insurance providers will refer a maximum of patients at any given time equivalent to the number of loaner equipment in stock. For example, by us having 120 loaner power wheelchairs in stock each provider will refer up to 120 patients at a given time.






	Current Patient Database






	A patient qualifies for repairs on their power wheelchair or scooter every six months to one year depending on the part that is in need of repair or replacing and a brand new power wheelchair every five years. The patient database is constantly being contacted to arrange for repair upon a prior successful eligibility check.






	Intellectual Property






	We have no patents or trademarks or applications pending.






	Government Regulations






	Numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations, including the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology For Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively HIPAA), govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and disclosure of patients individually-identifiable health information. As part of our provision of, and billing for, health care equipment and services, we are required to collect and maintain such protected patient-identifiable health information. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action, state legislative actions or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health care related data and communicate with payers. Moreover, the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. While we believe we comply in all material respects with HIPAA, and comparable state privacy and security requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of these regulations. Sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties. A violation could subject us to penalties, fines or possible exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.






	5










	The federal government has made a policy decision to significantly increase the financial resources allocated to enforcing the health care fraud and abuse laws. Private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny of health care claims in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices in the health care area.






	Medicare and Medicaid






	As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, Congress enacted the Medicare program, which provides for hospital, physician and other statutorily defined health benefits for qualified individuals, including persons 65 and older and the disabled. The Medicaid program, also established by Congress in 1965, is a joint federal and state program that provides certain statutorily-defined health benefits to financially needy individuals who are blind, disabled, aged or members of families with dependent children.





	Under existing Medicare laws and regulations, the sale and rental of our products is generally reimbursed by the Medicare program according to prescribed fee schedule amounts calculated using statutorily-prescribed formulas. Significant legislation affecting home medical equipment (HME) reimbursement has been signed into law, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA), the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), the Medicare, Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and changes to these programs and acts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.






	Competitive Bidding Area (CBA)






	The Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services.





	Under the program, a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted. Suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products. Not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding. Bids are submitted electronically through a web-based application process and required documents are mailed. Bids are evaluated based on the suppliers eligibility, its financial stability and the bid price. Contracts are awarded to the Medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards. Contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount. The amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item.





	The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is required by law to recompete contracts under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program at least once every three years. The Round 2 and national mail-order program contract periods expire on June 30, 2016. The federal government awards contracts to companies in the durable medical equipment (DME) industry upon a successful bid to service the specific areas and products. Winners of bid reserve the right service the competitive bidding areas (CBAs) for a period of two years. After the two year period the contract holders lose their rights and the CBA all interested DME companies as requested to submit a bid.





	PSPC does not currently hold a winning bid and has submitted a bid for Round 2 Recompete.






	The Anti-Kickback Statute






	Due to high fraud in the industry, companies such as ours that operate within the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to strict fraud and abuse laws often referred to as the Anti-Kickback statute. At the federal level, the Anti-Kickback statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing any remuneration, including a bribe, kickback or rebate, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referral of patients, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs. Federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government, including Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Violations of the Anti-Kickback statute may result in civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to $25,000 per violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs.

	CHAP Accreditation






	We are voluntarily part of the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) which is an industry recognized accreditation meeting high standards covering compliance requirements as prescribed by state and federal bodies. Payers and patients appreciated CHAP as a non-biased third-party approval of the company in the industry. CHAP also keeps the Company up-to-date with regulatory changes and provides ongoing education to staff to familiarize themselves on how to stay in compliance.






	Competition






	We operated in a highly competitive industry with few national competitors and several local, small and medium sized businesses. Our biggest competitor is Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. which has local national offices. Local competitors include Lincoln Medical and Westview Medical. Management believes that the number of competitors will decrease over the long run because of decreasing profit margins due to the competitive bidding programs implemented by the government. The nature of the competitive bidding encourages lower prices therefore forcing some companies out of businesses.






	Employees






	As of January 1, 2016, we have 13 full time employees. Our employees are not currently represented by a labor union of labor organization. These employees are spread out into various departments, including management, billing, sales and repair. The billing, sales and management are headquartered out of Rancho Cucamonga, CA, while Anaheim, CA serves as repair facilities with limited staff.





	The Las Vegas office is the headquarters for Nevada as well as it serves as a repair facility. Anaheim and Las Vegas each have outside sales staff. All locations are required to be staffed for a minimum number of hours a week as required by state laws.








	The sales department includes outside and inside sales people. Outside sales people host fall prevention seminars in order to generate leads. The seminars are held at care facilities and during the presentation the repair technician provides equipment cleaning and onsite repair at no cost.






	Subsidiaries



	 


	As of August 17, 2016 we do not have any subsidiaries.


	 



	Research and Development Expenditures



	 


	We have not spent any amounts on research and development activities since our inception. Our planned expenditures for our operation and exploration programs are summarized under the section of this Annual Report entitled Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


	 



	Government Regulations






	We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our industry in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.






	US Regulations






	Our operations are or will be subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.

	Market Information



	 


	There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol YNXG.OB. Our common stock became eligible for trading on November 25, 2011. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a companys operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock.


	 


	OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.


	 


	The following table shows the high and low closing prices of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board. The following quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions:

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM







	To the Board of Directors of Yanex Group, Inc.







	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Yanex Group, Inc. as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. Yanex Group, Inc. management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.







	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.







	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yanex Group, Inc. as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.






	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	1. Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business






	Yanex Group, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010. The Company business is to provide services in concept architecture, interior design projects and related services in Germany, and eventually expand into Europe and other countries. The Company is a start-up company.





	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of May 31, 2016, the Company has not recognized any revenue and has an accumulated deficit of $186,361. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Companys future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	2. Significant Accounting Policies






	(a)


	Basis of Presentation





	The financial statements present the balance sheets, statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.





	(b)


	Use of Estimates





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported accounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.





	(c)


	Cash and cash equivalents





	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.





	(d)


	Financial Instruments





	Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

	(continued)





	(d)


	Financial Instruments (continued)






	Level 1






	Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

	Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.






	Level 3






	Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.





	The Companys financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts due from related parties, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 820 and 825, the fair value of our cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.





	(e)


	Income Taxes





	The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.





	(f)


	Comprehensive Loss





	ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As of May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, the Company has no items that represent comprehensive income or loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.





	(g)


	Loss per Share





	The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of May 31, 2016, the Company did not have any potentially dilutive shares.

	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2016 (the Evaluation Date). Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the Evaluation Date, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures.






	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and our receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and Management has concluded that the Companys internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective as of May 31, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.





	The material weakness relates to the lack of segregation of duties in our financial reporting process and we utilize outside third party consultants. We do not have a separately designated audit committee. This weakness is due to our lack of excess working capital to hire additional staff. To remedy this material weakness, we intend to engage an internal accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow.





	KLJ & Associates, LLP, our registered independent public accounting firm, was not required to and has not issued a report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016.






	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.








	12

















	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls






	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management or board override of the control.





	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.


	 





	Changes in Internal Control and Financial Reporting






	During the quarter ended May 31, 2016 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	None of our directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons has been involved in any of the following events during the past five years:

	being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.






	14

















	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance Reporting






	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires a companys directors and officers, and persons who own more than ten-percent (10%) of the companys common stock, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission reports of ownership on Form 3 and reports of change in ownership on Forms 4 and 5. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders are also required to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us and on written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all Section 16(a) reports applicable to our officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders with respect to the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 were filed.






	Code of Ethics



	 


	We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions because we have not yet finalized the content of such a code. Companies whose equity securities are listed for trading on the OTC Markets are not currently required to implement a code of ethics.


	 



	Director Nominees






	As of May 31, 2016 there have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.






	Audit Committee



	 


	The functions of the Audit Committee are currently carried out by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not presently need an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors carrying out the duties of the Audit Committee. Our Board of Directors has determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as one of our directors and to be a member of the Audit Committee or otherwise perform Audit Committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert on the Audit Committee.

	Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans






	There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits to our directors or executive officers. We have no material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.






	Compensation Committee






	We currently do not have a compensation committee of the Board of Directors or a committee performing a similar function. It is the view of the Board that it is appropriate for us not to have such a committee because of our size and because the Board as a whole determines executive compensation. Each of our directors is also is a senior officer of the company.






	Compensation Committee Report






	Our Board of Directors as a whole has revised and discussed the compensation discussion and analysis disclosed in this Form 10-K and based on this review and discussion, has determined that the disclosure be included in this annual report.






	Compensation of Directors



	 


	We do not pay our directors any fees for attendance at Board meetings or similar remuneration or reimburse them for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with our business.








	Change of Control






	As of May 31, 2016 we had no pension plans or compensatory plans or other arrangements which provide compensation in the event of a termination of employment or a change in our control.

	Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence







	Director Independence



	 


	The OTC Bulletin Board on which our common shares are listed on does not have any director independence requirements. We also do not have a definition of independence as our directors also hold positions executive officer positions with us. Once we engage further directors and officers, we plan to develop a definition of independence and scrutinize our Board of Directors with regards to this definition.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and best-effort basis: no 
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. 
The offering price per share is $0.05. The following table sets forth the 
uses of proceeds assuming the sale of one-third, two-third and 100%, 
respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. The offering 
scenarios presented are for illustrative purposes only, the actual amount of 
proceeds, if any, may differ. There is no assurance that we will raise the 
full $75,000 as anticipated.

Other Expenses            $  500            $  4,000    $  5,000 
 
The above figures represent only estimated costs. All proceeds will be 
deposited into our corporate bank account.  If necessary, Alexander Yanov, 
our sole officer and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds 
to complete the registration process but we will require a minimum funding 
of approximately $25,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a minimum 
period of one year. No proceeds from this offering will be used to repay Mr.
Yanov for any funds advanced for the purpose of completing the registration
process.


Winning customers will be critical to our ability to grow our business. We are 
a new and un-established company, have a weak competitive position in the 
industry and have not yet earned any revenues.  We have an operational loss 
of $4,509 from November 18, 2010 (date of inception) to May 31, 2011. We 
need capital to carry out our current business plan.  We also anticipate 
that we will require additional financing in order to execute our business 
plan.  We may not have sufficient financing to sustain our current 
operations.  Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater 
financial and technical resources than those available to us.  It is 
uncertain whether services offered by Yanex Group, Inc. will achieve and 
sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. 

The market competition of Baden-Wurttemberg federal state can be evaluated 
as a high. There are several large well-established international 
architectural companies which provide similar service for large scale 
projects. That is why we plan to concentrate in small and middle-scale 
sized projects. Our competitors include all architectural and interior 
design companies offering service in both commercial and residential 
design throughout Germany/Europe. In order to be more or less successful 
in the existing stiff condition we will provide a new vision of modern 
single family houses which are characterized by using brand-new materials, 
environment friendly technologies and out of the ordinary appearance. Also 
we plan to create some typed projects  with standard type of plan layouts 
and number of spaces and  which can be constructed in different areas with 
different surroundings and which can cost much less. Finally we will make 
competitive price for our work in order to get more clients.


Company Description
Yanex Group, Inc was founded in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010. We 
just recently started our operations. We plan to work in the field of concept 
architectural, interior design projects and related areas in Germany 
initially and further spread the business in Europe and other countries.


  We 
are a development stage company. We are a company without revenues and have 
limited operations; we have minimal assets and have incurred losses since 
inception. Our financial statements for the period from November 18, 2010 
(date of inception) to May 31, 2011, report no revenues and a net loss of 
$4,509. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit 
opinion for Yanex Group, Inc. which includes a statement expressing 
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, 
the only operations we have engaged in are the development of a business plan 
and the execution of Professional Service Agreement with Ebby Kuriakose 
Moolayil. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our 
business operations. Being a development stage company, we have very limited 
operating history.  

Our principal office is located at Filderbahnplatz, 33-1404, Stuttgart, 
Germany 70567. Our telephone number is 011-49-176-39059436.
