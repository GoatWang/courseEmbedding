Vision & Values
Our Mission
CTI BioPharma is a biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to acquire, develop and bring to market less toxic, more effective therapies to treat and cure cancer. Our therapeutic focus is on novel targeted therapies covering a spectrum of blood-related cancers. We see patients as people, looking at potential therapies from the patient’s perspective to address both the clinical need and the impact treatment can have on a patient’s life. We prioritize the patient experience and are committed to developing therapeutic options for people living with cancer who want a chance at a longer and better quality of life.
Our Vision
To be the recognized leader in translating scientific discoveries into innovative therapies to cure patients with blood-related cancers.
Our Values
Our priority and sense of purpose is —the PATIENT. Our patient focus shapes our culture, organization and values.
Company success is dependent on our EMPLOYEES’ creativity and dedication. Without their talent, commitment and focus, we would not reach the ambitious goals we set for ourselves.
Our employees are dedicated to TEAMWORK. We have a true sense of ownership for our work and how it is tied directly to products that may significantly improve the outcome of patients’ lives.
We feel a responsibility to give back to our COMMUNITY. We contribute to numerous local organizations and support employee initiatives beyond the workplace.
The “patient first” focus gives us a greater understanding of our market—it is the key to serving our customers well and building SHAREHOLDER value.

Why CTI BioPharma Corp. Stock Popped Today
The blood-cancer-focused biotech isn't out of the woods yet, but it looks like it will finally be allowed to continue an important clinical trial.

What happened
Shares of CTI BioPharma Corp. (NASDAQ:CTIC) had notched a 20.4% gain as of 11:27 a.m. EST today. It appears the blood-cancer-focused biotech will finally be allowed to continue a pivotal trial with pacritinib.

CTIC data by YCharts.
So what
CTI BioPharma stock suffered a severe market beatdown last February when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) slapped a partial hold on clinical studies with pacritinib. Under the hold, investigators were barred from starting treatment with the experimental myelofibrosis drug, and the development of one of the company's most important assets stalled.
The company has one commercial-stage product in the European Union (EU), but Pixuvri for treatment of extremely difficult-to-treat patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma hasn't earned an FDA approval. In the first nine months of 2016, CTI BioPharma recorded just $3.26 million in product sales, which is hardly enough to cover its extensive research and development outlays.





Now what
Adding a second product to its commercial lineup, hopefully pacritinib for treatment of myelofibrosis, is vital to achieving sustainable, positive cash flows. From the beginning of 2016 through the end of September that year, CTI recorded a $46.4 million loss despite receiving $48.3 million from pacritinib development partner Baxalta, which is now a part of Shire (NASDAQ:SHPG).
The company finished September with just $61.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, which suggests another value-diluting share offering will be necessary in the near future just to keep operations humming along. The company's market capitalization sank from around $350 million ahead of the hold to around $135 million at recent prices. That seems awfully cheap for a company with one commercial-stage drug, albeit in the EU only, plus pacritinib, which is ready to begin a pivotal study and has a chance of receiving an expedited review if its application is accepted by the FDA.
Any more hold-worthy side effects associated with pacritinib would be disastrous, but this tiny biotech is worth keeping an eye on this year. Successful results from the greenlighted pivotal trial could make today's gains seem trivial in comparison.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain, in addition to historical information, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, terms such as "anticipates," "believes," "continue," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "potential," "predicts," "should," or "will" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terms are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements include statements concerning sufficiency of cash resources and other projections, product manufacturing and sales, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, financings and additional losses. These statements are based on assumptions about many important factors and information currently available to us to the extent that we have thus far had an opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate such information in light of all surrounding facts, circumstances, recommendations and analyses. Additionally, these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, or the 2016 Form 10-K, particularly in "Factors Affecting Our Business, Financial Condition, Operating Results and Prospects," that could cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ significantly from those projected. Although we believe that expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We will not update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or changes in our expectations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  OVERVIEW  We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies covering a spectrum of blood-related cancers that offer a unique benefit to patients and health care providers. Our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize, either alone or with partners. We are currently concentrating our efforts on treatments that target blood-related cancers where there is an unmet medical need. In particular, we are primarily focused on evaluating pacritinib for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis and the further development of PIXUVRI worldwide, for which our partner, Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, or collectively Servier, has commercialization rights outside the United States, or the U.S.  PIXUVRI  PIXUVRI is a novel aza-anthracenedione with unique structural and physiochemical properties. In May 2012, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union, or the E.U., for PIXUVRI as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. PIXUVRI is the first approved treatment in the E.U. for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL who have failed two or three prior lines of therapy. As a part of the conditional marketing authorization, we are required to conduct a post-authorization trial, which we refer to as PIX306, comparing PIXUVRI and rituximab with gemcitabine and rituximab in the setting of aggressive B-cell NHL. Although we do not have and are not currently pursuing regulatory approval of PIXUVRI in the U.S., we may reevaluate a possible submission strategy in the U.S. based on the data generated from the PIX306 study. Pursuant to our conditional marketing authorization in the E.U., and an extension granted in September 2016, we are required to submit the requisite clinical study report for PIX306 by December 2018.  In April 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Restated Agreement, with Servier. Under the Restated Agreement, Servier will have rights to PIXUVRI in all markets except in the U.S. where we will retain the commercialization rights. Previously Servier had rights to commercialize the drug globally except in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., and the U.S. Servier will pay us ?12.0 million and is obligated to purchase a certain amount of PIXUVRI drug product for an additional ?0.9 million within 30 days of the Restated Agreement. We are eligible to receive up to ?76.0 million in additional sales and regulatory milestone payments as well as royalties on net product sales.  For additional information on our collaboration with Servier, please see the discussion in Part I, Item 2, "License Agreements and Milestone Activities - Servier."  Pacritinib  Our lead development candidate, pacritinib, is an investigational oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, FLT3, IRAK1 and CSF1R. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, due to its inhibition of c-fms, IRAK1, JAK2 and FLT3. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens.  Pacritinib was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, known as the PERSIST program, for patients with myelofibrosis, with one trial in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts, the PERSIST-1 trial; and the other in patients with low platelet counts, the PERSIST-2 trial. In August 2014, pacritinib was granted Fast Track designation by the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of intermediate and high risk myelofibrosis including, but not limited to, patients with disease-related thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts); patients experiencing treatment-emergent thrombocytopenia on other JAK2 inhibitor therapy; or patients who are intolerant of or whose symptoms are not well controlled (sub-optimally managed) on other JAK2 therapy.  In May 2015, we announced the final results from PERSIST-1, our Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to BAT (Best Available Therapy), excluding JAK2 inhibitors, which included a broad range of currently utilized treatments, in 327 patients with myelofibrosis regardless of the patients' platelet counts. The study included patients with severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Patients were randomized to receive 400 mg pacritinib once daily or BAT, excluding JAK2 inhibitors. The trial met its primary endpoint of spleen volume reduction (SVR) (35 percent or greater from baseline to Week 24 by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT)). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea and nausea) and anemia.  In February 2016, clinical studies under the investigational new drug (IND) for pacritinib were subject to a full clinical hold issued by the FDA. A full clinical hold is a suspension of the clinical work requested under the IND application. Under the full clinical hold, all patients currently on pacritinib were required to discontinue pacritinib immediately and no patients could be enrolled or start pacritinib as initial or crossover treatment. In its written notification, the FDA cited the reasons for the full clinical hold were that it noted interim overall survival results from the PERSIST-2 Phase 3 trial showing a detrimental effect on survival consistent with the results from PERSIST-1.  In February 2016, prior to the clinical hold, we completed patient enrollment in the PERSIST-2 Phase 3 clinical trial. Under the full clinical hold, all patients participating in the PERSIST-2 clinical trial discontinued pacritinib treatment.  In August 2016, we announced the top-line results from PERSIST-2, our Phase 3 trial of pacritinib for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter. Three hundred eleven (311) patients were enrolled in the study, which formed the basis for the safety analysis. Two hundred twenty-one (221) patients had a chance to reach Week 24 (the primary analysis time point) at the time the clinical hold was imposed and constituted the intent-to-treat analysis population utilized for the evaluation of efficacy. Results demonstrated that the PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints showing a statistically significant response rate in SVR in patients with myelofibrosis treated with pacritinib compared to BAT, including the approved JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. The co-primary endpoint of reduction of Total Symptom Score (TSS) was not achieved but trended toward improvement in TSS. There was no significant difference in overall survival across treatment arms, censored at the time of clinical hold. The most common treatment-emergent AEs, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia) and were generally less frequent for twice-daily (BID) versus once-daily (QD) administration. Details of the trial were presented in a late-breaking oral session at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2016.  In January 2017, the FDA removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both PERSIST-1 and 2 trials and a dose-exploration clinical trial protocol that the FDA requested. At that time, we announced that we intend to conduct a new trial, PAC203, that plans to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with primary myelofibrosis who have failed prior ruxolitinib therapy to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy (SVR at 12 and 24 weeks) of three dose regimens: 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID and  200 mg BID. The 200 mg BID dose regimen was used in PERSIST-2. The Company expects to initiate the trial in the second quarter of 2017.  The Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for pacritinib was submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in February 2016 with an indication statement based on the PERSIST-1 trial data. In its initial assessment report, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) determined that the current application is not approvable at this point in the review cycle because of major objections in the areas of efficacy, safety (hematological and cardiovascular toxicity) and the overall risk-benefit profile of pacritinib. Subsequent to the filing of the MAA, data from the second phase 3 trial of pacritinib, PERSIST-2, were reported. These data suggest that pacritinib may show clinical benefit in patients who have failed or are intolerant to ruxolitinib therapy, a population for which there is no approved therapy.  Following discussions with the EMA about how PERSIST-2 data might address the major objections and how to integrate the data into the current application, we have decided to withdraw the MAA. We are preparing a new MAA that seeks to address the major objections by including data from PERSIST-2 that will focus on patients with baseline platelet counts less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter, including patients with prior exposure to JAK2 inhibitor therapy. We plan to submit this application mid-year 2017.  Other Pipeline Candidates  Our earlier stage product candidate, tosedostat, is a novel oral, once-daily aminopeptidase inhibitor that has demonstrated significant responses in patients with AML. It is currently being evaluated in several Phase 2 cooperative group-sponsored trials and investigator-sponsored trials. These trials are evaluating tosedostat in combination with hypomethylating agents in AML and MDS, which are cancers of the blood and bone marrow. We anticipate data from these signal-finding trials may be used to determine an appropriate design for a Phase 3 trial.  Management and Board of Directors  In February 2017, we announced the appointment of Adam Craig, M.D., Ph.D., as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and member of the Board of Directors effective March 20, 2017. Dr. Craig has over 20 years of experience in hematology, oncology and drug development in both the US and Europe. Dr. Craig worked as an independent consultant providing strategic and operational advice and support to CTI BioPharma and other hematology/oncology biotechnology companies. Prior to consulting, Dr. Craig was Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and Executive Vice President of Development at Sunesis Pharmaceuticals from 2012 to 2016. From 2008 to 2012, Dr. Craig was CMO and Senior Vice President of Chemgenex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Dr. Craig is a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (UK) and undertook Post-Graduate Training in Pediatrics and Pediatric Oncology. Dr. Craig earned his Bachelor's and Medical degrees from Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, University of London and holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Oncology from Leeds University in the U.K. and an MBA from the Open Business School, in the U.K. Dr. Craig recently served as a Product Development Reviewer for the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas.  In January 2017, we announced that Michael A. Metzger was appointed a Director of CTI BioPharma. Mr. Metzger is currently president and chief operating officer of Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a publicly traded immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company. Mr. Metzger served as president and chief executive officer of Regado Biosciences, Inc., a former publicly traded biotechnology company, from 2013 to 2015, where he oversaw the company's successful merger with Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. in 2015 and acted as an advisor to Tobira during its subsequent sale to Allergan in 2016. Previously, Mr. Metzger served as executive vice president and chief operating officer at Mersana Therapeutics, a privately held biotechnology company developing novel immunoconjugate therapies for cancer, from 2011 to 2013 and in senior business development positions including leading mergers and acquisitions at Forest Laboratories, Inc. from 2006 to 2011. Mr. Metzger served as vice president corporate development at Onconova Therapeutics, Inc., from 2001 until 2006, and was a managing director at MESA Partners, Inc., a venture capital firm, from 1997 to 2001.  Financial Summary  Our revenues are generated from a combination of PIXUVRI sales and collaboration and license agreements. Collaboration revenues reflect the earned amount of upfront payments and milestone payments under our product collaborations. Total revenues were $0.8 million and $36.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $19.3 million, compared to income from operations of $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, you should not rely on them as being indicative of our future performance.  As of March 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $33.3 million.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Product sales, net. We sell PIXUVRI primarily through a limited number of wholesale distributors. Servier is responsible for distribution of PIXUVRI in the respective countries in its territory. We generally record product sales upon receipt of the product by the health care provider or distributor at which time title and risk of loss pass.  Product sales, net include royalty revenue as well as a provision for distributor discounts, estimated government-mandated discounts and rebates, trade discounts and estimated product returns. Product sales, net from PIXUVRI were $0.7 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and included royalty revenue of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. No royalty revenue was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in product sales, net of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from the respective period in 2016 was primarily related to pricing and volume variances between the periods presented as well as the decline in average exchange rate of the euro for our euro-denominated sales and the average exchange rate of the British pound for our pound-denominated sales.  The provision for product returns relates to a limited right of return or replacement that we offer to certain customers. Distributor discounts, returns and rebates were $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 while no material amount was recorded for the same period in 2016. During the periods presented, there were no other material payments and credits applied towards provision for discounts, rebates and other for current or prior period sales.  Gross sales is defined as our contracted reimbursement price in each country. Gross sales from PIXUVRI were $0.7 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Any expansion of our commercial operations in the E.U. (including with regard to sales of PIXUVRI) may increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Future revenues, if any, are dependent on market acceptance of PIXUVRI, the reimbursement decisions made by governmental authorities in each country where PIXUVRI is available for sale and other factors. License and Contract Revenues   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Baxalta Milestone and license revenue $ - $ 32,000 Development services revenue - 2,876 Total Baxalta revenue - 34,876 Servier Milestone and license revenue - - Development services revenue 68 376 Total Servier revenue 68 376  Total license and contract revenue $ 68 $ 35,252  Baxalta  In October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement with Baxalta Incorporated and its affiliates, or Baxalta, which is now part of Shire plc. As such, we will no longer be eligible to receive cost sharing or milestone payments for pacritinib's development from Baxalta.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded milestone revenue of $32.0 million. We received the cash advance for these milestone payments in the second quarter of 2015; it was accounted for as long-term debt until the achievement of the associated milestones in the first quarter of 2016. No such milestone payments were received during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement as discussed above.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recorded $2.9 million of development services revenue, of which $2.7 million was related to the reimbursable development costs from Baxalta under the terms of the Pacritinib License Agreement and $0.2 million was related to the upfront payment we received in connection with the execution of the Pacritinib License Agreement in 2013. No such revenue was recorded during the same period in 2017 due to the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement as discussed above.  For additional information relating to the Pacritinib License Agreement, see Part I, Item 2, "License Agreements and Milestone Activities - Baxalta".  Servier  In February 2016, we entered into an agreement with one of Servier's affiliates whereby we are to conduct a pharmacokinetic sub-study on behalf of Servier in conjunction with our ongoing clinical trial, PIX-306. In relation to this study, we recorded $42,000 and $0.4 million of expense reimbursements as development services revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We recognized $26,000 of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relating to development services allocated from the upfront payment we received in connection with the agreement in place with Servier. The remaining deferred revenue balance was $0.6 million as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In addition, the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2017 included a $0.2 million prepayment related to the pharmacokinetic sub-study. There was no such prepayment as of December 31, 2016.  For additional information on our collaboration with Servier, see Part I, Item 2, "License Agreements and Milestone Activities - Servier".  Operating costs and expenses  Cost of product sold. Cost of product sold is related to sales of PIXUVRI. Cost of product sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of product sold was primarily related to a decline in quantity of inventory sold between periods in addition to a decline in the euro between periods. This was partially offset by an increase in the per unit cost of product sold related to the product mix of the reduced-cost inventory.  We began capitalizing costs related to the production of PIXUVRI in February 2012 upon receiving a positive opinion for conditional marketing authorization by the EMA's CHMP. While we tracked the quantities of individual PIXUVRI product lots, we did not track manufacturing costs prior to capitalization and, therefore, the manufacturing cost of PIXUVRI produced prior to capitalization is not reasonably determinable. We expect approximately half of this reduced-cost inventory will be available for us to use commercially and to fulfill expected demand under the Restated Agreement with Servier. Accordingly, we have reserved $1.5 million of existing inventory expected to be unsalable as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The timing of the sales of such reduced-cost inventory and its impact on gross margin is dependent on the level of PIXUVRI sales as well as our ability to utilize this inventory prior to its expiration date.We expect that our cost of product sold as a percentage of product sales may increase in future periods as PIXUVRI product manufactured and expensed prior to capitalization is sold; however, such future cost trend will ultimately depend on several factors in the near term, including, but not limited to, the consumption rate and availability of reduced cost inventory, the effect of expiring inventory and applicable manufacturing pricing structures (which will depend, in part, on the particular drug substance manufacturers we select.)  Research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses for compounds under development and preclinical development were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Compounds: PIXUVRI $ 2,065 $ 3,503 Pacritinib 4,105 11,625 Opaxio 3 26 Tosedostat 106 377 Operating expenses 2,953 4,932 Research and preclinical development 21 383 Total research and development expenses $ 9,253 $ 20,846  Costs for our compounds include external direct expenses such as principal investigator fees, charges from contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing fees incurred for preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and regulatory activities associated with preparing the compounds for submissions of NDAs or similar regulatory filings to the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. and Europe, as well as upfront license fees for acquired technology. Subsequent to receiving a positive opinion for conditional approval of PIXUVRI in the E.U. from the EMA's CHMP, costs associated with commercial batch production, quality control, stability testing, and certain other manufacturing costs of PIXUVRI were capitalized as inventory. Operating expenses include our personnel and an allocation of occupancy, depreciation and amortization expenses associated with developing these compounds. Research and preclinical development costs primarily include costs associated with external laboratory services associated with the compound under development by Aequus Biopharma, Inc. We are not able to capture the total cost of each compound because we do not allocate operating expenses to all of our compounds. External direct costs incurred by us as of March 31, 2017 were $122.5 million for PIXUVRI (excluding costs prior to our 2004 merger with Novuspharma S.p.A, formerly a public pharmaceutical company located in Italy), $119.2 million for pacritinib (excluding costs for pacritinib prior to our acquisition of certain assets from S*BIO, in May 2012 and $29.1 million of in-process research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of certain assets from S*BIO), $228.0 million for Opaxio and $14.0 million for tosedostat (excluding costs for tosedostat prior to our co-development and license agreement with Chroma Therapeutics Limited, or Chroma, in 2011 and $21.9 million of in-process research and development expenses associated with the acquisition of certain assets from Chroma).  Research and development expenses decreased to $9.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $20.8 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in pacritinib development costs as a result of the full clinical hold, a decrease in operating expenses primarily attributed to personnel costs associated with a reduction in average headcount between periods, and a reduction in PIX306 comparator drug purchases between periods.  Regulatory agencies, including the FDA and EMA, regulate many aspects of a product candidate's life cycle, including research and development and preclinical and clinical testing. We will need to commit significant time and . . .  May 03, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
