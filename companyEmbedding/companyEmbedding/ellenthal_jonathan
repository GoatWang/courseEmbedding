Greetings and welcome to the Patent Properties’ First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kara Jenny, Chief Financial Officer for Patent. Thank you, Ms. Jenny. You may now begin.
Kara Jenny
Thank you and good afternoon. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement, which was released prior to this call. The earnings release and the related 8-K we filed earlier today may also be found on our website at patentproperties.com.
Before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements based on management's expectations, estimates and projections as of today. The forward-looking statements in our discussion are subject to various assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer all of you to our recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact the future operating results and financial condition of Patent Properties, Inc. We disclaim any intentions or obligations to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law.
I would now like to introduce Jay Walker, Executive Chairman of Patent Properties, Inc.
Jay Walker
Thank you, Kara and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I am here with our CEO, Jon Ellenthal and our CFO, Kara Jenny, both of whom will participate in the call and be available for Q&A.
Jon and I will provide an update on the launch of the United States Patent Utility. Kara, will then take us briefly through the first quarter financials as well as our recent patent enforcement efforts. After these presentations we’ll leave plenty of time for Q&A.
We mentioned on our last call that we publicly launched the United States Patent Utility in late January after a brief beta period. After more than a year of product and technical development it was great to release the service to the marketplace and begin to get feedback from live customers.
In January we were very excited, today four short months later we’ve been more excited and more importantly four months smarter about the scale market opportunity and what it will take to build a very valuable business. We’re paying careful attention to the feedback of our early users. In particular we’re interested in those aspects of our service the market finds most useful that way we can feature these benefits in our ongoing sales efforts and prioritize product enhancements.
We are guided by the experience of having created several businesses that relied on fresh thinking to bring a brand-new capability to market and scale those businesses to positions of industry leadership. Those experiences have thought us the value of soaking up early learning’s that can be used to put the company on a trajectory for large-scale market adoption.
For those of you who are new to our business let me give you a brief overview of the problem we are solving and how we plan to solve it. There is unprecedented pressure on companies to improve product and service performance, improve product quality, differentiate products from competitive offerings, take costs out of products, bring new products to market faster, track competitors and manage technology risk.

In today's environment of global competition in an economy dominated by lightning fast technology cycles it's a struggle for companies to quickly figure out what new materials, new technologies, new approaches and even new competitors need to be considered. It’s no longer feasible for companies to rely solely on their internal resources and employees to stay ahead of competitors.
Instead companies need to connect to people and organizations that can do things they can’t. We believe the company's private network of external resources needs to grow exponentially to stay on top of what's new, who is new and what matters. That’s why we’ve created a service that makes it simple and affordable for any company to efficiently access the external capabilities and insights of experts and the organizations they work for.
When you consider that for every dollar a company spends trying to solve an internal problem the world spends thousands of dollars on the same or similar problem. It makes sense to figure out how to tap into the world's R&D budget for internal use. We also use our advanced software to help our customers keep track of competitive activities and better understand the potential threats of third-party technologies. Our service combines the power of big data software engines and a novel view of the problem-solving capacity of the U.S. patent database to help companies compete, grow and manage risk.
The U.S. patent database is the largest collection of technical knowledge and technology experts in the world by far and we view each patent as an advertisement. For the deeper capabilities and expertise of the inventor and the inventor’s organization. Only a fraction of what an investor knows about a particular subject is found in any given patent. The rest resides inside their head and inside the inventor’s organization.
Our job is to match problems to people and organizations using advanced software and to unlock the massively underutilized commercial problem-solving capacity of the U.S. patent database. That’s what we believe we have developed. The service is available to companies for a monthly subscription fee. We believe even a modest penetration of the target market would create a significant recurring revenue stream and a very valuable business.
With that introduction, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO Jon Ellenthal. Jon?
Jonathan Ellenthal
Thanks Jay. As you just heard to work on a problem that is experienced by virtually every company in our economy and we have seen strong evidence of that fact by the tremendous range of growth driver we are working with and others that have expressed interest in trialing the service.
We are now serving companies and industries as diverse the software, consumer product, industrial supplies, marketing analytics, insurance, gaming, consumer electronics and healthcare and the market is not only broad, but also deep. Although originally developed with a small and midsized business in mind, we have been pleasantly surprised by the interest shown by very large companies.
In addition to Microsoft and Harman International, we recently added Reinsurance Group of America Inc., a multi-billion dollar global reinsurance company to our client roster. Discussions and trials are underway with a number of other high profile Fortune 1000 companies as well as dozens of smaller and midsize firms.
Our ability to serve giant companies adds to what was already a large total addressable market. In general giant companies tend to have a more sophisticated understanding of their needs to have expertise and insights from people outside the company and somehow formally organized around this effort.
We see the interest from giant companies as further validation of the market size as well as the uniqueness of our approach. The U.S. patent database is often misunderstood as purely a source of legal rights and risk rather than the greater information sharing and knowledge transfer mechanism ever created.

Leading a [giant] property rights the metadata is a valuable source of business intelligence that can help the company to solve product problems faster and key tabs on competitors investments. At this base we are focused on building the sales infrastructure will need for scale our initial in-house telesales operation is in play to handle outbound and inbound leads and we plan to build on that base. We are also investing in a variety of media, messages and targets to determine the best marketing mix.
The sales pipeline is filling up nicely, we are learning more everyday about lead conversion rates, the length of the sale cycle and acquisition costs. We have been active on the speaker circuit and with telesales, conference sponsorships, online media, content marketing, webinars and media appearances. In the quarter editorial pieces have appeared in the Harvard Business Review, Fortune Magazine, Industry Week, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Wired Magazine Jenny has appeared on CNBC, Fox News and Bloomberg TV.
As you can see we’re hard at work getting the message out and we’re using business-to-business selling strategies used by other SaaS companies in combination with Jay’s ability to command the media attention. The good news is there a lot of companies to reach and we are committed to building a world-class sales and marketing operation. There's a lot more to come on this front and although we’re only in the first inning of this game we like how things are setting up for us.
Now I’ll turn things over to Kara who will provide an update on our first quarter results.
Kara Jenny
Thanks Jon. We had negligible revenue this quarter, as we historically stated revenue is expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on revolutions to our legal action and as we built customers in the Patent Utility. Once the Patent Utility scales we expect to start building more predictable recurring revenue.
Total operating expenses for the first quarter 2015 were $3.6 million versus $6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $3.3 million decrease in professional fees from prior year period and partially offset by $723,000 increase in other legal and consulting expenses and $143,000 increase related to marketing for the utility. Net loss for the first quarter of 2015 was approximately $4 million and net loss per share was $0.19.
An improvement compared to last year's first-quarter net loss of approximately $6 million or net loss per share of $0.30 per share. From a liquidity standpoint as of March 31, 2015 we had $11.6 million in cash and working capital of $10.3 million and no outstanding debt on our balance sheet. On the litigation enforcement side of our business, the landscape for Patent litigation changes constantly and remains a long cycle business.
These factors provide us with very limited visibility, the practice of attempting to invalidate patents as an early defense tactics has been a common one and serves to further flow the court process. We continue to believe that our Patent portfolio has strong economic value and can create long-term shareholder value. We have a strong history of creating IP value and we will remain flexible in terms of how we ultimately monetize our portfolio.
We have the capital and willingness to take any case to its ultimate outcome in court. So we remain open and regularly talk to third parties regarding settlements, licensing arrangements, in individual and bulk asset sales just as we’ve done in the past. In addition, we are willing to consider ways to convert existing defendants into supporters of the Patent Utility if we determine doing so creates more long-term shareholder value.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Jon.
Jonathan Ellenthal
Great, thanks Kara. To conclude our prepared remarks, we are pleased with the first few months of the United States Patent Utility. We live in a world that is innovating faster than any one company can keep up with and every company is under constant pressure to improve its products and services faster and cheaper than competitors.

More and more solutions will come from outside the firm and those companies that can efficiently and consistently tap into external innovation will be in the strongest position to maintain and build market share.
The U.S. Patent database is a massively underutilized competitive resource with the United States Patent Utility and our proprietary software, we are determined to change that and to help American companies compete and grow.
And with that I thank you for your time and would like to open the call for Q&A. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. The first question is from Don Hickman of Ladenburg. Please go ahead.
Jon Hickman
Good afternoon. I have few questions, thanks for taking my call. Could you give us some idea of how many patents are in the database right now?
Jonathan Ellenthal
Well, we’re going to call you, Jon Hickman if that's okay, Jon.
Jon Hickman
Okay. That’s fine.
Jonathan Ellenthal
It makes sense. Anyway, yes I think what we said publicly is that there are several thousand patents currently listed in the utilities catalog at this point.
Jon Hickman
Several thousand, okay. And could you give us some idea of the size of subscriber base and the size of the people that are contributing to the patent database?
Jonathan Ellenthal
Are you looking for the types of institutions that are contributing?
Jon Hickman
No I was looking for a number like is a dozen or a couple dozen subscribers. I know its early days, but I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit?
Jonathan Ellenthal
Sure. I mean it’s definitely early days, we haven't actually characterized the number of different organizations that are listing patents at this point Jon. I expect we’ll in the future, but since it's so early we have not at this point chosen to reveal that information. There are multiple contributors and ultimately the size and diversity that the overall patent count and the range of patents in there will matter a most, so the arrangement we had announced earlier with intellectual ventures is a particularly interesting one because I don't think there is anybody out there that owns a more diverse number and more diverse range of patents given how their portfolio was assembled.
Jon Hickman
Okay. So and then could you elaborate just a little bit more on, you said you have in-house like the telesales team is up and running and then your next move is to do more of a direct sales organization. Do you have anybody in the direct sales organization at this point or is that in the future?
Jonathan Ellenthal
Yes, so let me just clarify our statement. We have an in-house telesales operation, their job primarily is to work on outbound leads as well as inbound leads that are created by our marketing organization. The marketing organization goes out there and does a whole wide range of promotions in various media, online media events to generate inbound leads, which are also followed-up on by our in-house telesales organization.
We do have a head of business development that we added to the team a few months back and a big part of that person's role is to explore channel partnerships with other organizations that may give us expedited access to large groups of customers. So what’s in place today is the group that works on acquiring subscribers one at a time through telesales operation and hopefully as time goes by and our business development resources grow will be able to figure out ways to acquire customers in bulk. We also as you know do quite a bit of media outreach to supplement our sales and marketing efforts which is why Jay has printing on TV so much.
Jon Hickman
So could you give us an idea of how this latest large company insurance, the reinsurance came to that how did you get a hold of that?

Jonathan Ellenthal
Well, I think we have a bit of a relationship that you are referring to Reinsurance Group of America.
Jon Hickman
Yes, the one…
Jay Walker
Walker Digital hazard has a relationship.
Jonathan Ellenthal
Yes, what Jay just mentioned Jon, Walker Digital has a relationship with RGA and we are introduced to them through that relationship.
Jon Hickman
Okay. I think that's it from me. Jon I appreciate you’re taking my questions.
Jonathan Ellenthal
Our pleasures Jon.
End of Q&A
Operator
I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Jonathan Ellenthal
Now we appreciate your time this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again in a few months to share with you our second quarter results. Thank you very much.
Operator

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
