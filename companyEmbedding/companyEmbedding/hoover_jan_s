Heritage
FROM OUR FAMILY TO YOURS


For over 100 years, we’ve been a part of the family by reimagining the way we clean. From the introduction of the very first electric sweeper in 1908 to the revolutionary WindTunnel® design, it’s in our DNA to relentlessly pursue innovation so you can more easily achieve the best possible clean for you and your family. 


To adapt to today’s homes and the needs of the active family, we created the new Hoover REACT™ vacuum, equipped with advanced, intelligent technology, powerful performance and simple features for an effortless clean anytime and anywhere.
