Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

What are analysts saying about SolarEdge Technologies stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about SolarEdge Technologies stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. provides inverter solution. The company's SolarEdge system offers power optimizers, inverters and a cloud-based monitoring platform. It serves residential solar installations to commercial and small utility-scale solar installations. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. is headquartered in Hod Hasharon, Israel.   " (7/20/2017)
2. FBR & Co analysts commented, "In-line results, solid guidance in a tough market. Yesterday, SEDG delivered C4Q16 results that highlight challenges in its core U.S. residential solar market. C4Q16 revenues of $111.5M were just above the low end of guidance ($110M'$120M), but gross margin of 35.0% exceeded guidance (30%'32%), even after subtracting 200 bps for one-time items. Revenue can mostly be attributed to softness in the U.S. residential market, with muted growth in 2017. However, SEDG indicated strong growth in its U.S. commercial business. C1Q17 revenue guidance of $110M' $120M with 31%'33% gross margin indicates SEDG still prioritizes profitable growth over market share. Management still believes it is gaining market share in every geography in which it operates and expects continued gains, albeit with 35%' 40% U.S. residential share, at a more muted pace than past years. The company's strong financial position permits aggressive investment in product development, geographic expansion, and potential lateral M&A, but we remain on the sidelines until we see evidence of a pickup in the U.S. market or significant international expansion."
