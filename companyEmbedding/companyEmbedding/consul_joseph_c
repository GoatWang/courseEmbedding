MCKINZIE: Mr. Ambassador, you were, I think, in charge of the Legation 
      in Damascus at the time that President Roosevelt died and when President 
      Truman assumed office. Do you have any recollections about what happened 
      on the occasion of President Roosevelt's death, and how the coming to 
      office of a new President affected your outlook and the outlook of the 
      Middle Easterners with whom you had contact? 
      SATTERTHWAITE: Well, yes, I remember it very dramatically because I was 
      in charge of our legation in
[2]
Damascus. The Minister Plenipotentiary George Wadsworth, lived in 
      Beirut, over two ranges of mountains, and when he wasn't in Damascus I was 
      in charge. President Roosevelt had left tremendous impressions throughout 
      the Near East in his war efforts. I had a [condolence] book and all day 
      long people of an amazing variety came to visit me. The Syrian officials 
      came and signed the book. France was still officially the protecting 
      power, and individuals from General [Paul] Beynet down to a corporal, I 
      remember, came in and signed the book.
Most impressive to me were some of the heads of the great tribes, the 
      still nomadic tribes on the great Syrian desert, who came in in their 
      robes, of course, and their abbas and so on. It lasted all day long with 
      an amazing outpouring of emotion. But they knew very little about 
      President Truman as our Vice Presidents aren't very highly publicized 
      overseas as a rule,
[3]
except maybe [Spiro] Agnew now a little more. And so all I could say 
      was that we're never without a President, fortunately, and that our new 
      President is Harry S. Truman.
MCKINZIE: The Middle East seemed to have a particular interest for 
      President Roosevelt. There is some evidence that he wanted to use Iran, 
      perhaps, as a test case for the Atlantic Charter, that here was a place 
      where you could see if it was going to work. Were you aware, at the end of 
      the war, of any expectations on the part of the Syrian Government, or any 
      other Middle Eastern government, about development plans that they might 
      expect the United States to help them with?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, in connection with Iran let's go back to my days 
      in Baghdad, which were just before World War II, and of course, the 
      problem
[4]
we had being close to the border of Iran, and very much in touch with 
      Iranian affairs. After the war, by the time I was in the Office of Near 
      Eastern and African Affairs, the principal Iranian problem was Azerbaijan. 
      The Russians had occupied it, even though they had shared the occupation 
      with the British, but they wouldn't move out of this northern province, 
      and this was one of our greatest problems in '45 and '46. Maybe someone 
      would say it was some other problem, but it seems to me this was the first 
      great success of the United Nations, because in the debates at the 
      Security Council, it was the worldwide publicity that this problem got 
      that in effect forced the Russians finally to pull their troops out of 
      Azerbaijan and leave all of Iran to be governed by the old Shah.
MCKINZIE: May I interject here that President Truman wrote a book, with 
      the help of assistants, after he did his memoirs, in which he contends 
      that he 
      [5]
said to Stalin that he should withdraw the troops from Azerbaijan, or 
      he, Truman, would send the American Mediterranean fleet into the Persian 
      Gulf, and historians have not been able to come up with any document to 
      Premier Stalin, suggesting that that was going to happen. In your own 
      personal recollections...
SATTERTHWAITE: No, I don't have any recollections of that, and it seems 
      to me he would certainly have told Dean Acheson at least, whom he thought 
      so highly of, if it were so. I don't recall it ever having been mentioned 
      in any of our many meetings. But I shouldn't dispute Truman if he said 
      so.
MCKINZIE: But historians have been puzzled that such a document has 
      never been found.
SATTERTHWAITE: Certainly I have no recollection of this. Now, as to 
      sending the fleet into the Persian Gulf, of course, it's still a long way 
      from the Soviet Union. One of our fears always -- 
[6]
and now it can be told -- secretly, was that because of the Russian 
      desire, the Imperial Russian desire, also, to have a warm water port, they 
      might drive down to the Persian Gulf some day. And at one time after World 
      War II we knew they had some airborne divisions poised in the Caucasus. 
      And we were disturbed and took counteraction, to a degree. I don't think 
      there was any real question of our sending ships into the Persian Gulf. We 
      had one old, mother ship there which wouldn't have deterred much of 
      anybody and it would have been almost impossible for us to carry out an 
      action in the Persian Gulf. The kind of action that we would have had to 
      take would have been not of a warlike kind, but, you know, hurting the 
      Russians in all the other ways you could think of economically. I can't 
      imagine how we could have really frightened Stalin, even if we did have a 
      fleet in the Mediterranean.
MCKINZIE: At that time, were you aware of the fact 
[7]
that very many people in Truman's Cabinet and in the military were 
      seeing the Middle East as an increasingly important area? Secretary 
      [Harold] Ickes, for example, got very excited at the end of the war about 
      the oil potential in the Middle East, as, indeed, did Secretary (Robert 
      P.] Patterson, arguing to President Truman at one point that the United 
      States could fight a major world war for only three years without the oil. 
      This seemed to be a kind of new or recent concern, didn't it?
SATTERTHWAITE: I don't remember that, though it may be true. By the 
      time I was Director of the Near Eastern and African Affairs Ickes was 
      concerned about India in one way. Nehru was to make a trip to the U.S. and 
      I remember Ickes got me on the phone about the details of arranging his 
      visit, but I don't remember if anything came of it. It would have had to 
      have come through the
[8]
White House pretty much. Ickes, being Ickes, would have dealt directly 
      with Acheson if he wanted to, I am sure, or with Bob [Robert A.] Lovett 
      probably. Incidentally, I had the greatest admiration for Lovett, as I did 
      for General Marshall, but Lovett was the one that handled the details 
      always. You see Marshall operated like a general with a chief of staff, 
      and Lovett was his chief of staff, and he often used to tell me, "The 
      General and I operate as a team."
MCKINZIE: Mr. Ambassador, what about the theory that the United States 
      didn't fill the power vacuum in the Middle East as fast as it might have 
      with the decline of the French influence, and, indeed, British influence 
      in the Middle East, that were leaving a kind of political turmoil.
SATTERTHWAITE: If you will remember -- you may be too young to -- but 
      the first few months after the war we were demobilizing just as rapidly as 
      we
[9]
could, and I remember Larry [Lauris] Norstad, as a young major general, 
      lecturing to the political officers of the State Department saying how 
      fortunate it was that there were great new problems while we were almost 
      completely disarmed, and so we could build up a new army.
MCKINZIE: You mentioned that when you came back to the State Department 
      in September of 1945 there were a lot of ambassadors coming back from the 
      Middle East, and they found President Truman relatively accessible.
SATTERTHWAITE: That's right.
MCKINZIE: What kind of things were they telling him about the Middle 
      East?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, he was interested in the Middle East. As I said, 
      we were rather surprised how easy it was to make appointments for them. 
      Actually, with one or two exceptions, they were still ministers
[10]
plenipotentiary. The posts were raised to the rank of ambassador maybe 
      in '47 or 48. But anyway, they were our representatives there, and, of 
      course, he was interested in Palestine. But remember that didn't become a 
      real political problem until '47 and I'm talking about the fall of '45 
      now. And he was interested in that area, what to do about it, and what 
      would happen there and what they were like even though a lot of people 
      didn't know the difference between Iraq and Iran, for instance. That was 
      certainly true of this famous general who made so much trouble in China 
      later on -- Patrick Hurley, this picturesque general, who came to the Near 
      East during the last days of the war, and when he was in Baghdad he was 
      talking as if he was in Iran, and I suspect in Teheran about Iraq, but I'm 
      not sure. But we know the Iraqis weren't especially amused that he didn't 
      even know the name of their country.
MCKINZIE: Later, in 1948 and certainly by 1949 there
[11]
was a lot of talk about "the revolution of rising expectations" on the 
      part of the people. Were you involved in that discussion and how to go 
      about fulfilling these expectations that the peoples of the area had?
SATTERTHWAITE: I'm not sure that that problem wasn't written about 
      subsequently, although we were thinking about it at the time. Certainly we 
      had the problem for getting aid. Now the one country that needed it only 
      briefly, of course, was Saudi Arabia. They felt very poor at the end of 
      the war because, of course, they couldn't develop their oil in wartime. 
      But, I still recall -- maybe in the fall of '45 -- being invited to a 
      reception at which champagne was flowing out of a fountain, the sort of 
      thing that you put your cup under. Ibn Saud learned about this later; you 
      know the Saudis were not supposed to drink liquor, and so later on their 
      parties were dry, but this was nice while it lasted.
[12]
Saudi Arabia, of course, is potentially, except for Kuwait I suppose, 
      one of the countries with the highest gross national product per capita in 
      the world. Kuwait, of course, is way ahead of everybody else. I visited 
      Kuwait from my legation in Baghdad in 1937 when the first oil well was 
      going down, before any oil had been discovered. I went out and visited the 
      rig on the desert.
MCKINZIE: It's changed considerably since then.
SATTERTHWATTE: It seems to me rising expectations were certainly a part 
      of the developing world, but it certainly wasn't up on the "front burner," 
      as I recall. And of course, it may be that it was being dealt with 
      elsewhere. I am sure that the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic 
      Affairs didn't spend a great deal of time thinking about the Near East, 
      because we had all the problems of getting Europe started, and then we
[13]
had the Far East; but no doubt they were thinking about this, 
      very much.
MCKINZIE: When the large aid programs began in Europe, some of the 
      developing countries, away from Europe, and I'm thinking specifically of 
      Latin America, did voice some resentment at this "Europe first policy." 
      Did you have to deal with that to any large degree?
SATTERTHWAITE: No, but of course, you see, at first it was Turkey and 
      Greece to begin with, the first great aid program under the Truman 
      Doctrine and then, of course, the Marshall Plan did come out of that. And 
      later on the appropriations for '48 and '49 even, certainly '49-'50, aid 
      for Greece and Turkey was included in the Marshall Plan appropriations. I 
      don't remember being troubled by that in the Near East. Of course, you 
      see, '47 was the year in which India and Pakistan got their independence, 
      and then next year you had Burma and Ceylon and some other 
      [14]
countries; so the first aid programs in other words, had to come from 
      the British Empire and did, to the countries they were giving up. I don't 
      recall that we gave any aid to Ceylon for years. I may be wrong in 
      that.
MCKINZIE: No, we didn't.
SATTERTHWAITE: Certainly not when I was there, from '49 to '53.
MCKINZIE: What then did you conceive to be the greatest problem in 
      maintaining stability of the area? Since it had strategic and economic 
      importance to the United States it would be in the national interest to 
      maintain the stability of the area,
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, are we talking about the immediate postwar period 
      now?
MCKINZIE: Yes, from '45, let's say, through '47.
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, one of the things that disturbed
[15]
us was the expiration of a law permitting us to give military 
      assistance outside of Latin America. We've long had a basic law by which 
      we could send military missions and give military assistance to Latin 
      America, and I accompanied General Marshall soon after he became Secretary 
      of State to an appearance before the House Military Affairs Committee -- 
      probably the only time, almost, that a Secretary of State has appeared 
      before that committee, trying to persuade Congress to extend this 
      legislation. And the House was willing, but the Senate blocked it; Harry 
      Byrd, I think, principally.
General Marshall didn't go to the Senate hearing as perhaps he should 
      have, but anyway this was fascinating because it was like old home week in 
      the House. This committee was so glad to see General Marshall again that 
      it made it very interesting, and, of course, the House Committee under 
      Vinson would give him anything he wanted nearly. The Senate was more 
      stubborn, as it often is.
[16]
MCKINZIE: There was a gap in there between lend-lease and the creation 
      of ECA, that got operating finally in '48. I'm wondering how you felt 
      about the sort of parallel organization of the Economic Cooperation 
      Administration which dealt directly, in most cases, with countries, and 
      the Office of Near Eastern Affairs?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, you see, for those immediately postwar years, in 
      spite of what happened in Syria, when the French lost their heads and 
      bombed Damascus, they continued to give all the aid to Lebanon they 
      needed, and even some to Syria after this episode. The British continued, 
      of course, to support Palestine and then after all it was in '48 before 
      they pulled out of there, so, it was pretty much the former colonial 
      powers which continued to give assistance to the Arab world at that 
      period. When lend-lease really got going, I believe Egypt was the first 
      country to get aid from ECA.
[17]
MCKINZIE: Egypt did get large amounts of ECA aid.
SATTERTHWAITE: Of course, we're also talking about another area -- 
      India and Pakistan -- India, I think, got more than any other country in 
      the end, didn't it?
MCKINZIE: Yes, but it got aid of technical assistance nature and 
      developmental nature.
SATTERTHWAITE: That's right, it did.
MCKINZIE: Did you have any particular feelings when this aid effort 
      started about the kind of aid that would be, one, most effective for the 
      country, and, two, most beneficial for American interests in the Near 
      East?
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, we certainly did think about it, and I kept in 
      close touch with the ECA and the Truman Doctrine group which were giving 
      aid to Greece and Turkey. The actual working out of this 
[18]
aid program was not in what was then the Office of Near Eastern and 
      African Affairs. It was handled instead by the aid part of the Department 
      under various names until it finally became AID. We were very much 
      involved and attended the meetings, of course.
And one of the things Loy Henderson did when he was Director (1945-48), 
      because of this aid program (the Near Eastern Division had included at one 
      time the Balkans as well as the Near East), was to transfer from the Near 
      Eastern Division Greece, Turkey, and Iran, all three of which bordered on 
      Communist countries, and all of which were getting large aid programs, and 
      formed a division of Greek, Turkish and Iranian Affairs. And, of course, 
      they were involved very much in the aid program, whereas the Middle 
      Eastern countries were much less so, except for Palestine, or Israel as it 
      became after '47.
MCKINZIE: Would you say that by 1947 a large percentage of the time of 
      the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs
[19]
was occupied with the Palestinian problem?
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, of the Near Eastern Division certainly. It was so 
      important that there were a lot of people doing nothing else. Every Arab 
      country, of course, was deeply involved in the Palestine problem, felt 
      very strongly and emotionally about it. So the dominant problem up until 
      the recognition of Israel, was the future of Palestine, and after that the 
      problems created by the fact of the existence of Israel.
MCKINZIE: Did the Palestine issue strain the relationship that 
      you had had previously with leaders of Arab governments?
SATTERTHWAITE: Not particularly, because we were career men and while 
      we were loyally carrying out the policy set for us by the President's 
      Secretary of State, we had known and worked with so many of the Arab 
      leaders; and of course their diplomats in Washington, they'd generally get 
      along with
[20]
us. So, while it was certainly difficult for them, it created no 
      particular problem for us,that is, the day by day relations were not 
      affected. There were still good working relations right along no matter 
      how much they disliked our policy toward Israel. And although I was not an 
      Arabist we had in our office quite a number of Arabists whose whole career 
      was dealing with Arabs and who spoke Arabic. Of course, it was not 
      necessary to speak Arabic with their diplomats, all of whom spoke English 
      or French fluently. This changed interestingly enough in the years after 
      World War I. In fact all the representatives of former French areas at the 
      United Nations spoke French for the first three or four years of the 
      United Nations and then gradually changed over to English. There were rare 
      exceptions. Israel used to have one of its delegates who spoke in Spanish. 
      He was a Sephardic, and had come out of Argentina to boot; and so, with 
      his tongue in cheek -- and the Israelis loved having him do
[21]
it because they wanted the Latin-Americans on their side anyway -- he 
      made all his speeches in Spanish.
MCKINZIE: Was there a lively dialogue within the Office of Near Eastern 
      Affairs about resolution of the Palestine problem? I know that some people 
      believed that there was hope for a binational state. Would you 
      characterize that as the dominant view of the Bureau?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, this was the hope, that partition wouldn't 
      be necessary because of the fear of exactly what did happen and has 
      continued to happen. The hope for peace in that part of the world was a 
      binational state we felt, and it may have been a false dream or hope that 
      it could take place, but it was worth the effort certainly. And maybe it 
      could have been worked out except for the unfortunate fact, maybe, that we 
      had the city elections in New York in '47 and the national elections in 
      '48.
[22]
MCKINZIE: You personally think that was so?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, they had an impact, of course, understandably, and 
      we have always accepted this fact. There weren't many Arab votes, you 
      know, and in New York City, after all, the Jewish vote was of greatest 
      importance to both parties. I can't remember exactly the timing, but my 
      recollection is that Bevin, probably on the eve of the '47 election in New 
      York City, in a confidential telegram to the President, expressed the hope 
      that in a speech he, the President was about to make, he wouldn't ask for 
      more than 50 thousand additional Jewish emigrants to Palestine. 
      Nevertheless, he came out in a speech not two hours later for a hundred 
      thousand, and Governor [Thomas E.] Dewey made a speech in New York City 
      the next day advocating 200 thousand. So you can see this was a domestic 
      problem in a very big way. The impact of that, I think, probably as much 
      as anything made a binational state impossible.
[23]
I think we still might have had one on 50 thousand more. Maybe this 
      would never have worked, but we thought it was certainly worth trying.
MCKINZIE: Was any other solution to the Jewish refugee problem 
      seriously considered by the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs?
SATTERTHWAITE: Not that I can recall. You see people talked about, "Why 
      not go to Kenya, that's a great area;" but it was perfectly clear, it 
      wasn't just a question of going someplace; after all it was the fact that 
      their homeland was Israel and that was where they wanted to go; not just 
      to go anywhere where they could make a living.
Of course, one of the anomalies, is that relatively few American Jews 
      actually have settled in Israel. And I think the Zionists groups have felt 
      that Israel is much better off with the ethnic Jews remaining in the 
      United States where
[24]
they could keep the money flowing into Israel, which they have done 
      with great success. There have been a few thousand American Jews who 
      settled in Israel. I don't know what the number is, you may?
MCKINZIE: It is not large. When Israel was finally formed there was a 
      huge Arab refugee problem, which must have caused some interesting 
      maneuvering in your office.
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, and of course, as you will recall, they were put in 
      the Gaza Strip, and we thought it would have been better if we could have 
      put more in these great vacant places in Syria, but it didn't work out 
      that way.
MCKINZIE: Do you recall why? I am not familiar with the reason.
SATTERTHWAITE: No, I think that the Arabs wanted it the other way. But 
      anyway, you know about the eleven Jews killed at the Olympic Games. 
      Remember,
[25]
these Arabs boys who did it were born in the Arab refugee centers, and 
      brought up with this hatred in their hearts from children that they had 
      been put out of their homeland.
MCKZNZIE: Was there some recognition of the fact that that might happen 
      at the time?
SATTERTHWAITE: Why, I think so; but of course one couldn't know. This 
      was 25 years later; but they were brought up in these camps and had the 
      hatred instilled in them at having been displaced from their homeland.
MCKINZIE: There was a United Nations mission sent to the Middle East in 
      1949, as I recall, headed by Gordon Clapp.
SATTERTHWAITE: That's right.
MCKINZIE: Did you have any connection with that?
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, we were very much involved and there was one very 
      prominent Democratic politician
[26]
also on that mission. It's a shame not to remember his name; he was 
      very important, and still is, in the Democratic Party. Of course their 
      recommendations couldn't be carried out, if I recall. In any event it was 
      worth the effort, certainly.
MCKINZIE: Well, they did recommend economic developments, projects, and 
      even some work programs for the refugees.
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, that's right.
MCKINZIE: Did you have the impression that Secretary Marshall, and 
      later Acheson, conceived of the Middle Eastern problem as primarily a 
      United Nations problem or a U.S. problem?
SATTERTHWAITE: They would have loved to have made it a United Nations 
      problem; but of course, as the top politicians of Jewish faith in the 
      Democratic Party could get to see the President and anybody they wanted to 
      immediately, it really
[27]
became more than that, of necessity.
MCKINZIE: Well, I'm thinking specifically of these development 
      schemes.
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, and I think it would have been much better to have 
      the U.N. do it. In this connection the Israeli representatives for several 
      years, you know, couldn't talk to the delegates whether in a subcommittee 
      or the main committees on either side of them, because they were always 
      Arabs. This was before the year we got so many new members, and the 
      problem was solved for them. Oh, I've forgotten the year now, but 
      fortunately for them, the new delegates on each side of them were no 
      longer Arabs. I used to watch before that. Every time the Israel 
      representative had to go to the bathroom, for example, and there wasn't 
      anybody else sitting behind him, he had to take all of his papers with 
      him. This was at the Security Council meetings of course, not at the 
      General
[28]
Assembly.
MCKINZIE: How did you happen to get appointed as the head of the 
      special mission to Nepal?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, I was available, I guess. It was exceedingly 
      interesting. Loy Henderson, whom you're seeing -- incidentally (I believe 
      he's been working on this problem for his memoirs and will be much more au 
      courant) will be better prepared than I to tell you. I should have, but I 
      haven't taken time, with other things I'm doing, to go back and review the 
      records, which involves going to the National Archives now. I had done it 
      for an article on the Truman Doctrine, and I have access there; but I'm 
      doing other things, so I haven't reviewed the literature and as I've told 
      you, I believe, I never kept personal papers of classified nature. And 
      practically everything was classified in those days, rightly or 
      wrongly.
[29]
MCKINZIE: Could you narrate for the record a little bit of what 
      happened on this special mission to Nepal?
SATTERTHWAITE: Oh, yes, I have lots of material on that; and I wrote an 
      article for the Foreign Service Journal about it too, in, maybe, 
      August 1947. But this was probably one of the most fascinating missions in 
      my service in the sense that it meant opening up relations with a country 
      which had been, literally, almost completely isolated for one hundred 
      years and that's the way they wanted it -- the ruling Rana family. The 
      reason they asked the United States to send the mission was that they 
      finally became convinced that the British in August 1947 were really 
      leaving India.
So they decided they didn't want to be completely dependent on India 
      and "let's open relations with another power." And, of course, at that 
      time the United States was the dominant power in the world militarily, and 
      in many other
[30]
ways, and so they asked us to send the mission.
I happened to be available; I was on Loy Hendersons staff. We had a 
      very good group going out. Ray [Raymond A.] Hare, who later became 
      director for Near Eastern and African Affairs, went with me. Hare was in 
      Washington, and he was about to become the chief, I guess it still was, of 
      the Division of South Asian Affairs, later the Office. So after going to 
      Nepal with me, he visited this new area, the consulates in India and what 
      in a few months became Pakistan. This is April '47, and the partition of 
      India was in August of '47. And we did have the privilege of seeing India 
      in the last days of the raj and having luncheon with the Mountbattens, "a 
      small intimate luncheon" of about 50 people with bearers behind every 
      chair in magnificent uniforms, and ADC's flying around. We were seeing the 
      last days of the splendor of the British Empire.
And the Mountbattens were interested in my mission because he had been 
      to Nepal. But, the
[31]
British in general, couldn't get beyond the Tarsi, the lowlands, and 
      were seldom allowed into the Valley of Nepal. Nevertheless the British had 
      a Resident Minister there. Moreover in spite of the fact that the Minister 
      clearly realized that my mission meant the eventual end of the exclusive 
      control of Nepal by the British, he was very helpful to me. And when our 
      communications broke down he let me send coded messages through his office 
      to New Delhi, and I had a chance to tell him some years later, "At least 
      my mission meant that you got promoted from minister to ambassador," which 
      it did. And I had the pleasure of entertaining him when I was Ambassador 
      in Ceylon a few years later, when he finally left Nepal. And he also was 
      knighted.
MCKINZIE: I take it there were considerable formalities in connection 
      with this.
SATTERTHWAITE: Always. This was out of this world because one could 
      only think that probably this
[32]
was the way it was in Calcutta 50 years before, before the British 
      moved the capital to New Delhi. All the splendor and everything. And of 
      course, I kept thinking of my secondhand Ford back in Washington while I 
      was taking the rounds with these beautiful, almost magnificent, coaches 
      and four for each of us, with most magnificent uniforms, and the 
      outriders. There would be six horses pulling the carriages. And Durbars, 
      which you read about in Indian history everyday. And finally signing the 
      agreement of friendship and commerce at the auspicious hour fixed by the 
      Hindu priest, which was at 2:13 in the afternoon, with a hundred and one 
      guns going off for the maharajah and seventeen for me.
No, this was unique, and I have to thank Loy Henderson again for asking 
      me to head the mission.
MCKINZIE: What was the residue of the mission?
[33]
SATTERTHWAITE: Ray Hare went out with me from Washington. In New Delhi 
      the Economic Counselor, Sam Day, and Lieutenant Colonel Hosket, the 
      Assistant Military Attache, joined the mission and I got a vice-consul, J. 
      Jefferson Jones, in Bombay, who had already visited Nepal with George 
      Merrill, who was acting U.S. commissioner in Delhi. And I picked up a 
      vice-consul clerk in Karachi, which was still part of India, to act as 
      secretary. Let's see, in addition to Day and Hare and Hosket, we also had 
      Bill Johnstone, who was in the Public Affairs Office in New Delhi.
And we had three bearers (servants), one Christian, one Hindu, and one 
      Moslem; and when we got to Raxaul on the frontier the Maharajah had a 
      private railroad of about 25 miles, and so we rode in great splendor in 
      this. Then we were taken in cars for the next 25 miles to a rest-house 
      where we spent the night. And there we picked up over a hundred bearers, 
      because we had
[34]
to be carried in sedan chairs, seven of them, and hundreds of porters, 
      and with lanterns at night it was a sight to remember, until we got to his 
      rest-house up in the hills. Then from there on we declined riding in the 
      sedan chairs, until we got over the second range and were coming into the 
      Valley of Nepal and they asked us as a favor to ride down in them, because 
      we either preferred to ride the ponies or walk.
What a beautiful part of the world it is. It was the wrong time of year 
      to see Mount Everest, but the mountains cleared just at one time for a 
      glimpse, and I never saw it again until I got to Darjeeling when I was 
      Ambassador in Burma and went to Darjeeling on a short vacation.
MCKINZIE: Then would you talk a little about your work in Ceylon 
      between 1949 and 1953?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, yes, of course, President Truman was my President, 
      and Ceylon was a beautiful
[35]
remote place where I pretty much called the signals if I wanted to, 
      until June of '50 when the fighting in Korea broke out. Then, of course, 
      Ceylon became of some importance as a fueling station for our naval 
      vessels, and liberty for the sailors. We didn't send troops that way, but 
      the Mediterranean fleet would go out from time to time and go back again. 
      We had sometimes an aircraft carrier, mostly one cruiser and maybe four or 
      even eight destroyers. Of course the Ceylonese thought it was fine because 
      they were there for the day, spent a lot of money, had a wonderful time, 
      and were well-behaved, our sailors -- no troops going that way.
MCKINZIE: Did you have extended discussions with the Ceylonese 
      Government about development plans for Ceylon? Were they interested in 
      that to the point where they were willing to make formal application for 
      it?
SATTERTHWAITE: No, because they had the Colombo plan
[36]
from 1950.
MCKINZIE: I wonder if you would talk about that for a while.
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, you see, in 1947 India and Pakistan, and in 1948 
      Ceylon, all got their independence under the "Commonwealth" and the 
      question was how the British would continue to aid. And they had the 
      Colombo conference of Commonwealth foreign ministers in Colombo in January 
      1950, and I had presented credentials in November '49. So Ernie [Ernest] 
      Bevin, the Foreign Minister of Britain, Percy Spender and all these people 
      showed up in Colombo, which most people didn't know much about, except 
      maybe for Lipton tea bags which had a map of Ceylon. This was a tremendous 
      occasion, and Sir Percy Spender, whom I saw quite a bit of during this 
      conference and who later was Ambassador in Washington, was quite annoyed, 
      because during the first or second afternoon of the meetings J.R. 
      Jayawardene, the finance minister of Ceylon,
[37]
asked to speak, and he pulled a speech out of his pocket and stole Sir 
      Percy's thunder, because he was going to propose a Colombo 
plan.
But anyway, I remember Percy walking up and down with scotch in his 
      hand in his hotel room talking, "that damn" -- he's a colorful character 
      as Australians often are. And this was fascinating, because we weren't 
      involved; but I entertained all of them except Nehru, and this is a long 
      story, he sent his number two.
I was the only ambassador, the others were high commissioners, so this 
      was the only time in history, I suppose, that from the moment I presented 
      credentials I was dean of the diplomatic corps, and this changed, because 
      the Canadians didn't want any of this damn nonsense that an ambassador had 
      precedence over a high commissioner. But the Foreign Office in England 
      correctly said this is true, that a high commissioner can't present 
      credentials to the Queen, he is representing the
[38]
Queen, you see. But anyway, the pressures came from India and Australia 
      and never again was an ambassador, so far as I know, at the head of the 
      diplomatic corps in any of the Commonwealth countries.
MCKINZIE: How long did this last?
SATTERTHWAITE: Oh, I don't know, but anyway it did mean that I was dean 
      of the corps during the Colombo Plan Conference, but I entertained the 
      high commissioner and we weren't involved; and I was only invited to the 
      final session which was the only public session.
I was of some help during the conference to Percy Spender, but 
      especially to Mike Pearson of Canada. And the last day he made a speech, 
      and I remember his saying he thought it was only fair that there should be 
      at least one speech in a North American accent, and he didn't say 
      Canadian. We also had great numbers of correspondents.
[39]
They soon formed together in two non-competing groups which shared the 
      information they picked up. But I formally got most of my information from 
      Pearson and Spender. I was told that Roger Makins, who was British 
      Minister in Washington, would keep me informed. So I got in touch with him 
      and he said, "Well, we had a meeting of our delegation the last night and 
      it was decided that this was really a family [Commonwealth] problem. So 
      I'm sorry I won't be able to help you."
As a result I went to see Spender and Pearson and first thing Spender 
      said, "We know we should keep no secrets from the United States, but we 
      have to depend on the United States for our security." And Pearson said, 
      "After all, I've got all these newspapermen, I got to tell them what's 
      going on, so I can certainly tell you, from the Canadian standpoint." We 
      were only very indirectly involved in the Conference but naturally we 
      wanted to know what was going on,
[40]
and with their assistance I could tell the State Department of 
      developments.
One of the interesting by-products was, that we only had old strip 
      codes then in Ceylon, which nobody had ever heard much about. But the 
      Colombo Conference put us on the map and I got coding machines out and all 
      kinds of things as a result of this conference, and we got organized like 
      a real embassy. It had just been a consulate up to 1948.
MCKINZIE: Did you, then, make any trips back to the United States 
      during your tenure as Ambassador to Ceylon?
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, I came back to sit on a selection board, and I had 
      home leave.
MCKINZIE: Did you talk to President Truman any of these times?
SATTERTHWAITE: No, not in those days; I had before 
      [41]
I went out to Ceylon, but I didn't get to see him again.
MCKINZIE: Do you recall your conversation with him before you went 
      out?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, the old rules in those days was that we in the 
      State Department weren't supposed to keep records of conversations with 
      the President. I may have scratched out a few notes, but I haven't found 
      them if I have. And actually I am in the process of going through those 
      papers now, but not very rapidly. But anyway, it was a very pleasant 
      conversation, and as I mentioned in this letter, he was fascinated with 
      that part of the world -- only he got Adams Peak mixed up with Mount St. 
      Thomas which is the hill outside of Madras. I never told him; I'm not so 
      sure that I knew it myself at the time, but as soon as I got out there I 
      realized the mistake. But I had an extremely pleasant conversation with 
      him -- did I ever see him again? No, but I saw Eisenhower his
[42]
successor several times.
MCKINZIE: President Truman may have had a slightly different way of 
      using the State Department from, perhaps, President Eisenhower. I'm not 
      sure.
SATTERTHWAITE: But actually, he had Secretaries of State whom he had 
      confidence in, and I was lucky to be in the Department when he was 
      President because the White House wasn't running foreign affairs except 
      through the Secretary of State; with both General Marshall and Dean 
      Acheson. 
MCKINZIE: So you felt that the talent that the State Department had was 
      being used?
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes. I had also however a very short time with James 
      Byrnes as Secretary. Of course General Marshall could see the President 
      anytime, but being a general he never took advantage of this. In fact, on 
      one occasion, I think it was over Palestine actually, he told the 
      President -- I was told by somebody at the meeting -- "Mr.
[43]
President, if you take this action I wouldn't vote for you, but of 
      course I don't vote."
He as an Army officer never voted apparently in his life. I always 
      voted by mail when I could, but I always called myself an Independent, 
      because I felt that I shouldn't be partisan; I still have that 
feeling.
MCKINZIE: Did you feel that you were shielded pretty much from 
      political pressures and pressure groups in the Bureau of Near 
      Eastern Affairs?
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, I never had any pressure from the White House that 
      was objectionable in the least. Obviously pressures were brought by 
      Congress sometimes, but that's something else, that's just par for the 
      course, you can expect that; but certainly not from the White House under 
      either Truman or Eisenhower. I think this is true of Kennedy, too -- he 
      was President and then Johnson -- during my four and a half years in South 
      Africa.
[44]
I don't know why, but maybe it's because of the job I had. It wasn't 
      that they wouldn't send political people to see me, but I certainly never 
      felt under any pressure to take any action I thought was wrong. If they 
      made a decision I accepted it, of course, because a career man either does 
      or resigns if it's anything of vital interest, and it never was.
MCKINZIE: Where do you think, as you look back now, President Truman 
      will rate as a President?
SATTERTHWAITE: Well, I was astonished to see the other day in some poll 
      that he didn't have a high rating, because I think those of us that worked 
      with him would rate him very high, maybe not in the very top category, but 
      certainly as an outstanding President. He made decisions, and usually the 
      right ones we felt, and was a man of courage. While he didn't have any 
      great background in foreign affairs except that fortunately he did have 
      the
[45]
Truman committee on lend-lease, and he had had that exposure as a 
      Senator, when he suddenly became Vice President. But, in any event, he did 
      have an interest in foreign affairs in that experience. His first great 
      mistake was one he realized, when he accepted the advice of politicians 
      rather than foreign service experts on lend-lease and, as I recall, he 
      admits it in his memoirs, doesn't he? And he didn't let that happen 
      again.
Palestine was something apart, you'd have to accept the fact that this 
      was -- I think he felt strongly himself. He stuck by Eddie Jacobson, who 
      was his great and good friend. Certainly as one or two of our boys in the 
      United Nations said, he was right there on the job. And lots of funny 
      things happened. One day during a United Nations session the President 
      couldn't get, first, General Marshall, and then he couldn't get Herschel 
      Johnson, both of the United Nations, so he got someone else who carried 
      out his instructions
[46]
with a great enthusiasm. Either of the others would have persuaded him 
      to modify them a little at a crucial time in the U.N. Security Council 
      debate. This is just luck, you see.
MCKINZIE: Getting ahold of the right man.
SATTERTHWAITE: Yes, instead of getting the man that he got 
      unfortunately when he couldn't get either Marshall or Johnson.
