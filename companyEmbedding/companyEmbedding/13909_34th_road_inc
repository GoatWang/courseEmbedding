City - Flushing








Flushing






The Flushing neighborhood in Long Island is a diverse residential community in the northern part of Queens, N.Y.  This bustling neighborhood includes a large Asian presence as well as Hispanic, European, Middle Eastern and African American residents.  Flushing features lush gardens, world-class sports venues, museums and performance arts spaces.

Flushing sits slightly more than 15 miles east of New York City and enjoys an easy commute to the city thanks to the IRT Flushing Line and its five railroad stations.  Lots of shops and commercial buildings occupy the northern part of Main Street, making this business district the fourth largest in NYC.  Residents in the mood for authentic Asian cuisine or looking for a rare Japanese comic book find the Flushing neighborhood provides all they need.

About the Neighborhood: Flushing

              Flushing is one of the largest, most populated, and best-known neighborhoods in Queens.
              
It is also the densest eastern Queens neighborhood, and combined with East Flushing the last big stop before suburbia. Flushing borders College Point to the northwest, Murray Hill to the east, and Queensboro Hill to the south.
