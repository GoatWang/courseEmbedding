Early life and education[edit]
Thompson is the son of a railroad laborer from Hannibal, Missouri. He received his bachelor's degree, cum laude, from Culver-Stockton College in 1967, his master's degree from Michigan State University in 1969, and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Michigan in 1974.
In 1970, Thompson married Brenda Anne Taggart. They have two sons.
Corporate career[edit]
Thompson worked as an industrial relations representative for Ford Motor Company during law school. After graduation he worked at an attorney for Monsanto Company in St. Louis until 1977. That year he joined the law firm of King & Spalding in Atlanta, Georgia. He left the firm in 1982 for four years as U.S. attorney for the northern District of Georgia; however, he returned and was made a partner in 1986. He left King & Spalding in 2001 to return to the Justice Department as Deputy Attorney General.
Thompson was a director of the Providian Financial Corporation, during the time when Providian paid over $400 million to settle charges of consumer and securities fraud. Thompson made $4.7 million in the sale of Providian stock prior to the allegations. In 2002, Judicial Watch filed suit against Thompson for allegedly artificially inflating the stock price in order to illegally increase his earnings in the sale of stock. Thompson has denied any wrongdoing.
Department of Justice[edit]
From 1982 to 1986, he served as U.S. attorney for the northern District of Georgia, and led the Southeastern Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. The New York Times describes him as "a moderate" who is "respected by both Democrats and Republicans."
Independent Counsel[edit]
Thompson served as Independent Counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development Investigation from 1995[1] to 1998, completing the investigation and prosecution started by Judge Arlin M. Adams in 1990.[2]
Deputy U.S. Attorney General[edit]
In 2001, Thompson was appointed as Deputy U.S. Attorney General by President Bush.
Maher Arar[edit]
Thompson was responsible for signing a deportation memo that sent Canadian citizen Maher Arar to Syria where he was tortured. Thompson signed that memo despite an immigration panel's decision that Arar would be tortured there, a clear breach of international laws prohibiting torture. The Canadian government has since apologized for its conduct in the matter and paid millions to Arar. Arar's attempts to get justice in the U.S. have been opposed on 'state secrets' grounds by both the Bush and Obama administrations, and was recently dismissed on those grounds by the 2nd Circuit Appeals Court.
Thompson Memorandum[edit]
In January 2003 Thompson issued an internal Justice Department document informally titled the Thompson Memorandum[3] written to help federal prosecutors decide whether to charge a corporation, rather than or in addition to individuals within the corporation, with criminal offenses.[4] The guidelines were considered tough because they require that to claim cooperation, companies must (1) turn over materials from internal investigations, (2) waive attorney-client privilege, and (3) not provide targeted executive with company-paid lawyers.[4] The guidelines were criticized for, among other things, "seriously eroding" attorney-client privilege.[5] These guidelines were "eased" in December 2006 by Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty who issued a revised version of the memorandum.[6]
Career after the Department of Justice[edit]
In August 2003 Thompson left the Justice Department and was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution for a year before accepting the position of senior vice-president for government affairs and general counsel at Pepsico in Purchase, New York.[7] Since 2011, he has served as the John A. Sibley Professor in Corporate and Business Law at the University of Georgia School of Law, where he teaches corporate responsibility and white collar criminal law, and serves on the Dean Rusk International Law Center Council.[8] Thompson has also taught at Georgia State University College of Law.[9]
Thompson was named in the press as a leading candidate for Attorney General after John Ashcroft resigned on November 9, 2004. Thompson, if selected, would have been the first African-American ever to head the Justice Department. Instead, Alberto Gonzales was selected as Ashcroft's replacement. Later, Thompson's name was mentioned as a possible candidate to replace Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. With the resignation of Gonzales in August 2007, Thompson's name again surfaced a candidate for Attorney General. He supported former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 2008 presidential election,[10] and the American Bar Association mentioned Thompson again as a possible Attorney General or Supreme Court justice during a potential John McCain administration.[11][12]

Early life and education[edit]
Thompson is the son of a railroad laborer from Hannibal, Missouri. He received his bachelor's degree, cum laude, from Culver-Stockton College in 1967, his master's degree from Michigan State University in 1969, and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Michigan in 1974.
In 1970, Thompson married Brenda Anne Taggart. They have two sons.
Corporate career[edit]
Thompson worked as an industrial relations representative for Ford Motor Company during law school. After graduation he worked at an attorney for Monsanto Company in St. Louis until 1977. That year he joined the law firm of King & Spalding in Atlanta, Georgia. He left the firm in 1982 for four years as U.S. attorney for the northern District of Georgia; however, he returned and was made a partner in 1986. He left King & Spalding in 2001 to return to the Justice Department as Deputy Attorney General.
Thompson was a director of the Providian Financial Corporation, during the time when Providian paid over $400 million to settle charges of consumer and securities fraud. Thompson made $4.7 million in the sale of Providian stock prior to the allegations. In 2002, Judicial Watch filed suit against Thompson for allegedly artificially inflating the stock price in order to illegally increase his earnings in the sale of stock. Thompson has denied any wrongdoing.
Department of Justice[edit]
From 1982 to 1986, he served as U.S. attorney for the northern District of Georgia, and led the Southeastern Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. The New York Times describes him as "a moderate" who is "respected by both Democrats and Republicans."
Independent Counsel[edit]
Thompson served as Independent Counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development Investigation from 1995[1] to 1998, completing the investigation and prosecution started by Judge Arlin M. Adams in 1990.[2]
Deputy U.S. Attorney General[edit]
In 2001, Thompson was appointed as Deputy U.S. Attorney General by President Bush.
Maher Arar[edit]
Thompson was responsible for signing a deportation memo that sent Canadian citizen Maher Arar to Syria where he was tortured. Thompson signed that memo despite an immigration panel's decision that Arar would be tortured there, a clear breach of international laws prohibiting torture. The Canadian government has since apologized for its conduct in the matter and paid millions to Arar. Arar's attempts to get justice in the U.S. have been opposed on 'state secrets' grounds by both the Bush and Obama administrations, and was recently dismissed on those grounds by the 2nd Circuit Appeals Court.
Thompson Memorandum[edit]
In January 2003 Thompson issued an internal Justice Department document informally titled the Thompson Memorandum[3] written to help federal prosecutors decide whether to charge a corporation, rather than or in addition to individuals within the corporation, with criminal offenses.[4] The guidelines were considered tough because they require that to claim cooperation, companies must (1) turn over materials from internal investigations, (2) waive attorney-client privilege, and (3) not provide targeted executive with company-paid lawyers.[4] The guidelines were criticized for, among other things, "seriously eroding" attorney-client privilege.[5] These guidelines were "eased" in December 2006 by Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty who issued a revised version of the memorandum.[6]
Career after the Department of Justice[edit]
In August 2003 Thompson left the Justice Department and was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution for a year before accepting the position of senior vice-president for government affairs and general counsel at Pepsico in Purchase, New York.[7] Since 2011, he has served as the John A. Sibley Professor in Corporate and Business Law at the University of Georgia School of Law, where he teaches corporate responsibility and white collar criminal law, and serves on the Dean Rusk International Law Center Council.[8] Thompson has also taught at Georgia State University College of Law.[9]
Thompson was named in the press as a leading candidate for Attorney General after John Ashcroft resigned on November 9, 2004. Thompson, if selected, would have been the first African-American ever to head the Justice Department. Instead, Alberto Gonzales was selected as Ashcroft's replacement. Later, Thompson's name was mentioned as a possible candidate to replace Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. With the resignation of Gonzales in August 2007, Thompson's name again surfaced a candidate for Attorney General. He supported former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 2008 presidential election,[10] and the American Bar Association mentioned Thompson again as a possible Attorney General or Supreme Court justice during a potential John McCain administration.[11][12]

ATLANTA, Oct. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern Company today announced the election of Larry D. Thompson to its board of directors, effective Dec. 1, 2014. Thompson is the executive vice president of government affairs, general counsel and corporate secretary of PepsiCo, Inc. until his retirement, effective at the end of the year. He previously served on the Southern Company board of directors from 2010 to 2012. 
"Larry is a dynamic addition to Southern Company's board of directors and we are glad to welcome him back," said Southern Company Chairman, President and CEO Thomas A. Fanning. "His leadership in the public and private sectors has served us well, and we will once again benefit from his experienced counsel."
Thompson assumed his current position with PepsiCo, Inc. in July 2012, with responsibility for the company's worldwide legal function and government affairs and public policy organizations. He also oversees the company's global compliance function and the PepsiCo, Inc. Foundation. From 2004 to 2011, Thompson served as PepsiCo, Inc.'s senior vice president of government affairs, general counsel and secretary. 
Earlier in his career, Thompson was a senior fellow with The Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C. He has served in the U.S. Department of Justice as deputy attorney general and led the department's National Security Coordination Council. In 2002, President George W. Bush named Thompson to head the Corporate Fraud Task Force, where he led the Justice Department's investigation into Enron.
Before initially joining PepsiCo, Inc. in 2004, Thompson had a broad-ranging legal career, including serving as a litigator at the Atlanta, Georgia law firm of King & Spalding LLP – where he was named partner in 1986; chairing the Judicial Review Commission on Foreign Asset Control; being named an independent counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development; serving as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia; and acting as a member of the attorney general's Economic Crime Council.

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Thompson, Larry D carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Thompson, Larry D currently holds license 6201028653 (Professional Engineer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Thompson, Larry D



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
