				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

Get to Know First IB View All FAQs

Q

How quickly can you close my mortgage? 

First IB can typically close the majority of home purchase mortgages and refinance transactions in 40 days or less. Our experienced loan team will work with you to identify the documents we will need to meet your closing date.
The time to close may vary depending on property and borrower circumstances. Be sure to speak with one of our experienced loan officers about your specific situation.




Q

What Commercial Banking services does First IB provide? 

First IB Commercial Banking offers new and refinanced working capital lines of credit, equipment loans, acquisition/expansion loans, owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, SBA loans and commercial credit cards. Our experienced Commercial Relationship Bankers can offer flexible loan structures that are tailored to your company’s needs. Our treasury management product suite includes commercial online banking, ACH and wire origination, sweep and zero balance accounts, remote deposit capture and commercial mobile banking. First IB offers real-time processing of all transactions which means no delays on inter-account transfers and debit and credit transactions.




Q

Can I apply for a mortgage loan before I find a home to purchase? 

Yes, applying for a mortgage loan before you find a home may be the best thing you could do! If you apply now you could pre-qualify online in minutes. Or, take it a step further, and we will review requested documentation in order to issue an official pre-approval. You can use the pre-approval letter to assure real estate brokers and sellers that you are a qualified buyer. A mortgage pre-approval helps give more weight to any offer that you make.




Q

How do I make deposits to my personal account? 

In today’s wireless world, you no longer have to make deposits in person. First IB offers multiple ways to deposit your funds. Learn more in this brief video.




Q

Can I really bank without branches? 

Yes! First Internet Bank is a pioneer in the “direct banking” model. We’ve been around since 1999, and our thousands of customers across the country have discovered the benefits of banking without branches. Chances are, with direct deposit and ATMs, you probably don’t visit bank branches that often anyway… so why pay for something you don’t use? Without a costly branch network, we pass our savings on to you in the form of great rates and low fees. We’ve loaded up our online banking site with tools and resources to help you manage your money more easily and make smart financial choices for your future. When you have a question, an experienced Relationship Banker is here to help – by phone, email or online chat.

Q

How quickly can you close my mortgage? 

First IB can typically close the majority of home purchase mortgages and refinance transactions in 40 days or less. Our experienced loan team will work with you to identify the documents we will need to meet your closing date.
The time to close may vary depending on property and borrower circumstances. Be sure to speak with one of our experienced loan officers about your specific situation.




Q

What Commercial Banking services does First IB provide? 

First IB Commercial Banking offers new and refinanced working capital lines of credit, equipment loans, acquisition/expansion loans, owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, SBA loans and commercial credit cards. Our experienced Commercial Relationship Bankers can offer flexible loan structures that are tailored to your company’s needs. Our treasury management product suite includes commercial online banking, ACH and wire origination, sweep and zero balance accounts, remote deposit capture and commercial mobile banking. First IB offers real-time processing of all transactions which means no delays on inter-account transfers and debit and credit transactions.




Q

Can I apply for a mortgage loan before I find a home to purchase? 

Yes, applying for a mortgage loan before you find a home may be the best thing you could do! If you apply now you could pre-qualify online in minutes. Or, take it a step further, and we will review requested documentation in order to issue an official pre-approval. You can use the pre-approval letter to assure real estate brokers and sellers that you are a qualified buyer. A mortgage pre-approval helps give more weight to any offer that you make.




Q

How do I make deposits to my personal account? 

In today’s wireless world, you no longer have to make deposits in person. First IB offers multiple ways to deposit your funds. Learn more in this brief video.




Q

Can I really bank without branches? 

Yes! First Internet Bank is a pioneer in the “direct banking” model. We’ve been around since 1999, and our thousands of customers across the country have discovered the benefits of banking without branches. Chances are, with direct deposit and ATMs, you probably don’t visit bank branches that often anyway… so why pay for something you don’t use? Without a costly branch network, we pass our savings on to you in the form of great rates and low fees. We’ve loaded up our online banking site with tools and resources to help you manage your money more easily and make smart financial choices for your future. When you have a question, an experienced Relationship Banker is here to help – by phone, email or online chat.
