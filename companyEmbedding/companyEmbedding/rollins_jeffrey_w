Jeff W Rollins's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Pioneer Internet
Job Details
               Although Pioneer Internet maintains many mail servers, they appear as only one server to the outside world. This is a more efficient (and faster) way of handling your e-mail, but it does have one drawback. If one user contracts a virus and sends thousands of e-mails, this can (and does) place our mail servers on these lists. We proactively monitor the amount of outgoing traffic each pld.com customer sends. If this amount appears excessive, we disallow that user from sending any additional e-mail until we can contact them. This procedure ensures that we know what is leaving our servers and keeps our mail servers off the reputable lists. We understand that the blocking of e-mail is a sensitive issue and can cause considerable concern, both to our customers and the remote ISPâ€™s customer who cannot receive e-mail. Pioneer Internet utilizes the services of Postini, which automatically updates any blacklists every 15 minutes. Thus if a remote site is sending spam, we will block them temporarily, but check again in 15 minutes. Once the threat has stopped, e-mail from the remote ISP is allowed into our system. This practice allows Pioneer Internet customers to receive e-mail from all other ISPâ€™s, while still preventing a large percentage of spam. Only well documented spamming sites are blocked for a longer period of time.
