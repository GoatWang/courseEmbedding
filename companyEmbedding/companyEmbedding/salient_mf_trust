	Class A shares are available with no front-end sales charge on investments of $1 million or more. Brokers that initiate and are responsible for purchases of $1 million or
	more may receive a sales commission of up to 1.00% of the offering price of Class A shares. As a result, Class A shares that were not subject to a front-end sales charge, but for which a commission or finders fee was paid, may be
	subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of 1.00% if such Class A shares are sold within one year of purchase. In addition, while Class C shares are offered at NAV, without any initial sales charge, a 1.00% CDSC may be charged on
	any Class C shares upon which a finders fee has been paid that are sold within one year of purchase.






	 






	(2)






	Other Expenses include the indirect expenses associated with the Funds investment in its subsidiary, Salient Alternative Beta Offshore Fund Ltd. (the
	Alternative Beta Subsidiary).






	 






	(3)






	Under the Expense Limitation Agreement, Salient Advisors, L.P. (Salient Advisors or Advisor) has contractually agreed to waive all or a portion of its
	management fee and reimburse or pay operating expenses of the Fund to the extent necessary to maintain the Funds total operating expenses at 1.55% for Class A, 2.30% for Class C, and 1.30% for Class I shares, excluding certain expenses,
	such as taxes, brokerage and transactional expenses, interest, short dividend expense, any acquired fund fees and expenses, expenses associated with the Funds investments in the Alternative Beta Subsidiary, litigation and extraordinary
	expenses. Management fee waivers are expressed in the table as a percentage of net assets, and are estimated for the Funds first year of operations. The Expense Limitation Agreement expires on July 31, 2016, unless renewed by mutual
	agreement of the Fund and the Advisor based upon a determination doing so would be appropriate under the prevailing circumstances. The Advisor is permitted to recover expenses attributable to the Fund or a Class thereof that the Advisor
	has borne (whether through reduction of its management fee or otherwise) in later periods to the extent that the expenses for a Class of shares fall below the annual rate in effect at the time of the actual waiver/reimbursement. Under the
	Expense Limitation Agreement, the Fund is not obligated to reimburse such expenses beyond three years from the end of such year in which the Advisor waived a fee or reimbursed an expense. Any such recovery by the Advisor will not cause a class to
	exceed the annual limitation rate in effect at the time of the actual waiver/reimbursement.








	Expense Example





	This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. Please see below a hypothetical
	example showing the




	 



	 




	1








	expenses of a $10,000 investment in the Fund for the time periods indicated (Kept column) and then assuming a
	redemption of all of your shares at the end of those periods (Sold column). The example assumes a 5% average annual return. The example assumes Fund expenses will not change over the periods. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based
	on these assumptions, your costs would be:

	Portfolio Turnover





	The Fund
	pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities and investments (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund
	shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance.




	The Funds portfolio turnover for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was 0% of the average value of its portfolio. Under applicable requirements, derivative instruments and instruments with a
	maturity of one year or less at the time of acquisition are excluded from the calculation of the portfolio turnover rate which leads to the 0% portfolio turnover rate shown above. If these instruments were included in the calculation, the Fund would
	have a high portfolio turnover rate.







	Principal Investment Strategies





	The Fund invests both long and short primarily in futures and forward contracts but may also invest in other financial instruments, which may include securities as well as derivatives, in order to gain exposure to
	a variety of non-traditional risk premia identified by the Advisor. Risk premia, plural for a risk premium, are the excess positive expected returns from exposures to or strategies in various asset classes/markets and investment styles (as discussed
	below) above the risk-free rate represented by cash or government bonds. The Fund will also hold a large portion of its assets either directly or indirectly (through the Alternative Beta Subsidiary, as discussed below) in cash, money market
	instruments or other cash equivalents, some of which will serve as margin or collateral for the Funds futures contracts or other derivatives positions.





	Investment Process:

	The Advisors investment process begins with analysis and systematic identification of various factors, which may include by way of example but not limitation market
	inefficiencies, market participant behaviors, supply and demand imbalances, market expectations and cyclical trends that the Advisor believes provide non-traditional risk premia.




	Once identified, the Advisor determines which global markets (such as equity, commodity, currency, interest rate and other markets) are appropriate for each risk premium and






	whether to gain exposure to the risk premium by directly investing in financial instruments using its own systematic strategies, or indirectly by entering into a derivatives transaction with
	a third party.




	The Advisor constructs a portfolio in which it attempts to balance the risk contribution of the risk premia or investment strategies and
	for which it targets a 15% annualized standard deviation of returns (variance). The risk calculation is derived from each strategys standard deviation of returns, its correlation with each of the other strategies within the
	portfolio and the percentage weight of each strategy within the portfolio. The portfolio is rebalanced dynamically according to this framework on at least a monthly basis, although rebalancing may occur more frequently.





	Investment Types:

	The Fund primarily gains exposure to asset classes, such as equities, commodities, currencies and interest rates, by investing in futures,
	swaps and forward contracts, cash, money market instruments or other cash equivalents, some of which will serve as margin or collateral for the Funds futures contracts or other derivatives positions; and by investing in the Alternative Beta
	Subsidiary, a wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary of the Fund, organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands for purposes of certain of the Funds derivatives trading.





	Geographic Limitations:

	The Fund has no geographic limits on where its investments may be located or where its assets may be exposed. This flexibility allows the Fund to take advantage of investments or gain
	exposure to asset classes and markets around the world, which include emerging markets.







	Principal Investment Risks





	An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other
	government agency. The Funds principal risk factors are listed below. The Funds shares will go up and down in price, meaning that you could lose money by investing in the Fund. Many factors influence a mutual funds performance. An
	investment in the Fund is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such. Before investing, be sure to read the additional descriptions of these risks beginning on page 70 of the prospectus.




	As an overall matter, instability in the financial markets has led many governments, including the United States government, to take a number of unprecedented
	actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and, in some cases, a lack of liquidity. Federal, state and other governments, and their regulatory agencies or
	self-regulatory organizations, may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the Fund invests, or the issuers of such instruments, in ways that are unforeseeable. Legislation or regulation may also change the way in which
	the Fund itself is regulated. Such legislation or regulation could limit or preclude the Funds ability to achieve its investment objective.





	Risks of Investment Activities Generally:

	All securities investing and trading activities risk the loss of capital. No assurance can be given that the
	Funds investment activities will




	 



	 




	2








	be successful or that the Funds shareholders will not suffer losses.





	Commodities Risk:

	Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of
	commodity-linked derivative investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or sectors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather,
	embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments.





	Counterparty Risk:

	In general, a derivative contract
	typically involves leverage,

	i.e


	.

	, it provides exposure to potential gain or loss from a change in the level of the market price of a security, currency or commodity (or a basket or index) in a notional amount that exceeds the amount
	of cash or assets required to establish or maintain the derivative contract. Many of these derivative contracts will be privately negotiated in the over-the-counter market. These contracts also involve exposure to credit risk, since contract
	performance depends in part on the financial condition of the counterparty. If a privately negotiated over-the-counter contract calls for payments by the Fund, the Fund must be prepared to make such payments when due. In addition, if a
	counterpartys creditworthiness declines, the Fund may not receive payments owed under the contract, or such payments may be delayed under such circumstances and the value of agreements with such counterparty can be expected to decline,
	potentially resulting in losses by the Fund.





	Currency Risk:

	The risk that changes in currency exchange rates will negatively affect securities
	denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies. The liquidity and trading value of foreign currencies could be affected by global economic factors, such as inflation, interest rate levels, and trade balances among countries, as
	well as the actions of sovereign governments. Adverse changes in currency exchange rates (relative to the U.S. dollar) may erode or reverse any potential gains from the Funds investments in securities denominated in a foreign currency or may
	widen existing losses. The Funds net currency positions may expose it to risks independent of its securities positions.





	Debt Securities
	Risk:

	Fixed-income securities generally are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and/or repay the principal on its debt.
	Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. When the general level of interest rates goes up, the prices of most fixed-income securities go down.
	When the general level of interest rates goes down, the prices of most fixed-income securities go up.



	 





	 





	







	 






	Credit Risk.

	Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the security will not be able to make principal and interest payments when due.
	Changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Funds investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition
	of the issuer and the terms of the obligation. Securities rated by the rating agencies in











	 





	the four highest categories (Standard & Poors (S&P) (AAA, AA, A and BBB), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) (AAA, AA, A and BBB) or Moodys Investors Service,
	Inc. (Moodys) (Aaa, Aa, A and Baa)) are considered investment grade, but they may also have some speculative characteristics, meaning that they carry more risk than higher rated securities and may have problems making principal and
	interest payments in difficult economic climates. Investment grade ratings do not guarantee that bonds will not lose value.






	 





	 





	







	 






	Extension Risk.

	Extension risk is the risk that, when interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the issuer (or obligor) more slowly
	than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall. Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of longer-term securities generally changes more in
	response to changes in interest rates than shorter-term securities. As a result, in a period of rising interest rates, securities may exhibit additional volatility and may lose value.






	 





	 





	







	 






	Interest Rate Risk.

	The yields for certain securities are susceptible in the short-term to fluctuations in interest rates, and the prices of such
	securities may decline when interest rates rise. Interest rate risk in general is the risk that prices of fixed income securities generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates increase. The Fund may decline in value
	or suffer losses if short term or long term interest rates rise sharply or otherwise change in a manner not anticipated by the Advisor.






	 





	 





	







	 






	Prepayment Risk.

	Prepayment risk is the risk that certain debt securities with high interest rates will be prepaid by the issuer before they mature. When
	interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and an investor may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields. In periods of falling interest rates, the rate of
	prepayments tends to increase (as does price fluctuation) as borrowers are motivated to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates. During such periods, reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds by the management team will generally be at lower
	rates of return than the return on the assets that were prepaid. Prepayment reduces the yield to maturity and the average life of the security.








	Derivatives Risk:

	The use of derivative instruments exposes the Fund to additional risks and transaction costs. These instruments come in many varieties and have a wide range of potential risks and rewards,
	and may include futures contracts, options on futures contracts, options (both written and purchased), swaps, swaptions, and forward currency exchange contracts. A risk of the Funds use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
	may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets.





	Emerging Market Risk:

	The Fund intends to have exposure to emerging markets.
	Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to




	 



	 




	3








	experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition,
	many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.





	Equity Securities Risk:

	Equity
	securities may be subject to general movements in the stock market, and a significant drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may have exposure to or invest in equity securities of
	companies with small or medium capitalization. Investments in securities of companies with small or medium capitalization involve certain risks that may differ from, or be greater than, those for larger companies, such as higher volatility, lower
	trading volume, lack of liquidity, fewer business lines and lack of public information (See Small and Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk).





	Foreign Securities Risk:

	Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will
	lose money. These risks include:



	 





	 




	




	The Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and
	may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.





	 





	 




	




	Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Funds portfolio.





	 





	 




	




	The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product,
	reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.





	 





	 




	




	The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.





	 





	 




	




	Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to
	protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.





	 





	 




	




	Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and
	clearance of U.S. investments.







	Forward and Futures Contract Risk:

	The successful use of forward and futures contracts draws upon
	the Advisors skill and experience with respect to such instruments and is subject to special risk considerations. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are (a) the imperfect correlation between the change in
	market value of the instruments held by the Fund and the price of the forward or futures contract; (b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a forward or futures contract and the resulting inability to close a forward or futures
	contract when desired; (c) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d) the Advisors inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices, interest rates,






	currency exchange rates and other economic factors; (e) the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations; and (f) if the Fund has insufficient
	cash, it may have to sell securities from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements, and the Fund may have to sell securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.





	High Portfolio Turnover Risk:

	The risk that when investing on a shorter-term basis, the Fund may as a result trade more frequently and incur higher levels of brokerage fees and commissions.





	Investment in Money Market Mutual Funds Risk:

	The Fund invests in money market mutual funds. An investment in a money market mutual fund is not insured or
	guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Although such funds seek to preserve the value of the funds investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund.





	Leverage Risk:

	As part of the Funds principal investment strategy, the Fund makes investments in futures contracts, forward currency contracts and
	other derivative instruments. The futures contracts and certain other derivatives provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure, as well as the potential for greater loss. If the Fund uses leverage
	through activities such as borrowing, entering into short sales, purchasing securities on margin or on a when-issued basis or purchasing derivative instruments in an effort to increase its returns, the Fund has the risk of magnified
	losses that occur when losses affect an asset base, enlarged by borrowings or the creation of liabilities, that exceeds the net assets of the Fund. The net asset value of the Fund employing leverage will be more volatile and sensitive to market
	movements. Leverage may involve the creation of a liability that requires the Fund to pay interest.





	Liquidity Risk:

	Certain securities may trade
	less frequently than those of larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations. In the event certain securities experience limited trading volumes, the prices may display abrupt or erratic movements at times. Additionally, it may be more
	difficult for the Fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices. As a result, these securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Advisor
	believes it is desirable to do so. The Funds investment in securities that are less actively traded or over time experience decreased trading volume may restrict its ability to take advantage of other market opportunities or to dispose of
	securities. This also may affect adversely the Funds ability to make dividend distributions. The Fund will not purchase or otherwise acquire any security if, as a result, more than 15% of its net assets would be invested in illiquid
	investments.





	Manager Risk:

	If the Funds portfolio managers make poor investment decisions, it will negatively affect the Funds
	investment performance.





	Market Events Risk:

	The U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve, as well as certain foreign governments and their central
	banks, have taken various steps designed to support and stabilize credit and financial markets since 2008. Reduction or withdrawal




	 



	 




	4








	of this support, failure of efforts to stabilize the markets, or investor perception that such efforts are not
	succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally, as well as have an adverse impact on the liquidity and value of certain securities. In addition, policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries are affecting
	many aspects of financial regulation. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted in the U.S., reflecting a significant revision of the U.S. financial regulatory framework.
	The Dodd-Frank Act addresses a variety of topics, including, among others, new rules for trading in derivatives; restrictions on banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading of certain instruments; the registration and additional regulation
	of private fund managers; and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans. Fund investments may be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act and any related or additional legislation or regulation in unforeseeable ways. The ultimate effect of the
	Dodd-Frank Act and any related or additional regulation is not yet known. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time.





	Market Risk:

	Market risk is the risk that the markets on which the Funds investments trade will increase or decrease in value. Prices may fluctuate
	widely over short or extended periods in response to company, market or economic news. Markets also tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising and falling prices. If there is a general decline in the securities and other markets, your investment
	in the Fund may lose value, regardless of the individual results of the securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests.





	Model and Data
	Risk:

	Given the complexity of the investments and strategies of the Fund, the Advisor relies heavily on quantitative models (both proprietary models developed by the Advisor, and those supplied by third party vendors) and information and data
	supplied by third party vendors (Models and Data). Models and Data are used to construct sets of transactions and investments and to provide risk management insights.




	When Models and Data prove to be incorrect or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose the Fund to potential risks. The success of relying on such models may depend on the accuracy and reliability
	of historical data supplied by third party vendors.




	All models rely on correct market data inputs. If incorrect market data is entered into even a
	well-founded model, the resulting information will be incorrect. However, even if market data is input correctly, model prices will often differ substantially from market prices, especially for securities with complex characteristics,
	such as derivative securities.





	Momentum Style Risk:

	Investing in momentum entails establishing long positions in securities that have had
	positive recent returns, and short positions in securities that have had negative recent returns. These securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities. In addition, there may be periods when the momentum style is out of
	favor, and during which the investment performance of a fund using a momentum strategy may suffer.







	Non-Diversified Status Risk:

	The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of
	a smaller number of issuers, the Fund may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely, which may, therefore, have a greater impact on the Funds performance.





	Short Sale Risk:

	The Fund may take a short position in a derivative instrument, such as a future, forward or swap. A short position on a
	derivative instrument involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the value of the underlying instrument. The Fund may also from time to time sell securities short, which involves borrowing and selling a security and covering such
	borrowed security through a later purchase. A short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss, in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the
	short position. There can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase. The Fund must set aside cover for short sales to comply with applicable SEC provisions under the Investment
	Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act).





	Small and Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk:

	The Fund may invest its assets in the
	common stocks and other equity securities of small and mid-capitalization companies with smaller market capitalizations. While the Advisor believes these investments may provide significant potential for appreciation, they involve higher risks in
	some respects than do investments in common stocks and other equity securities of larger companies. For example, prices of such investments are often more volatile than prices of large-capitalization stocks and other equity securities. In addition,
	due to thin trading in some such investments, an investment in these common stocks and other equity securities may be more illiquid than that of common stocks or other equity securities of larger market capitalization issuers (See Liquidity
	Risk). Smaller capitalization companies also fail more often than larger companies and may have more limited management and financial resources than larger companies.





	Sovereign Debt Risk:

	These investments are subject to the risk that a governmental entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on its sovereign debt, due, for example, to cash flow
	problems, insufficient foreign currency reserves, political considerations, the relative size of the governmental entitys debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place economic reforms required by the International
	Monetary Fund or other multilateral agencies. If a governmental entity defaults, it may ask for more time in which to pay or for further loans. There is no legal process for collecting sovereign debt that a government does not pay nor are there
	bankruptcy proceedings through which all or part of the sovereign debt that a governmental entity has not repaid may be collected.





	Subsidiary
	Risk:

	By investing in the Alternative Beta Subsidiary, the Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Alternative Beta Subsidiarys investments. The commodity-related instruments held by the Alternative Beta Subsidiary are
	generally similar to those that are permitted to be held by the Fund and are subject to the same risks that apply to similar investments if held directly by the Fund (see Commodities Risk




	 



	 




	5








	above). There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Alternative Beta Subsidiary will be achieved.
	The Alternative Beta Subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 Act, and, unless otherwise noted in this prospectus, is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. However, the Fund wholly owns and controls the Alternative Beta
	Subsidiary, and the Fund and the Alternative Beta Subsidiary are both managed by the Advisor, making it unlikely that the Alternative Beta Subsidiary will take action contrary to the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The Board has
	oversight responsibility for the investment activities of the Fund, including its investment in the Alternative Beta Subsidiary, and the Funds role as sole shareholder of the Alternative Beta Subsidiary. To the extent applicable to the
	investment activities of the Alternative Beta Subsidiary, the Alternative Beta Subsidiary will be subject to the same investment restrictions and limitations, and follow the same compliance policies and procedures, as the Fund. Changes in the laws
	of the United States and/or the Cayman Islands could result in the inability of the Fund and/or the Alternative Beta Subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and the SAI and could adversely affect the Fund, including resulting in its
	orderly winding-up.





	Swap Agreements Risk:

	Swap agreements involve the risk that the party with whom a fund has entered into the swap will default
	on its obligation to pay the fund and the risk that the fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.





	Tax
	Risk:

	In order for the Fund to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the Fund must derive at least 90 percent of its gross income each taxable year
	from qualifying income, which is described in more detail in the SAI. Income from certain commodity-linked derivative instruments in which the Fund invests is not considered qualifying income. The Fund will therefore attempt to restrict its income
	from commodity-linked derivative instruments that do not generate qualifying income to a maximum of 10 percent of its gross income.




	The Funds
	investment in the Alternative Beta Subsidiary is expected to provide the Fund with exposure to the commodities markets within the limitations of the federal tax requirements of Subchapter M. The annual net profit, if any, realized by the Alternative
	Beta Subsidiary and imputed for income tax purposes to the Fund should constitute qualifying income for purposes of the Fund remaining qualified as a regulated investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.





	Tax Law Change Risk:

	Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued published guidance that qualifying income for a regulated investment
	company does not include income derived directly from certain commodity-linked derivative instruments, the IRS has indicated in a series of private letter rulings that income derived from a wholly-owned offshore subsidiary such as the Alternative
	Beta Subsidiary that invests in such commodity-linked derivative instruments does constitute qualifying income. The Fund has not applied for such a private letter ruling, but relies upon an opinion of counsel based on customary representations that
	income derived from the Alternative Beta






	Subsidiary should be treated as qualifying income. In July 2011, the IRS suspended further issuance of these private letter rulings, indicating that it was reconsidering the underlying policies.
	The IRS subsequently indicated informally that it intends to issue public guidance regarding the use of offshore subsidiaries by regulated investment companies to invest indirectly in commodities and that such guidance will be prospective in
	application and provide for transition periods for affected funds. It is also possible that legislation on this issue could be introduced. If the IRS does issue public guidance, or if legislation is enacted, that results in an adverse determination
	relating to the treatment of income derived by the Fund from the Alternative Beta Subsidiary, the Fund would likely need to significantly change its investment strategy, which could adversely affect the Fund. It is possible that the Fund may be
	unable to qualify as a regulated investment company for one or more years, meaning that all of its income and gains could be taxed first at the Fund level and again when paid out to shareholders.





	Underlying Funds Risk:

	Because the Fund may be an Underlying Fund for one or more related fund of funds and, therefore, a significant
	percentage of the Funds outstanding shares may be held by a fund of funds, a change in asset allocation by the fund of funds could result in purchases and redemptions of a large number of shares of the Fund, causing significant changes to the
	Funds portfolio composition, potential increases in expenses to the Fund and purchases and sales of securities in a short timeframe, each of which could negatively impact Fund performance.





	Volatility Risk:

	The Fund may have investments that appreciate or decrease significantly in value over short periods of time. This may cause the Funds
	net asset value per share to experience significant appreciations or decreases in value over short periods of time.





	U.S. Government Securities
	Risk:

	Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not
	backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so. Certain of the government agency
	securities the Fund may purchase are backed only by the credit of the government agency and not by full faith and credit of the United States.







	Performance Information





	The bar chart and table below
	provide an indication of the risks of an investment in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the Funds performance has varied from year to year. The table shows how the Funds average annual returns (before and after taxes) for




	1 year and since the inception of the Fund compare with those of the HFRI Macro (Total) Index, the benchmark index selected for the Fund. If the Advisor had not
	agreed to waive or reimburse certain Fund expenses during this period, the Funds returns would have been less than those shown. Past performance, including
	before-

                            MLPs and Energy                        


The Houston-based MLP Team is led by seasoned MLP portfolio managers Greg Reid and Ted Gardner, and director of research Parag Sanghani. Houston is the home for many MLPs. In fact, corporate headquarters for 65% of the total market capitalization of the midstream MLP universe is within minutes of our offices. Salient’s MLP strategies are designed to provide the opportunity to potentially capture attractive total returns driven by a combination of distribution yield plus prospective distribution growth. MLP returns have historically had a low correlation to the S&P 500, REITs, high yield, and bonds.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
