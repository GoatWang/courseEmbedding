Envirolastech, Inc. Launches Crowdfunder Campaign to Begin Production of its Green Building Material Made from Recycled Waste



Share Article


















Minnesota-based materials science research, development and manufacturing company is ready to open its first processing facility to transform recycled materials into its advanced composite material used in manufacturing green building products.







Recycled Plastic Composite Material for Green Building

Envirolastech's recycled composite material can be used to manufacture more than 30 different green products for building and landscaping


Past News ReleasesRSS



Rochester, MN (PRWEB)
April 15, 2014
 Envirolastech, Inc. announced the launch of its 60-day Crowdfunder campaign, with a crowdfunding goal of $2.5 million. The minimum investment is $10,000. Envirolastech creates multiple revenue streams and generates profits by producing superior performing green plastic pellets and green plastic building products from recycled waste. Envirolastech recycles and re-uses industrial and post-consumer waste in a proprietary process to produce a recycled plastic composite compound. The composite material in pellet form is used in manufacturing green products for a variety of construction and landscaping applications. The company will use the funds from its campaign to open its first processing and production facility to meet demand for its green material. 
Envirolastech has developed an advanced thermoplastic technology that takes recycled plastics and glass, diverted from landfills, and fly ash from municipal solid waste incinerators and turns the materials into an innovative recycled plastic compound. The company is ready to begin full-scale production to meet demand for its compound for manufacturing a range of green building products, including decking, siding and energy-efficient replacement windows.
“We have proven that our recycled composite material can be used to manufacture more than 30 different green products for use in commercial and residential building and landscaping,” said Paul Schmitt, founder and chief executive officer, Envirolastech, Inc. “We have customers, established manufacturers, ready to use our material to strengthen and improve their green building and landscape products as soon as we get into production.”
“Envirolastech has the potential to keep millions of pounds of plastics and glass out of the waste stream and to utilize tons of fly ash waste material,” said Tim Pickett, president and chief operating officer, Envirolastech, Inc. “The full-scale plant we are seeking funding to construct will be a zero-waste, closed loop facility.”
Envirolastech has devoted 19 years of R&D to develop and refine its proprietary technology. The company has completed extensive laboratory and field testing. The American Society for Testing and Materials has validated the technology. In 2012, Envirolastech won the Clean Tech Division in the 2012 Minnesota Cup competition, which honors top entrepreneurial, innovative businesses. The Polymer Solutions Independent Testing Lab has also recognized the company’s scientific breakthrough with a Top 25 World Plastic Innovation Award.  
Products manufactured with recycled plastic composite compounds are durable, maintenance-free, impervious to water (so they do not crack during freeze-thaw cycles), and are 100 percent recyclable. Envirolastech provides decided advantages over other recycled plastic composites. 
First, the company has developed more than 750 unique formulas with different combinations of recycled plastics. This enables Envirolastech to produce composite plastic pellets specifically formulated with structural and performance characteristics matched to its customers’ exact requirements. Second, Envirolastech produces the only recycled plastic composite that becomes stronger, rather than more brittle, in cold temperatures. Third, Envirolastech’s composite has been tested and proven to have the strength required to replace wood lumber in load-bearing applications.
Envirolastech serves fast-growing markets: green building, sustainable development and landscaping. According to Navigant Research, the global market for green construction materials will grow from $116 billion in 2013 to greater than $254 billion in 2020. Research firm McGraw-Hill Construction reports that builders worldwide are shifting their construction methods toward green building and sustainable construction, with 51 percent of respondents to their survey indicating they expect more than 60 percent of their work to be green by 2015, as compared to 28 percent in 2013 and 13 percent in 2008. The Freedonia Group, Inc. projects that the U.S. market for landscaping products will grow 6.9 percent annually through 2017 to $6.5 billion. 
Details on the Envirolastech Crowdfunder campaign are available at http://www.crowdfunder.com/envirolastech-inc-.

          Walt Maclay          CEO, Voler Systems









          I joined the team because of eyeCam’s comprehensive solution, numerous product offerings and experienced team.
        

          James Huie          Attorney, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati









          The reason we joined the project is because Studio Red likes advanced technology plays and we believe that eyeHand may lead to some really good applications.

        

          Philip Bourgeois          CEO, Studio Red









          I am excited about working with eyeCam because they are delving into futuristic technology that has only been seen in movies and video games. When I put on the eyeHand wrist mounted prototype and the image was projected onto my hand it made me believe that that the technology could work.        

          Tai Geng          Industrial Design, Studio Red 









          ”The wearables and IoT markets include consumer, sports, fitness, medical, enterprise, finance, transportation, security and other industry verticals.  eyeCam’s wearable 3D imaging, interfacing, display, operating, networking and biometric identification systems have unlimited applications, and the opportunity to generate significant revenue.”

Company Overview

Hang w/ has solved the dilemma facing today's pop culture influencersHow to stay relevant with fresh, new, authentic content - and also get paid for their craft, their art, their influence and their time?Hang w/ is live-streaming video from one to many, creating authentic, human and engaging social media relationships - with a monetization layer built in. Hang w/ attracts influencers who use the platform to connect with their fan bases. Many of the fans themselves become broadcasters and develop followings of their own. Broadcasts can be monetized via an integrated ad platform which runs highly targeted advertising before and after live broadcasts. Broadcasters can earn additional revenue through the sale of Pay-Per-View "Digital Tickets" and by receiving "Digital Tips" - both of which can be converted to cash.The technology has been fine tuned and is scaling successfully. Originally developed in stealth mode, and then through a series of user-feedback-driven enhancements and iterations, the product has evolved to include a large number of unique functions and features customized for today's live broadcaster and viewer.

Testimonials



          I believe we are entering a golden age in technology. Creative minds are harnessing what's possible to take human relationships to the next level. Hang w/ weaves together some of the most powerful technological elements – including mobility, social media and live streaming – into one platform.        

          Jared Leto          Advisor









          Hang w/ fits seamlessly into my overall business strategy. I see ways to use it to promote my headphones, apparel, energy shots, film and TV projects, my boxers, and even my philanthropic endeavors.        

          Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson          Investor/Advisor









          I’ve seen the power of social media and how a simple tweet or Instagram pic can bring awareness to an album. I think Hang w/ takes things to the next level. I believe the entertainment industry will line up behind this application and I intend to be at the head of the line.
