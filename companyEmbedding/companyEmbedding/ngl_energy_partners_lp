Expect The Rebound To Continue For NGL Energy Partners - NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NGL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Expect The Rebound To Continue For NGL Energy PartnersJul. 4.17 | About: NGL Energy (NGL) Logan Duvall Contrarian, REITs, dividend growth investing, oil & gasSowing ProsperitySummaryEven with NGL's recent rally, it still looks like a good time to invest.NGL is well positioned for the future and is likely to be a highly profitable investment.There is potential for 30% gains over a 2-year period.Without an overload of information, I will portray facts and reasons for investing in NGL Energy Partners LP (NGL). The past couple of months have been horrid for investors because of the significant drop in price has occurred, but moving ahead, there are reasons to be optimistic. Business Overview NGL Energy Partners LP purchases propane, butane, and other natural gas liquids from refiners, processing plants, producers, and other parties, and sells the product to retailers, refiners, and other participants in wholesale markets. NGL is a Master Limited Partnership (or MLP) with a diverse group of growing businesses, which pays a quarterly dividend of 39 cents. NGL has 5 business groups - Water Solutions, Retail Propane, Crude Logistics, Liquids, and Refined Products. NGL provides services for the energy industry and generally is paid on a fixed-fee basis. However, in some segments - especially Liquids, Refined Products, and Retail Propane - NGL takes title to products and resells them at a markup. 

 

Source for both charts Summary from latest annual report 2017  Total stockholders' equity: 2.23 billion. Market Cap is 1.8 billion (the last price of the stock was 14.65). NGL Energy Partners LP purchases propane, butane, and other natural gas liquids from refiners, processing plants, producers, and other parties, and sells the product to retailers, refiners, and other participants in wholesale markets. Total stockholders' equity has increased from 1.69 billion in 2016 to 2.23 billion in 2017. NGL has 12.26 million in cash (from latest annual report). In 2017, the company has 2.96 billion in long-term debt, and short-term debt is 30 million. (In 2016, the company had 2.91 billion in long-term debt, and short-term debt was 8 million). The company's revenue increased in 2017 (fiscal year ends in March) to 13.02 billion from 11.74 billion in 2016. Net income in 2017 was 137 million; net loss in 2016 was 386 million. NGL Energy Partners has spent 182 million on dividends in 2017. NGL currently pays $1.56 in distributions per year for a yield of 11.14%; 2018 is certainly going to be better than fiscal 2017. According to analysts, NGL should increase its distribution to at least 44 cents per quarter ($1.76 per year). The 11.14% dividend is covered and the growth projects ensure that the numbers will be moving up in fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 will be better because the fiscal year 2017 did not include the full earnings power of the Grand Mesa and Murphy Oil acquisitions. For FY 2018, NGL expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $500M-$525M, including $130M EBITDA for the Grand Mesa Pipeline; FY 2018 CAPEX is projected at $150M-$200M. 
 

Source NGL Energy Partners LP Preferred NGL Energy Partners LP has just issued a preferred stock. The stock will be 9.00% Class B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units. The Preferred Unit trades as NGL-B and currently trades slightly below par at $24.87. Dividend I expect NGL to go ex-dividend around the first of August with a 0.39 cent dividend; a yield currently at a little over 11%. Opinion about the company Fundamentally, I believe NGL to be a good company, and in the future, we can expect promising growth. The fourth quarter ending March 31, 2017, was extremely weak. An abnormally warm winter led to a decrease in propane sales. The majority of investors expected a dividend increase in 2017, but that now looks unlikely. After the weak fourth quarter and lack of a dividend increase, the unit price declined from the low $20s to a low of $11.50. The last two weeks have seen a steady increase to a close of $14.65 on July 3rd. 

NGL data by YCharts Taxes NGL issues a K-1, which many investors despise. Such securities are usually recommended to be held in a taxable account. This is definitely something to discuss with a tax advisor; I am not one. Risks Among the key risk factors that may affect their consolidated financial position and results are the prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, gasoline, diesel, ethanol, and even biodiesel. Energy prices, in general, will have an effect.
 NGL has a substantial amount of total debt, partly including inventory, but I expect them to be able to reduce their debt gradually. There is a high probability that another drop in share price could occur. If you are reading this, you are probably aware this is a volatile time in the oil and gas sector. Propane is also a large factor for NGL. 

USO data by YCharts Technical analysis When we take a look at the three-year chart, we can see that the price dropped from $25 to under $12 and started to rise (we can see a strong "downtrend" which has been broken). On this chart, I marked resistance and support levels. The support levels of $12 and $16 represent resistance. If the price jumps above $16, it would be a "BUY" signal and the price could easily rise to $20. Rising above $16 supports the continuation of a bullish trend overview efficiently for the upcoming period. If the price falls below $12, it would be a strong "SELL" signal and the price could easily drop to $10. 

 Source Conclusion My opinion is that NGL is well positioned for the future and is likely to be a highly profitable investment. NGL currently pays $1.56 in distributions per year for a yield of 11.14%, and 2018 is certainly going to be better than fiscal 2017. It wouldn't surprise me if NGL increases its distribution to at least 44 cents per quarter ($1.76 per year) next year. The 11.14% dividend is covered and the growth projects ensure that the numbers will be moving up in fiscal 2018.
 NGL reported FQ4 earnings and revenues, the latter rising 65% Y/Y to $3.85B vs. the ~$2.5B analyst consensus. NGL says adjusted EBITDA totaled $121M for Q4 and $380.8M for FY 2017, lower than the $154M for Q4 2016 and $424M for FY 2016. For FY 2018, NGL expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $500M-$525M, including $130M EBITDA for the Grand Mesa Pipeline (this pipeline is projected to make $10-12 million per month in EBITDA). At its current price, NGL is an excellent long-term investment with a very generous yield and solid growth prospects. If the price falls, any price in the range of $12 to $14 is an excellent opportunity to invest in NGL, and investors could certainly earn at least 30% within the next two years.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
