	Tuesday Morning Corporation Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results







	DALLAS, May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

	Tuesday Morning Corporation

	(NASDAQ:TUES), a leading off-price retailer currently with over 720 stores across the United States specializing in selling deeply-discounted, upscale decorative home accessories, housewares, seasonal goods and famous-maker gifts, today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2017.



	For the third quarter, net sales were $203.0 million, a decrease of $8.4 million from the prior year period.  Comparable store sales decreased 2.7%.  Operating loss for the third quarter was $14.7 million.  Net loss for the third quarter was $14.8 million.  Diluted loss per share was $0.34.  Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure which is described within this press release, was a negative $7.8 million for the third quarter.


	Steve Becker, Chief Executive Officer said, “Our third quarter comparable sales performance largely reflected decreased inventory levels in certain core categories in January and February as well as a late seasonal set.  As our inventory filled in, we saw improvement during the quarter and we have experienced positive comparable store sales growth in March and April.  We have now turned our attention to consistent improvement in our supply chain with a focus on driving our costs down.  While we have already made progress, we have considerable work to do and efficiencies to be gained.”



	Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Highlights:




	Net sales were $203.0 million, compared to $211.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  Net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by lower than plan store level inventories due to challenges in the Company’s supply chain operations and 24 fewer stores.  Comparable store sales decreased 2.7% compared to the same period a year ago, and were comprised of a 0.7% decrease in customer transactions and a 2.0% decrease in average ticket.  During the third quarter, seven stores were relocated, seven stores were opened, two stores were expanded, and 23 stores were closed, for an ending store count of 724 as of March 31, 2017.  Sales at the 44 stores relocated during the past 12 months increased approximately 47% on average for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year quarter and contributed approximately 250 basis points of comparable store sales growth.

	 


	The Company’s operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $14.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.

	 


	The Company reported a net loss of $14.8 million, or $0.34 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.12 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.

	 


	The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of negative $7.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million for the prior year period.  A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided below.




	Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results of Operations


	For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Tuesday Morning reported gross profit of $67.2 million and gross margin of 33.1%, compared to $77.5 million of gross profit and gross margin of 36.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to elevated costs associated with the Company’s supply chain operations, including distribution center and freight costs recognized in the current period, along with increased markdowns.  Partially offsetting this increase in costs was an improvement in initial merchandise mark-up.  Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased 1.9% to $81.8 million, compared to $83.4 million in the same period last year.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 40.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 39.5% in the same period last year.  This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher store rent and depreciation, due in part to the Company’s strategy to improve store real estate, and increased store labor costs in the current period as compared to the prior year period.  Additionally, the Company continues to invest in technology and infrastructure which drives incremental costs related to systems.  Partially offsetting these increased costs were reductions in corporate incentive compensation and certain other corporate expenses, including legal and professional fees, which decreased as a percentage of net sales in the current year quarter from the prior year quarter.  In the prior year period, the Company incurred $2.4 million of cease-use related rent expense for closed stores along with $1.2 million of SG&A expenses related to opening its Phoenix distribution center.  The Company reported a net loss of $14.8 million, or $0.34 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.12 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.



	Nine Months ended March 31, 2017 Financial Highlights:




	Net sales were $743.0 million, compared to $733.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016.  Net sales during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by lower than plan store level inventories due to challenges in the Company’s supply chain operations and 24 fewer stores.  Comparable store sales increased 2.3% compared to the same period a year ago, and were comprised of a 3.6% increase in customer transactions, partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in average ticket.  During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, 30 stores were relocated, 13 stores were opened, ten stores were expanded, and 40 stores were closed, for an ending store count of 724.  Sales at the 44 stores relocated during the past 12 months increased approximately 52% on average for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 as compared to the first nine months of the prior fiscal year and contributed approximately 290 basis points of comparable store sales growth.

	 


	The Company’s operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $15.2 million, compared to operating income of $8.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016.

	 


	The Company reported a net loss of $15.2 million, or $0.35 per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to net income of $7.6 million, or $0.17 per share, in the prior year period.

	 


	The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $7.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $28.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016.  A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided below.




	First Nine Months of Fiscal 2017 Results of Operations


	For the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Tuesday Morning reported gross profit of $250.5 million and gross margin of 33.7%, compared to $262.8 million of gross profit and gross margin of 35.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to elevated costs associated with the Company’s supply chain operations, including distribution center and freight costs recognized in the current period, along with increased markdowns.  Partially offsetting this increase in costs was an improvement in initial merchandise mark-up.  SG&A increased 4.5% to $265.6 million, compared to $254.1 million in the same period last year.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 35.7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to 34.6% in the same period last year.  This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher store rent and depreciation, due in part to the Company’s strategy to improve store real estate, increased advertising, and increased corporate labor and share-based compensation expense in the current period as compared to the prior year period due to executive vacancies in the prior year period.  Additionally, the Company continues to invest in technology and infrastructure which drives incremental costs related to systems.  Partially offsetting these increased costs were reductions in certain other corporate expenses, including incentive compensation, legal and professional fees, which decreased as a percentage of net sales from the first nine months of the prior year.  In the prior year period, the Company incurred $2.4 million higher cease-use related rent expense for closed stores than in the current year and incurred $2.9 million of SG&A expenses related to opening its Phoenix distribution center.  The Company reported a net loss of $15.2 million, or $0.35 per share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to net income of $7.6 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016.


	The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with $3.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and ended the quarter with a balance of $41.0 million borrowed under its line of credit.  Inventories at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $268.3 million compared to $255.0 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016, up $13.3 million or 5.2%.  The growth in inventory was driven primarily by increased buying, distribution, and freight costs which are capitalized into inventory.   The Company’s inventory turnover for the trailing five quarters as of March 31, 2017 was 2.4 turns, decreased from the trailing five quarter turnover as of March 31, 2016 of 2.6 turns.



	Outlook


	The Company currently expects to invest capital of approximately $37 million to $40 million in fiscal 2017, with a continuing focus on its real estate strategy for new stores, relocations and expansions of existing stores, and IT infrastructure and enhancements.

	The Company defines EBITDA as net income/(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash items and other items that the Company does not believe are representative of its core operating performance.  This measure is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as a measure of operating performance.  In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not presented as, and should not be considered as, an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP and should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by such adjustments.  The Company believes it is useful for investors to see these EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures that management uses to evaluate the Company’s operating performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are included to supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and because the Company uses these measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its business as a supplement to GAAP measures and believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures enhances investors’ ability to analyze trends in the Company’s business and evaluate the Company’s performance.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry.  The non-GAAP measures presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
