CN Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call will begin momentarily. I would like to remind you that today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such statements are based on assumptions that may not materialize and are subject to risks described in CN second quarter 2017 financial results press release and analyst presentation documents that can be found on CN’s website. As such, actual results could differ materially.
Reconciliations for any non-GAAP measures are also posted on CN’s website at www.cn.ca. Please stand by. Your call will begin shortly.
Welcome to CN Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Paul Butcher, Vice President Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Butcher.
Paul Butcher
Thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for CN’s second quarter 2017 earnings call. I would like to remind you about the comments already made regarding forward-looking statements. With me today is Luc Jobin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; JJ Ruest, our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; Ghislain Houle, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
In order to be fair for all participants, I would ask you to please limit yourself to one question. I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Luc Jobin.
Luc Jobin
All right, thanks very much, Paul. And welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. Well, today the CN team is pleased to report another very strong quarter. Our performance was driven by a sizeable increase in revenues, building on volume momentum, which started in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Our growth in the second quarter was also broad-based and achieved across most business sectors, translating into an 18% rise in RTMs. Meanwhile, we maintain our inflation-plus pricing discipline. JJ will give you more color on our record quarterly revenue performance and a sense of what’s in store for the second half of the year.
From an operating standpoint, Mike and his team worked very hard to accommodate this level of growth, while staying true to our commitment to balance service and efficiency. The result is evident in our operating ratio of 55.1%, up only 60 basis points versus last year, and our record operating income in the quarter.
Looking at the bottom line, the strength of our quarterly financial results speak for themselves; diluted EPS of $1.36, up 24%; adjusted diluted EPS of $1.34, up 21%; and solid free cash flow generation of $811 million in the quarter. Ghislain will expand on key financial highlights for the second quarter on the call later today and address as well our outlook for the year.

Let me now turn the call over to Mike, who will give you a sense for how the operating team has brought on board the substantial volume increase we’ve experienced thus far this year while maintaining our industry-leading performance. Mike?
Mike Cory
Thank you very much, Luc. And then first, let me just, happy anniversary to the team here in the room for a very successful first year together.
Overall, I’m extremely proud of the operating team’s performance in this quarter. It’s really a testament to their execution of our operational and service excellence agenda. Our volume growth in this quarter has been the largest in my 36 years with CN. And who would have ever forecasted a 175% frac sand increase in one quarter.
But that’s not the entire story. This increase is broad-based across business segments and operating regions. As a result of the volume increase, on top of attrition, we are hiring for all the operating groups. With new skill-set demands, with the evolution of PTC technology and automation bring, our attention to proper onboarding and integration is greater than I have ever experienced.
I’m really proud of what this team has accomplished so far and it’s a testament to the culture of excellence that we’ve created that we’re able to manage this type of growth and change environment and produce very solid results. So let’s take a look at those results.
The volumes in 2016 provided an opportunity to reduce people and assets. Most roads, if not all, saw the benefit of added capacity to more experienced workforces, line and terminal space, and less unproductive assets in the mix. Train speed, terminal dwell, fuel and locomotive productivity, all improved as a result. So for context, I’m using a similar volume period against the same infrastructure backdrop.
Actually, my comparison of 2015 isn’t exactly that, as workload or GTMs were 6% less in 2015 than they are in 2017. 2014 is actually a truer comparison workload or GTM-wise, but we did make infrastructure improvements in 2015, so I’m going to use 2015 as the example.
The biggest driver of locomotive utilization and car velocity is train speed. With the year-over-year growth, our train speed has declined and affected both of these metrics. However, in comparison to 2015, again, even though volumes were still 6% lower than this year, we improved our velocity while matching both train speed and locomotive utilization.
We did this through an aggressive approach to increasing train size, something that we will continue to focus on. On a productivity front, both our yard and train productivity improved over both 2016 and 2015. Our plan to tackle train speed reduction is in place. It includes both innovative approaches, as well as improvements that will be made through capacity and safety investments.
Our focus on efficiency and reliability with never weigh in, with a longer term plan to fundamentally change operations through technology, automation and optimization. The introduction of new operational and service systems will provide the opportunity for our customers to grow their market efficiently.
On the safety front, we continue to build the greater understanding of risk awareness within our team. We are capitalizing on our strong relationship with our operating unions to ensure everyone genuinely looks out for each other. Our [F reaction ratio] [ph] did increase from 1.57 to 1.61 on a year-over-year comparable. While, both those numbers are continues improvement over the last five year run rate, our accident costs this quarter well in line with previous year’s run rates were higher than in 2016.
For injuries, we are slightly up over our ratio for last year comparing the last five year run rate though we continue to improve on the absolute number. However, productivity improvements that reduced human work hours have affected the ratio.

To all of us, this slip is just not acceptable, in regardless of volume increase and mix of employee experience, we know that our most valuable asset is our people and we will correct this. Overall, we are working very hard to improve our safety record and have a number of initiatives headed up by newly developed an integrated team.
Overall, I am very pleased with team’s performance in the quarter with the volume growth, we definitely have challenging conditions to deliver these results. It’s clear the team came through once again, and I am grateful for the opportunity to lead them.
With that, over to you, JJ.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Well, thank you, Mike. And a great job on moving all these trains. Today, I’ll keep my comment to three high level topics. I will start with a high-level description of how we achieved success in the last quarter. Followed by last quarter major volumes and I’ll close with recent progress on our commercial agenda.
So let’s start with how we achieved success in the last quarter. First, we outperformed the economy. Our revenue was up $487 million, or 17% above last year. Year-to-date, our revenue was up almost $750 million or 13% above last year, more preciously $729 million.
We also outperformed the rail industry. CN’s AAR carloads were up 14.5%, which is the industry average of 6.7% in Q2. Year-to-date, our carloads were up 11.8% above last year, which is the industry average of 4.6%. Also very important to us is to achieve broad-based diversified source of growth, and to that point, all of our business units produced good growth this quarter. On top of that three segments have had all time record – company record, mainly international containers, automotive finished vehicle, and frac sand for oil and gas drilling.
Finally, we generated same-store price above real inflation at 2.3% for the quarter and 2.5% for year-to-date. I will now highlight selected segment that produced the most volumes. Frac sand as Mike mentioned was up 175%. Total Canadian grain carloads were up 23%. Container volume from Vancouver South Shore Vanterm and Centerm terminal were up a combined 135%.
Potash carloads were up almost 20%. Automotive carloads were up 9%, it is worth noting CN enrolled about 70% of all the finished vehicle sold in Canada. Coal carloads were down 3%, where revenue was up a solid 33%, because of business mix. The Port of Montreal and Halifax volume when combined were up 10%. Our volume for natural gas liquid, plastic pellets and condensates were down.
The Canadian dollar in our fuel surcharge program versus last year were both positive tailwind to our reported revenues, respectively $85 million for FX, $62 million for the fuel.
Now I will highlight recent progress on our commercial agenda. The new customers that we on-boarded earlier this year are delivering solid growth. The Port of Prince Rupert created an all-time high rail volume in June [at Goldomen] [ph] for the upcoming three years. [Saint Prolacerblair] [ph] Wisconsin opened a new frac sand mine on CN, and we expect another of our sand customers [Wisconsin Proppant Company of Exten] [ph] Wisconsin to further increase production on CN as well.
Crude volume bounced back from last year’s Fort McMurray fire. But the last Eastern Canada refinery that was using crude by rail will stop doing so sometime in late August. Whirlpool announced they will build a regional distribution center in our Calgary Logistics Park, which further progress our coal location strategy with distribution centers in Etimoro [ph]. But our strategy also applies to grain, where we have a number of grain country elevators either as newbuild of expansion of existing elevators to be done by Viterra, Cargill, GrainsConnect, G3, P&H, Aialta [ph].
And the same co-location strategy also applied to export transload, we have [Remo Logistics] [ph], who are building a major gain transfer facility in Rupert for this summer. CMA, the ocean shipping line will start a new service on the East Coast at the port of Saint John, New Brunswick, further building our three core strategic advantage. And the case for the port of Saint John, our strategy focus is on ocean container, on co-supply chain business and on bulk export of potash.

The new dilute Minnesota container terminal is now in operation, and we are also finalizing plans to have a container terminal service in Regina by the 2018 grain crop. This is further advancing our overall strategy of increasing our geographic reach by adding new and more destination.
And last but not least, our technology business team, which is now fully staffed, is in full project development mode to digitize CN next generation of supply chain services and build the foundation of our future competitive edge.
In conclusion to wrap this up, we have a good diversified quarter with a number of good business unit coming through with good results. The economic outlook for Q3 will constructive and we’re on to act for the full-year volume guidance.
Ghislain, you want to pick it up from here?
Ghislain Houle
Thanks, JJ. Starting on Page 11 of the presentation, I will summarize the key financial highlights of our solid second quarter performance. As JJ previously pointed out, revenues for the quarter were 17% versus last year at slightly over $3.3 billion. Fuel lag on a year-over-year basis represented a revenue tailwind of $20 million or $0.02 of EPS, mostly driven by an unfavorable lag in the second quarter of 2016 for the same amount.
Operating income was slightly under $1.5 billion, up $202 million or 16% versus last year. Our operating ratio came in at 55.1% or 60 basis points higher than last year. Fuel prices at no impact on the increase this quarter.
Net income stood at $1.31 billion or 20% higher than last year with reported diluted earnings per share of $1.36. Adjusted EPS was up 21% to $1.34 from a year earlier EPS of $1.11, excluding the impact on deferred income tax expense from the enactments of changes in provisional income tax rates in both years. The impact of foreign currency was $28 million favorable on net income or $0.04 of EPS in the quarter.
Turning to expenses on Page 12, as Mike previously pointed out, we continue to make progress in the quarter in terms of efficiency gain including discipline cost management initiatives despite a significant increase in volumes.
Our operating expenses were up 18% versus last year at just over $1.8 billion mostly driven by stronger volumes and higher incident costs. Express on a constant currency basis this represents a 16% increase.
At this point, I will refer to the variances in constant currency. Labor and fringe benefit expenses were $527 million or 10% higher than last year, as increased wages and incentive compensation expenses were partly offset by higher capital credits. On a full-year basis, we still expect pension expense to be roughly flat versus last year.
Purchased services and material expenses were $432 million or 12% higher than last year. This was mostly the result of higher outsourced services and repair and maintenance costs mostly driven by higher volumes. Fuel expense stood at $329 million or 30% higher than last year. Higher volumes accounted for $37 million increase and price was an unfavorable variance of $27 million versus 2016. Fuel productivity was about 1% improvement in the quarter versus last year.
Depreciation stood at $326 million or 8% higher than last year mostly as a result of net asset additions. Equipment rents were up 8% versus last year driven by increased car hire, partly offset by lower lease expense. Casualty and other costs were $117 million, which was $42 million higher than last year, mostly driven by higher incident cost of $21 million and an increase in environmental provision of $7 million.
For the balance of the year, we can expect about $90 million to $100 million per quarter for casualty and other.
Moving to cash on Page 13, we generated free cash flow $1,659 million through the end of June. This is $490 million higher than in 2016 and mostly the result of higher cash generated from operating activity, lower capital expenditures and lower cash taxes.

Finally, our 2017 financial outlook on Page 14. We achieved solid volumes in the first half of the year, reflecting strong performance across most segments. We continue to see favorable economic conditions in North America, including a stronger than expected Canadian economy. In addition, consumer confidence remains positive, while a strong energy sector is driving shipments of frac sands and steel pipes.
Crude volumes are strong, but this remains a spot business. However, we expect volume growth in the second half of the year to be more challenged as comparable with 2016 will be more difficult, particularly in the fourth quarter.
We believe this environment should continue to translate into volume growth of approximately 10% in terms of RTMs for the full year versus 2016 with overall pricing remaining above inflation. We have experienced – we have recently experienced the strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus U.S. dollar and assuming the current spot rate of around $0.80 this will create a headwind on earnings going [Technical Difficulty] U.S. dollar, results in an annual headwind on net income of approximately $30 million or $0.04 of EPS.
Despite the dollar headwind we are reaffirming our guidance and continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.95 to $5.10 versus 2016 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.59. In fact, to foreign exchange remained at $0.80, we could finish at the upper range – at the upper end of our range.
On the capital front, we remain committed to reinvesting in our business, to support safety, service and growth. In this regard, we continue to target a capital envelope of $2.6 billion for the year and about 20% of revenues going forward.
Furthermore, we continue to reward our shareholders with consistent dividend returns and we are on track with our current share buyback program of approximately $2 billion, having repurchased just over 14 million shares for $1.3 billion since last October.
In closing, we remain committed to our agenda and continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value today and for the long term.
On this note, back to you, Luc.
Luc Jobin
All right, thank you, Ghislain. So in closing, let me add a few words. Looking ahead, we hold a positive view of the economic environment and we expect to have volume growth in the second half, although we will be facing some tougher comps versus last year.
Our strategy of leveraging CN’s superior supply chain approach to grow faster than the underlying markets continues to bear fruits. And JJ highlighted a number of opportunities for us on the way forward. Mike and our operating team are energized and all hands are on deck to balance operational and service excellence.
Our focus remains on delivering value for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. In spite of a stronger Canadian dollars, Ghislain confirmed, that we’re also on track to deliver against our early outlook, both in terms of earnings and reinvesting in our franchise. So on that note, we’re happy to now take your questions and we’ll turn the call back over to you, Patrick.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your patience. The first question is from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ravi Shanker
Thanks. Good evening, everyone. A couple of questions, if I can squeeze it in, one is on pricing. Clearly, this is an industry-wide issue. And you guys saw a sequentially price deceleration like everybody else. But can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of this? And as inflation increased in the second half, what could be your sources of price again?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Hi, Ravi, it’s JJ. So at 2.3% I believe that we are in the range of our industry. We’re also in the range of the first quarter. On the grain side, we do seasonal pricing, so we don’t take the grain cap and spread over 12 months. We apply for that price increase when the demand is strongest and take it away when the demand is least. But at 2.3%, I think we are meeting our objective of same-store price, above real inflation. Real inflation is below that at this point. And I think the…

Ravi Shanker
And as it increase into the – sorry, go ahead.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
And I think there were [forward dust terrains] [ph] that we’re in as an industry.
Ravi Shanker
Good. Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Fadi Chamoun from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Fadi Chamoun
Okay. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. So, JJ, just a question on the crude by rail, which seems like it could be significant opportunity for you guys going into 2018 and maybe even at the end of this year. Can you give us your thought on this if you had any discussion with producers what this opportunity might look like and sort of potential timing of that ramp up?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes, I think, Fadi, I like one of your headlines from one of your report, where you say crude by rail opportunity, interesting, but not yet exciting, meaning there is not yet a capacity shortage of the pipeline capacity. So production is ramping up. Depending on who you talk to, it may be later this year or early this year. But production need to exceed pipeline capacity, at which time there will be a window for crude by rail to move product from Alberta to wherever the consumer within North America.
But at this point, it’s not part of really of a base-case that we expect a lot of crude by rail pickup in 2017 anyway. But if there is, we do have the network and a lot of power to do that. So we are in position to be able to do that. And in February the Canadian grain crop is little less than the average, that crude by rail will be a nice way to fill up the second and third quarter of 2018. At this point it’s a whole cart. It’s – we have to wait for the pipeline industry to be tight.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Walter Spracklin from RBC. Please go ahead.
Walter Spracklin
Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So, I guess, my – I want to focus here on grain and the outlook here. And I know moisture levels are pretty low on the prairies right now. So my question is how do you look at your forecast versus a fairly significant comp from last year? How should we be modeling an average crop or the risk that it goes below average. And do you expect that to be aggravated by any share loss relative to a fairly strong share gain you had last year? So could you talk whether you think you’re going to lose a little bit of share next year temporarily, if anything? And what the impact downside could be if we don’t get any rain in the prairies here in the near term?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
So if we take the usual pattern of the year, it’s JJ, in the third quarter what really matters is how early is the crop. Is it coming in – is it harvested in early September so we can move in September or is it coming in quite late where it’s too late for the third quarter. When it gets to the fourth quarter, every year might seem railroad very hard, because [we do the] [ph] crop is super big or less than average, everybody wants to sell grain in the fourth quarter so we run flat out, typically the same thing in wintertime.
So the size of the crop is really a second and third quarter 2018 question. And that’s really, I think it’s too early to tell. We will know by the time we have the third quarter results in the – in mid-October we will know how big is that crop, and then we’ll know the story for 2018. In term of share, I would advise that people not to bet against us. We’re pretty competitive when it comes to the marketplace.
Luc Jobin
Yes, we – let’s just say, Walter, that we don’t plan on losing share. And the rest for us is all upside and we’re focused on growing the business. So we’ll how – and we’ll see how things unfold.
Walter Spracklin
Great. Thank you very much.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.
Thomas Wadewitz
Yes, good afternoon. Just wanted to see if you had – I guess, we’ve heard from BSX [ph] and they’ve talked about some people from another organization that knows about precision railroading, that some operational talent has come over to them.
It’s not real clear what level or whether that’s from directly from your former CN people. But I just want to see if you could comment on whether there are concerned about any kind of operational managers being in – whether that is something you’ve seen at this point? Thanks.
Mike Cory
Hey, Tom. It’s Mike here. Yes, look, we’ve lost a few frontline supervisors, so really the effect is small, and just so everybody is clear. My job, my team’s job is to continue to key – teach, coach, develop people. So that we can look down the bench and always have the right amount – the right type of people in line. And right now, I look down the bench, and I’m extremely comfortable. So it’s a compliment for others to comment or emulator approach, and we’ll continue to develop people and go forward, but no issue on our part.
Thomas Wadewitz
Is there way to kind of frame the magnitude of it, like, it doesn’t sound like something you concerned about, but is there a way to say how many out of that level of – is it two out of 30 people at that level or anyway to kind of gauge it.
Mike Cory
I guess, I’d use the word – the word is not significant.
Thomas Wadewitz
Just not significant. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Mike Cory
Thanks, Tom.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Cherilyn Radbourne
Thanks very much, and good afternoon. I wanted to give JJ bit of a break by asking Mike a question. Obviously, continued strong performance in accommodating the volume growth that you had. And I think most of us in the call would have some familiarity with how mix can impact metrics like revenue per carload, or revenue per RTM.
But I just wondered, if you could speak in a bit more detail about how you look at those six key operating metrics, and assess them internally in light of a volume growth in mix to assess how well you’ve done?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Hi, Cherilyn. Really it’s been a little bit difficult of a year in terms of trying to compare it to a previous, especially 2016. With the volume growth itself – the key components here where we look at train speed, car velocity, locomotive productivity, locomotive utilization those things are going to have an impact from that much of a volume growth. We’ve identified clearly areas that we’ve got to get closer and diagnose the issue in terms of the train speed.
We’ve identified some pinch points, but really will do the same thing we always do that’s use an integrated team approach use all the resources we have and really look at the existing plan and infrastructure, and go from there. In terms of just pure productivity, our focus is on trainload on how we handle cars and costs to put them through yards, whether it’d be minimal yard, or whether it’d be switching yard those things never change, and that’s something that’s always right front center of us. If that helps answer any questions you have?
Cherilyn Radbourne
That’s my one. Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Cherilyn.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Group
Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I don’t know if this is for Luc or Ghislain. I just want to ask more broadly kind of the way the model is working. So there’s the second quarter in a row where revenue growth outpaced operating income growth. And is there, in your mind, something unusual the past two quarters just given either something on the cost side or just that magnitude of the revenue growth?

Or is this maybe we should think about the model going forward, and maybe more as we kind of look to the back half of the year, when revenue and volume growth decelerate into tougher comps. Should we still think about operating income growth growing slower than revenue growth?
Or do you think we should go back to maybe the normal way of thinking about rails where you see some operating leverage and operating income growth exceeds revenue growth? I know a long question, but hopefully you.
Luc Jobin
Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. It’s Luc. Listen, we don’t think that there is any significant change. It’s really a question of mix and how much business is coming on-board. In addition to that there are occasionally onetime items that can cloud a little bit the new analysis. So we still think that the historical model does work from time to time what will happen is, you’re bringing on board, a significant amount of volume. So in that sense your incremental margin is not going to be even and progressive, so I think that’s a little bit of what we’ve seen.
But if you take a step back and look at the first half of the year. Our incremental margin is probably sitting around 50% or something like that. And we look at the back half of the year Mike is in a good position to continue to improve on the operating metrics. And we feel pretty good that we can see potentially a little bit more operational leverage kicking in.
So the nature of the mix – and the nature of what we’re bringing on a lot of it is been long haul business, unit train, and in many cases, customer cars. So that also will tend to create some noise in terms of – if you’re looking at the revenue yield versus the operating profit yield. But we feel comfortable that there is no fundamental change in the model, and the way we look at the balance of the year in the way forward.
Ghislain Houle
And I – and Scott, this is Ghislain. I would also say that as in my remarks that we had a little bit of a spike up on a year-over-year basis on incident costs by about $21 million, so again that is reflected in the numbers. But through emphasize, Luc’s point, I think the model is working.
Luc Jobin
Thanks very much, Scott.
Scott Group
All right. Thank you, guys.
Ghislain Houle
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Turan Quettawala from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Luc Jobin
Go ahead, Turan.
Turan Quettawala
Sorry, I was on mute. Good afternoon. So I guess my question was on the fuel lag here. I was wondering, if you could talk about whether that has a benefit to you at all at end of the quarter, and maybe there’s something that could benefit you in Q3. And it’s going to be enough potentially at current prices to offset the FX impact?
Ghislain Houle
Yes, Turan, it’s Ghislain Houle. As I mentioned in my remarks, fuel lag helped us $20 million or $0.02 in the second quarter. And the third quarter very, very small, I would say, we’re looking possibly at a positive lag at this year about $10 million. So and there was nothing last year’s on a year-over-year basis, you could be talking about $0.01 in the third quarter.
Turan Quettawala
Great. Thank you very much.
Ghislain Houle
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ken Hoexter
Great, good afternoon. Can you just maybe JJ talk a little bit more about intermodal, I think you mentioned a new Regina container program for grain. Are you focusing converting bulk traffic over and away from the highway, and maybe talk a little bit about the benefits of the tightening U.S. truck market if you’re seeing that on growth opportunities yet?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Okay. So the initiative in Regina has to do with balancing the extension we have at Prince Rupert and Deltaport to offer the shipping line a revenue that makes sense for them. We need to offer them – is not only just a good destination, but also some revenue on the way back. And then Southern Saskatchewan, there’s big growth on the specialty crop, most of them are sold overseas, a lot of them are sold in containers. So two products, we’re going to be offering in order to do that. One is this summer.

Raymonde logistics, we will this transfer facility completed by the month of August in Rupert, it will be able to receive full unit train or specialty crops from anywhere in the prairies in the U.S., the loading container at the port itself.
And by the summer 2018, we will be able also to receive load container or specialty crop to be loaded in Regina, which is much closer to where products has being rolled. Regarding the question on trucking, I guess, it’s almost likely capacity and price – more price question. We’re not really seeing yet the tightening of the marketplace in the highway at least on what we do which is mostly repeat contract business, not truck business. That’s actually driving price yet on domestic intermodal.
So at this point that’s – I guess it’s something to come, but not there at this point. If that helps, Ken?
Ken Hoexter
Yes, does. Thank you very much, JJ.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Steve Hansen from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Steve Hansen
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. My question is on coal specifically. We’ve seen a pretty significant mix shift of late that I think you described in remarks. I’m just curious about your outlook here, the net side in particular and some of the traffic is coming out of the Northeast part of British Columbia, and what we should expect into the balance of the year or next year. Thanks.
Luc Jobin
Okay. Thank you, Steve. So the Canadian coal that we moved to West Coast is mostly in met coal, some term of also met coal. We also do quite a bit of petroleum coke from Northern Alberta that’s – which is also in our coal result that coke is mixed in the whole result. So those business where it’s tough [ph] coal from Fort McMurray or Canadian coal from Canadian coal mine in Eastern Alberta. I would describe in the study.
So now we are cruising phase and the sequential volume will probably stay at this. When it comes to U.S. coal, it’s whatever question mark for the fourth quarter. So why we’re not sure yet how much growth, we look at in fourth quarter in total is related to U.S. coal, it’s related to U.S. grain, and how that will find out, because U.S. crop doesn’t look fantastic.
And the crop in South America looks great. They have a lot of a lot of product. And we don’t know if we are going to be competing to move corn and soybeans to develop by unit train, but we’ll – a lot of that will end up moving by barges on the Mississippi, since the Mississippi barge rate are quite low.
Steve Hansen
Very good. Thanks.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandon Oglenski
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for get me on. I guess, want to revisit Scott question maybe in a different way, when we were at the Analyst Day last month, you guys focused a lot in the intermodal opportunity. So I guess just thinking into next year, if you’re going to see mix more from intermodal outgrowing rest of the business. Could this be a potential source of margin headwind as we would think about especially with the Canadian dollar strengthening, and could be 2018 maybe a continuation of the things we’ve seen in 2017?
Luc Jobin
Yes, thanks for the question, Brandon. It’s Luc. Listen again, we don’t really see that as taking shape. We’ve always said that the margin on the intermodal business is – on the average for the book of business. So in that sense, we don’t see a significant shift. And again, we’ve got the structure to actually take on the volume, so we don’t foresee a significant change.
Brandon Oglenski
Okay. Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
David Vernon
Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Luc, I wanted to kind of had a little bit on the same topic, it does look to me like the incremental diffuser [ph] about favorable benefit of the pension and even a little bit of a currency you’re running closer to 20%, and yet your volume growth is running at the high end that we’ve seen over the last 10 years. What is that taking away the normal volume driven leverage you would expect to see, if you’re getting price above inflation is kind of oil driven leverage, I would just sort of expected a better operating income result?

Luc Jobin
Yes, David, let me take a step back and kind of walk you through this a little bit, because this is a question that’s come up a couple of times, and I think we want to make sure people get a clear sense of what’s going on. A lot of the growth that we’ve had as actually been very much long haul business around coal, around potash, and frac sand and so on and so forth.
So it’s very good growth, but it’s long haul, it’s also as I mentioned earlier customer equipment. So when you look at the revenue what you’re going to get is – you’re going to get a lower revenue yield. So that’s not a factor of wheat pricing that is a factor of the revenue we charge for the book and haul business, and a lot of it is unit train as well. So that is – we have to this associate that from the cost structure because the pressure for moving that business is in fact lower, you don’t have to pay for the car supply and we do have a very good margin on that business.
So in effect, if you look at what’s happening in terms of the operating ratio, and leave aside some of the noise, which Ghislain referred to, which may happen from one quarter to the next, and some cases you’ve got FX, you’ve got fuel, and you’ve got some of the casualty costs that can distort a little bit your quarterly numbers.
But on the whole, As I mentioned earlier, when you look at the first half of the year and our incremental OR is 50%. So we are not seeing a shift away from profitability what happens is the mix and the nature of the business, we’re picking up, is leading to very strong GTMs and RTMs and – but the revenue profile is different.
So I think that is something that certainly was present in the first half of the year, probably, we’re not going to see as much of that in the second half, but there will be some. So you kind of have to work your way through the nature and the mix of business, and you have to look at other metrics not just your revenue yield to assess the quality of what we’re bringing on board in terms of growth as well as our efficiency numbers.
So when Mike looked at some of the operational product revenue numbers, again, they’re solid when you compare against similar work levels and volume levels back to 2015. So when you look at all of the other measures, you should gain some comfort that there isn’t something going on here, where we’re bringing on. What I would describe as low quality growth. That’s not the case.
And I mean again, the team is very much focused and very – we want to bring in good business on-board. But we also – as I said it can be lumpy, so in this quarter we picked up a lot of business and so between the first quarter.
And the team – the first mission for the team is bring it on – make sure that the levels of the service are good, and then we kind of look at grinding it out. So we’re constantly looking for opportunities where we can not only lower the cost of servicing the business. But it’s a matter of fact how can we enhanced the service levels.
So you will see that taking place, and that is why I think a longer term. We don’t feel that we turn – we have to turn business away. We have confidence that we can do it – we don’t – and JJ showed you with the pricing levels are, so we are very thoughtful in pricing of business and attracting good business and then working it through to maintain the profitability levels that have made us the leading class one in the space.
So all that to say, we feel pretty good about where we are, and we’ll continue to crank out of these numbers on the way forward, and probably you’ll see a little bit less of this pattern. But it will still be some certainly in the second half of the year.
David Vernon
And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that. As you think about grinding up is that a question of rewriting the contract or is it a question of maybe just getting it more ingrained in the operation, and catching up a little bit on the productivity side.

Luc Jobin
Yes, it’s not rewriting the contract, trust me. It’s the innovation. It’s pushing the envelope, I mean this is what Mike and his team, excel of doing day in and day out. So it really is looking at – where, and how can we improve, as I said on two key dimensions that we always focus on efficiency and service. And we – team’s mission and the team’s mandate is not to achieve one of the expense of the other. So that’s what you have to look at and keep your eyes on the team that that’s what they do best.
David Vernon
Thank you, Luc.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from the Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christian Wetherbee
Hey, thanks, good afternoon. I wanted to talk a little bit about the volume cadence in the back half of the year, so I think you had a couple of comments about some of the things that could be variables particular to the fourth quarter. But when you look at the RTM guiding your progress so far.
I guess, I’m just curious, what is the risk to the fourth quarter in terms of actually seeing negative RTMs that maybe what are some of those major variables, I am guessing grain, and I think you mentioned U.S. coal could also be part of it. But it’s running in a sense maybe with some more detail about what’s in those moving parts could be in the 4Q?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
So Chris, it’s JJ. When we get the fourth quarter, one of the thing, we’re unsure about at this point, one is U.S. coal. U.S. grain, the crop, but also what I move on the long haul railroad or short haul to the river. Sulfur is also a pressure mark for us, either liquid or going to the U.S. or dry going to the coast.
So it’s really typically is on the bulk side. And potash, Uralkali and Canpotex have both settled a contract with the Chinese, which means now the – all contract will be settled for all the countries. But we don’t know whether or not we will have the same record potash move than we did last year in the fourth quarter, which was very strong. And by the way, that’s an example of where Mike as we written how we do business.
When we move this product train from Saskatchewan to Saint John, we now move them 205 cars. Nobody moves a train of 205 in North America. So it obviously your cost per unit is down, and so we can compete on a lower cent per RTM and make money despite of that. So the fourth quarter question mark is more about the bulk side and what on earth we will have – be below last year or surprise ourself and be as good, I mean, better than last year.
We feel more confident about the rest of the economy.
Christian Wetherbee
But as it stands, you got positive RTM in your model for the fourth quarter.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes, [some, and then the place amount] [ph] we have negative RTM is bulk related and the uncertainty about the commodity which I talked about.
Luc Jobin
And clearly, Chris, I mean it is tapering down. There’s no question about that. But we don’t – as JJ pointed out, we don’t see negative RTM growth but there is a tightening up that will take place in the fourth quarter. So far, the third quarter is looking good.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes, first three weeks pretty good.
Luc Jobin
So we’ll have to walk it home.
Christian Wetherbee
Yes, great. Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Konark Gupta from Macquarie Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Konark Gupta
Thank you and good afternoon, just a question on metals and minerals. I guess, frac sand, iron ore and steel have driven the segment so far this year. So where you see trends in those commodities in the second half in 2018? Is there any stickiness basically in the existing frac sand business, if growth in drilling activity slows down more materially? Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest

Yes, it’s JJ. So, yes, there is stickiness in the frac sand business. We foresee frac sand sequentially stay at the rate where it is right now. They eventually will have, but we had a very strong second quarter frac sand. And if it sequentially maintains that rate it’s very positive.
When you look at the M&M, metals and minerals category, you have frac sand to that, you have steel, you have mineral, you also have iron ore. But the one that really is driving this category year-to-date is the frac sand. And we believe the frac sand will hold.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Konark.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Benoit Poirier from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Benoit Poirier
Yes, good afternoon, gentleman. JJ, a lot of color about the currency impact on translation and also on the EPS, but when you talk to customers I was wondering if you could point out the strength of the Canadian dollar, whether you see some potential impact on some commodity and whether it makes the Canadian ports losing some of their competitive advantage, so talking about grain, coal, forest product whether it could impact some volume in the longer term.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes, thank you, Benoit. So it’s still early on, it’s, well, a couple of cents, maybe up to $0.05. And I don’t know if the Canadian dollar will go up from this point for stay where it is. No, I don’t think – we don’t have customers at this point where those $0.04, $0.05 is going to have a material impact from their sales to the United States with sales abroad. Frankly, at $0.70, $0.72 Canadian, that was quite weak too. So one would not think the Canadian economy had to arrive such a weak dollar.
I think at this point, I mean, it’s not huge change, a couple of cents. Probably point of view of our customers in their production cost.
Benoit Poirier
Okay. Thanks for the color.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Benoit.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Brian Ossenbeck
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, Ghislain, going back to the Investor Day, you said the cost of Positive Train Control would increase and it wouldn’t be a small number. So Mike mentioned hiring some people for technology and PTC. And where does the OpEx and D&A stand related to that system right now? And where do you expect that to settle out when everything is on line, call it 2018, the first half subdivisions done in 2020 when everything is wrapped up?
Ghislain Houle
Yes, thanks, Brian. Yeah, PTC this year, I think what we’re looking at is possibly about $120 million. A third of that would be depreciation. And in terms of the future years, I think we’re not going to provide guidance for the future years. I think we’re very focused and the team is very focused on delivering. And we’re in the thick of it. And we’re advancing, so it’s good. And we’ll see, and frankly, we need to deliver PTC first before we know once we’re there how much it’s going to cost us to support it.
But we know this year that it will be $120 million, a third of it is depreciation.
Brian Ossenbeck
Okay. Thanks for the color.
Ghislain Houle
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Justin Long
Thanks and good evening. I know it may be a little bit early for this question. But I was wondering if you had any thoughts or expectations on this year’s peak season, just given some of your port capacity expansion projects, I thought you might have an early read. So I’m curious what you’re expecting and what’s baked into your guidance for the back half of the year?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Justin, it’s JJ. I think for us for this year, especially this year, the fact that Rupert’s capacity should be available to all of us by late August and the Deltaport sometime in the fall, might be more relevant than the fall peak at south, because now we have the ability to access a lot of capacity. And the question will be what are now RTM, [DP world] [ph] and GCT collectively would be able to sell some of that as early as August, September, October, November.

So we are planning for significant growth and obviously that’s our model all related to fall peak, but more about the capacity available to us and all the pre-marketing that we did about the service that we collectively offer, including the service that we have in south of Vancouver, which really helps, be a huge help to us in the last six months.
Justin Long
Okay. Great, but maybe just to follow up, as you stripped out that capacity addition that you have planned, does it feel like the underlying demand environment as it relates to peak will improve issue relative to last year?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
I wouldn’t say so. No, I don’t think the peak this year will be of a different trend or bigger than last year. But the Canadian economy right now is doing fairly good. So I mean the consumption by the Canadian consumers and the U.S. Midwest and U.S. Mid-American consumers seems to be solid and good. And obviously, we benefit from that as well.
Justin Long
Okay, great, I appreciate that.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Allison Landry
Good afternoon, thanks. Thinking about the guidance for the 10% RTM growth, you’re just basically implying a full-year number, which is, I guess, slightly above the peak that you saw in 2014. So are you at the point where you’re basically really needing to think about ramping up resources? And is it fair to say that you’re potentially approaching capacity levels? Mix I know is a factor. But in any way you could help us think through this would be helpful. Thanks.
Ghislain Houle
Yes, Allison, this is Ghislain. From a resource standpoint, we do and we are hiring. I mean if you look at the end of Q4 2016 versus the Q1 2017, we added about 300 people and our labor productivity in terms of million GTMs per employee was up 14%. When you look at the end of Q2 versus the end of Q1 we’ve added another 540 people, and again, our employee productivity was up 14%.
So we are adding people. We said we were going to do that. And we have to do that a little bit in advance, because there is a lead time to train these folks, whether it’s our crews or whether it’s engineering or mechanical folks. So we’re trying to be ahead of the game. But obviously as you can see from these statistics, we are we are not adding one for one, so we are absorbing.
And then, I’ll ask Mike to settle in on capacity. Mike and I, and JJ are connected very closer to hip. We’re looking at volumes coming. We’re always working together to see potential pinch-points, where they are. And we want to be ahead of the game. We want to be investing before it happens, but we don’t want to do that too early either. So we are currently investing to support our intermodal – business. We are investing to support our growth in frac sand.
From a capacity standpoint, we will continue to look at this and do that next year. So I think that it’s a lot of volume coming at us, so we’re pleased about the work that we’ve done. We’re pleased about the fact that we’ve been able to absorb and we’ll continue to absorb some of that volume. And we’re pleased about the fact that we’re trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of our investment.
Mike Cory
And I can’t add a whole lot and Ghislain said most. But I’ll refer to what Luc was talking about. Allison, we really – we clearly diagnose whatever the issue may be that’s creating what we might see to be a pinch-point. And before we spend, we look internally whether it’s infrastructure we already have, whether it’s some innovative way to approach it. But that’s been our template for a long time and that will continue.
But to Ghislain’s point, we know the areas that we’ve seen extreme growth. We know the areas that we’ve seen train speed drop to a degree. We definitely come together as a group and we’ve identified lot of things we’re going to do and we’ll see where that takes us and we’ll do what we have to do in order to service the customer the way they expect and need, and the way we need to keep the cost down.

Luc Jobin
And, Allison, just to put icing on the cake here, you’re getting all – three for one. I would say – it’s Luc, I would say that, what we constantly do is we triage and we prioritize where we see the most leverage and the most opportunities for deploying capital. So that is always – what we’ve talked about is within the scope of our capital envelope.
And what we do is we prioritize depending on where and how we see the opportunity. So you shouldn’t expect a significant shift in the profile of our CapEx over time. It should be in line with what we’ve described at the Inventor Day. Thanks for your question, Allison.
Allison Landry
All right, thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from David Tyerman from Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.
David Tyerman
Yes, so just following up on the comments on hiring. So should we expect hiring to continue at 300 to 500 people additional or does it slowdown quite a bit as the volume growth slows down?
Ghislain Houle
Listen, I think I’m not going to give you, David, a specific number. What we are going to do is continue to – we will hire. We were looking at what’s ahead of us, but we’ll not hire one for one. So that’s the key and we’re going to continue to absorb some of that volume with the service and the operations that we have so.
David Tyerman
Okay. Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thanks, David. All right, well, thank you for the questions. Obviously, we’re very pleased and we’re very proud of our second quarter results. I think they continue to support what we have been doing for several years in terms of advancing our strategy and gaining traction in the marketplace. And we continue to see future growth ahead of what the base markets can bring to us.
We’ve got a lot of good initiatives going on. Our offering in the marketplace is resonating with customers. So we feel good about our ability to attract and retain and work through, efficiently work through the business that we’re bringing onboard, so a good quarter, a very good quarter actually when you look at these numbers. And I think the year is shaping very well. And again, we’re restating our guidance and we’re staying – in spite of some of the changes in currencies and other little headwinds, we’re staying the course.
So we’re looking forward to bringing you up to date when we have our third quarter call. And in the meantime, thank you for joining in and we’ll see you later.
Mike Cory
Thank you.
Ghislain Houle
Thank you. Have a great summer.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Patrick.

Thank you, Greta. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to remind you of the comments already made regarding forward-looking statements.
With me today is Luc Jobin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; JJ Ruest, our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; and Ghislain Houle, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
As to our prepared remarks, we will conclude with the question and answer session. In consideration of your time we are trying to keep this call to one hour and I will ask that you please limit yourselves to one question. I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Luc Jobin.
Luc Jobin
Thanks very much Paul and let me in turn welcome all of you to CN’s quarterly call. Today we will review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2016. The CN team is pleased to report another very strong quarter, one that cast the solid year of performance both financial and operating, including significant improvement in terms of safety, service and productivity.
These results continue to show how CN is adapting to changing market conditions, ceasing opportunities every day whilst positioning for the future. We achieved strong results in the fourth quarter with an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.23 and that’s up 4% versus last year’s fourth quarter. We also saw positive momentum on volume with RTMs up 4%. That’s an encouraging sign that the worst of the market correction in several commodity sectors is behind us and brighter prospects lay ahead. JJ will give you more color on this in a minute.
In terms of operating performance, we delivered very good metrics despite a more difficult winter in December of last year. Looking at full year results we are very proud of our performance especially given how challenging the year has been from a market standpoint and so for 2016 we achieved a full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% to stand up $4.59.
We also delivered a record-breaking operating ratio of 55.9% that is a full 230 basis points better than last year. It’s very tough to achieve this level of results and the entire CN team deserves credit, since we accomplish this with a clear view to meet high service levels and supply chain collaboration but not undermine our ability to grow as the market improves.
Mike will give us a good look at how innovation, productivity and teamwork has been instrumental in reaching this milestone. In 2016 CN generated free cash flow of $2.5 billion up 6% versus last year. And last but not least, we announced today a 10% increase in our dividend. Later on the call, Ghislain will expand on other key financial metrics for Q4 and the full year as well as provide you with our earnings guidance for 2017 along with some key assumptions.

Let me now turn it over to the team for their more detailed commentary starting with Mike Cory. Mike?
Mike Cory
Well, thank you Luc. The CN team of professionals deserves accolades for achieving very good results for the fourth quarter in spite of the impact of December’s winter comeback story.
I’ll go into further detail on the subject of winter a little later. On the full year basis the overall results were outstanding and they reinforce a supply chain approach. This is an approach that produces premium service at the lowest possible cost by understanding the customer demand in executing our operations to efficiently deliver it.
On a full-year basis, all of our key operating metrics see previous records with the exception of train speed. Train speed was slightly down since our record performance of 2010, however volume is up 24% and trains are carrying 16% more payloads since that time period.
For Q4 workload, and are measuring this in GTMs we were up 8.4% in Q3 and up 4% from Q4 of 2015. In Q4, we set an all-time record for train productivity at 9449 tons per train which is 5% higher than last year’s Q4. We also set a Q4 record for locomotive utilization which was up 7% year-over-year, all this was accomplished against the very tough comparable with a significant headwind of winter in December that we do not experience last year.
In fact, going back over the last five years, the month of December 2016 was the second coldest with more days colder than minus 20 degrees Celsius than any other period for one year. As well, the snowfall we experienced was the second highest in the last five years and our major operating yards in Winnipeg recorded the highest level of snowfall in the history of the City.
Considering the dramatic change in weather this December brought our response was swift and it ensured our game plan of operational and service excellence remained intact. In fact, I can objectively say that in my 35 years in this industry and you have to remember a good majority of that's been in operations in Western Canada, we have not performed this well in the type of winter conditions we were faced within December in all of my recollection.
We were able to deliver these results because our focus is on two tracks, and the first track is really about the day-to-day management of our business. We focus intensely on our metrics. Our attention to detail is second to none and continuous improvements if you will lead us to meet the demand of our customers efficiently. The other track is aligned to the future. We invest time and capital to continue to create more efficient solutions for customers.
In turn, we create reliability, efficiency and business growth in the long term. This track allows for innovation that produces results. Our investments in assets like AC locomotives, network and yard improvements, technology to reduce the impact of weather and increase our service offering for customers have created an environment of innovation, and I’ll tell you that environment is something our team takes full advantage of.
Our alignment with JJ and his team on developing and delivering a series of superior product offering constraint supported by investments in both network and locomotive capacity has produced by far the best movement of grain and not only over a winter period but a reigning period in recent history. This alignment trends in across all business segments and allows for a clustering of innovation and ideas that continue to drive our results.
Now I said it before but no one metric generates these results on its own, it’s all about balance. And we believe our model of operational service excellence with a view to the future is what delivers results that are best in class.
One last point of thanks to our operating team leaders, they believe in and they deliver our plan, they sacrifice for their teams and they create the environment that allows this success to happen. So we have work to do, but good work is being done.

Over to you JJ.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Well thank you Mike. Great operating results by the operating team of CN. The fourth-quarter revenue of CN was up $51 million or 1.6% versus last year. The CN carload was up 3.4%, the revenue ton mile was up 4.2%, both were above the industry average.
Q4 was broadly as follows; revenue increase from volume was about 3.5%. Our most positive business for Canadian and U.S. going, market share gain and refined petroleum products and automotive, U.S. housing start was driving our lumber and panel. Our intermodal from the East Coast did well, and finally we had recovery in Canadian export of Pet coke and potash.
On the negative side, less long haul of crude by rail, less U.S. terminal coal and less sulphur. The applicable fuel surcharge lowered our revenue by about 1% and the all-in same store price on same store sales was up 2.7%. When excluding the regulated grain, same store price was up 2.4%.
The Canadian dollar had no impact on revenue this past quarter. I will now go through some selected details and outlook of our very diversified portfolio. Starting with grain, our grain operation was very fluid as my partner Mike just described earlier, we did a great job especially in December, which meant that for U.S. grain that when I look at the as reported Q4 our carload we were up 8000 cars and the revenue reported revenue was up 19% or $30 million. This was driven by soybean and corn export.
On the Canadian grain when you look at it on the as reported on the Q4 AAR carloads we were also up about 6000 cars, these are longer haul and the reported revenue was up 13% or $40 million. This was driven by strong export of canola and by all peak season pricing program.
We had solid carload performance during the month of December where the prairie was very cold and which is really the result of past capital investment in our network that we can now benefit and really and as Mike described is a strong team operation of winter preparation but also in partnership with our grain customers.
Under AAR Q4 carloads we move 87000 cars of Canadian grain which is notably 12,000 more than our counterparts. The future of our grain franchise and grain market share is to grow. We do have better yield for acreage, there is more acreage being planted and we do have a number of commercial agreement already in place with customers that were located on CN about two third of the next wave of Prairie elevated construction in the next few years.
Staying with bulk commodities, potash produced 20% incremental revenue while sulphur from oil and gas declined 30%. Q1 outlook for potash carloading is positive for Canpotex export via Vancouver but is also positive at these coasts where we use our new 29000 ton unit train to the Saint John potash terminal.
Overall core revenue for [CN and total] was down 6%. Our U.S. terminal core revenue was down. To note, effective January 1, we lost a short haul Midwest utility contract that in 2016 was worth $13 million Canadian for CN and business about 42,000 carloads, these were short haul carloads.
On the flip side, Canadian met coal was up 13% versus last year, but the volume trends have turned around. CN and the met coal have increased their production in response to better oil pricing. Three of our idle Canadian coal mine were acquired by the company called Conuma one mine did restart and is now in full production and Conuma is looking to restart the second mine this year. We also have two other idle mine in CN which are also under restart consideration.
Our met coal and pet coke exports should be growing in 2017. Housing starts drove our lumber and panel revenue which was up 4% versus last year.
The lumber and panel shipment to the U.S. increased 6%. The expiry of the softwood lumber agreement October 12 had little impact on our car orders which remained consistent during the quarter and into this month, driven by U.S. housing start in the range of 1.2 million units per year.

Moving to customers' purchase of motor vehicle. Our automotive as reported on the Q4 AR carload was up 5000 cars and on a reported revenue basis were up 6%.
Vehicle sales were favorable and we also gained new business from a few contract renewal. This year in 2017 we expect our automotive carload to grow and CN is now touching close to 70% of all the finished vehicles sold in Canada.
Regarding energy, our carload for crude by rail was about 15,000 for the past quarter and 52,000 carload for 2016. Crude has sequentially improved during the fourth quarter. We also had share gains in refined petroleum products such as propane and motor fuels, which produced solid revenue growth which should continue in the first quarter.
On frac sand, our revenue was up 7%, the resurgence in drilling activities have sequentially improved sand carloads during the fourth quarter. [Intermodal] revenue was up only 1% domestic volume growth was modest mostly coming from door-to-door service from our industrial carload customers as well as from the Canadian retailers.
The hub to hub wholesales and cross border business stayed weak. With the growing numbers of shipping line partners now doing business with CN, we had a much bigger pool of international containers at our disposal this year to grow our domestic repo program.
As the International volume was flat and Rupert after Hanjin filed for bankruptcy in September, we are well aware -- well on the way to recover the volume with other shipping line especially with the DP oil terminal expansion coming soon in July and the reshaping of the world shipping line alliance which will come into effect sometime in May.
In Vancouver, all of our major contracts are renewed. Starting this month we picked up the [Indiscernible] business and Mike’s team is putting new service in place for the container business offloaded at Vanterm and Centerm terminal solving the congestion issues.
Also notable, at the end of April, we will see a final phase of the railyard construction at Deltaport which will create 40% more rail capacity than what’s available there today. On the East Coast, our Halifax position in the [Indiscernible] is growing; revenue growth was about 17% in the fourth quarter.
The port of Montreal is also doing well growing 15%. One team that we are very very proud and we want to emphasize is how the team we are going to supply chain partners is all of us to be able to grow these businesses.
Rail volume from the Gulf coast is still building very slowly. And one other thing to add is, we will be adding an incremental ramp in Minnesota sometime in the first quarter.
Finally, iron ore, our combined iron ore rail, dock, and vessel business increased 8% in revenue in the last quarter. The outlook for iron ore is positive. There is less field being dumped in the United States. There is strike in auto manufacturing, there is prospect for U.S. infrastructure spending and the CapEx expenditure from the oil and gas industry is getting healthier.
In closing, we had the constructive volume given the momentum we saw since last September which has been sustained in the first weeks of this year. We are aiming to outperform the rail industry average as it relates to volume growth.
On the pricing side, the pricing environment remain influenced by excess capacity in all mode of transportation, however we are seeing some early signs of tightening and discipline. We continue to expect pricing to be above rail inflation in 2017.
Thank you. I think I will turn it over here to Ghislain, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ghislain Houle
Thanks JJ. Starting on page 11 of the presentation, I will summarize the key financial highlights of our solid fourth quarter performance. Then I will comment on our full year 2016 performance and finally I will provide our guidance for 2017.

As JJ previously pointed out, revenues for the quarter were up 2% versus last year at slightly over $3.2 billion. Fuel lag on a year-over-year basis represented a revenue headwind of $24 million or $0.02 of EPS driven by an unfavorable lag this year of $10 million versus a favorable lag of $14 million experience in Q4 of 2015.
Operating income was just shy of $1.4 billion up $40 million or 3% versus last year. Our operating ratio came in at 56.6%, a record for fourth quarter and representing an improvement of 60 basis points over last year.
Other income was $91 million compared to $16 million in 2015. This increase is the result of the gain on aligned sale in Montreal of $76 million or $66 million after tax. 
Net income stood at [$1.018 million] or 8% higher than last year with reported diluted earnings per share of $1.32 versus $1.18 in 2015, up by 12%. This includes the gain on the one time aligned sale I just mentioned. Thus excluding this gain adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.23 up $0.05 or 4% versus last year. The impact of foreign currency on an income EPS was negligible in the quarter.
Turning to page 12 as Mike previously pointed out; we continued to make progress in the quarter in terms of productivity gains, including cost management initiatives while providing superior service.
Our operating expenses were up 1% versus last year at just over $1.8 billion, mostly driven by higher volumes versus last year. As the average exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was essentially the same as last year, both actual and constant currency variances are the same.
Labor and fringe benefit expenses were $565 million, 7% lower than last year. This was mostly the result of lower wages and pension expense, partly offset by higher incentive compensation. Wage costs decreased by 2% as wage inflation was more than offset by a reduction of about 5% in average head count for the quarter versus 2015.
At the end of the year we still had about 500 employees laid off and we finished 2016 with 4% fewer employees or roughly 800 less than last year.
Pension expense was $46 million favorable this quarter, ending the year with a higher than expected tailwind of $195 million mostly driven by the adoption of the spot rate approach to estimate current service cost and interest costs.
As interest rates moved up, since the third quarter and the discount rate finished at 3.81% at December 31, pension expense will be roughly flat in 2017 versus 2016 on a year-over-year basis.
Finally, these items were partly offset by higher incentive compensation of $15 million in the quarter versus last year.
Purchase services and material expense were $428 million, 2% lower than last year. This was mostly the result of higher credits, driven by our capital program and lower repair and maintenance costs, partly offset by higher outsourced services.
Fuel expense came in at $312 million or 3% higher than last year, mainly attributable to stronger volumes partly offset by fuel productivity which was up by 2.5% versus last year.
Depreciation stood at $310 million, 7% higher than last year. This was mostly a function of net asset additions. Equipment rents were down 7% versus last year driven by lower lease expense due to return of lease cost.
Finally, casualty and other cost was $111 million, which was $40 million higher than last year mainly driven by our annual actuarial true-up for legal claims of $25 million and a workers’ compensation credit of around $15 million recorded in Q4, 2015.
Let me now turn to our full year results on page 13. We completed 2016 with revenue slightly above $12 billion or 5% lower than 2015. However, our operating expenses at around $6.7 billion were 8% lower than last year producing a 1% increase in operating income versus 2015.

The operating ratio stood at an impressive 55.9% which as Luc indicated is a full 230 basis point improvement versus our all time record of 58.2% set last year. This demonstrates our continued ability to balance operational and service excellence consistent with our supply chain focus in good and tougher time.
Net income was up roughly a $100 million were 3% at just over $3.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the one time line serve in 2016 and income tax adjustments in both years, adjusted diluted EPS for 2016 came in at $4.59 up 3% versus 2015, quite a performance in an environment for volumes in terms of RTMs were down 5% for the year.
Now moving to free cash flow on page 14 for the full year 2016 we generated just above $2.5 billion of free cash flow which is close to $150 million or 6% higher than in the prior year.
This was mostly driven by improvements in net income, lower cash taxes and higher proceeds on sale of property. Our capital expenditure finished roughly at our budgeted $2.75 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with debt and leverage ratios well within our guide lines.
Finally, let me turn to our 2017 financial outlook on page 15. We are cautiously optimistic with regards to CN’s prospect for the year and while we see volume growth in 2017 we are continuing to experience some volatility and weaker conditions in a number of commodity sectors.
As we look into 2017 North American economic conditions are improving with favorable consumer confidence which have support progress in many sectors. In addition we are leveraging our superior service to continue to gain market share in key customer service sensitive markets.
While energy market mainly crude and frac sand have demonstrated sequential growth since trough experienced in the second quarter last year. We still expect this sector to remain relatively muted in 2017.
So this environment should translate into volume growth in the range of 3% to 4% in terms of RTMs with the full year versus 2016 while overall pricing above inflation. Therefore we expect to deliver EPS growth in the mid-single digit range over 2016 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.59.
We remain committed to reinvesting in the business for the long run with the capital envelop of $2.5 billion for 2017. We will allocate $1.6 billion for basic track infrastructure supporting our safety agenda and an investment of around $400 million will be allocated to PTC as we continued to advance the implementation of a program.
Furthermore, we continue to pursue our shareholder return agenda. In 2016 we return to shareholders roughly 90% of our net income through dividends and repurchases. In our current share buyback program is approximately $2 billion in 2017.
Finally, we are pleased to announce as Luc mentioned that our Boards of Directors have approved a 10% dividend increase for 2017 reflecting our solid performance in 2016 and our confident in the future as we move toward a 35% dividend payout ratios.
In closing, we’ll remain committed to our agenda of operational and service excellence with our supply chain focus and we continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value for our customers and shareholders today and for the long-term.
On this note, back to you, Luc.
Luc Jobin
All right. Well, thank you very much, Ghislain, JJ and Mike. I think what we’ll do now is we’ll turn, we’ll open the lines to take your call. So we are now ready to take the calls.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Jobin, we will take questions. [Operator instructions]. The first question is from [Wayne McDonnell] of CN. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
That was a mistake. There are no questions. I was just listening to the call.
Luc Jobin
All right. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you very much. The next question is from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed.

Brandon Oglenski
Hey. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. So, Luc or JJ, can you just give us some feedback? Obviously, the landscape or at least the future landscape for NAFTA has change a little bit with the U.S. elections. Have you gotten any feedback from your customers? I mean has anything structurally changed yet and are you rethinking your capital allocation process? I mean, when you think about some of the assets that are involved in North America trade, especially some other railroad stocks and valuations have come down a lot now, does that make you think strategically a little bit differently about the outlook?
Luc Jobin
Yes. Thanks Brandon for your question. Well, just talking little bit about NAFTA, I mean again from the Canadian perspective we are cautiously optimistic, again we’ve been long trading partners with the United States and there's a lot going on and there is a certainly a relationship which is very different between Canada and the U.S. versus Mexico and U.S. So, the balance trade is much more – a much closer and we also -- when you look at the manufacturing jobs that moved. They moved out of Canada and out at the U.S. and in many over to Mexico.
So, if you look at what might be more affected certainly the automotive sector both parts and new cars with the potentially at the crosshair of that, but that’s a very small percentage of what we actually export to the U.S. Southbound. So, we don’t expect any significant change, I sees not in the foreseeable future and I think most of our customers and JJ can supplement, are taking the same sort of optimistic yet cautious approach and we’ll have to work things out, but generally what we've been hearing from the U.S. folks is encouraging and we’ll have to kind of work through it.
There is free trade agreement which predate NAFTA and so there’s a long-standing relationship of bilateral negotiations and working out issues. As it relates to how this may affect other railways. At this point it hadn’t necessarily changed our views. I think it's still too early to call the game and so we’re going to have to see how things evolve and where the dust settled in the end. JJ anything you want to add in [terms of any].
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes. That’s been my opening comments, we are constructed about the volume outlook. We are aiming to outperform the rail industry average and after three weeks we're leading with 5.5% carload growth. And also we look at the U.S. I mean, we got about 17 or so percent of our business which is domestic U.S. Brandon, so I think there are plenty of opportunities for us to grow as potentially more manufacturing and more jobs get created in the U.S., so we’re looking forward to that. Thank you.
Brandon Oglenski
No problem.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC. Please proceed.
Walter Spracklin
Very much, good afternoon everyone.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
How you’re doing Walter?
Walter Spracklin
So I guess, the most common question I get is on your [OR] improvement in and how you can get much lower and it seems to be the question that recurs every year and you do deliver on that. So I guess I'll ask it again, Mike you've got and you’ve demonstrated some significant trends and improvements that seem to look like they’re going to carry forward in the next year. Look, you talked a bit about technology investment, is there any sense, is our improvement in the cars for next year and can you give us some insights into what your assumption is for OR that the drives your current EPS guidance?
Mike Cory
This are the tough one, Walter, we can never answer it seem. So I’m going to give you this. I’m going to give you four points that are basic to what I would say fundamental success in railroading. The first thing that we focus on is understand what we’re trying to accomplish. From that we set plans that have targets that require improvement whether we put one less asset into the plan, one less person whatever it is we set very tough target. And then we measure them religiously. And when we see something we take action immediately.

Now, that's all I’ve done with strong leadership, the sacrifice I talked about, that will get strong work. That’s we’ll strong war. We’ll never stop doing that. The thing is the investment, the item of the future technology. We have everything in the works. We just expect to continue to improve on not to OR, but every aspect of the business that we go after.
Luc Jobin
Yes. Thanks Mike. And Walter, I mean, it’s always a balancing act. I mean, what try to is be as productive as we can, and as Mike pointed out to drive down costs where we’re not see necessarily adding the whole lot of value. The flip side is we are set on gaining traction in the market place, so we’re not shy about if we see opportunities and we want to invest a little bit and getting that business on board, we can do so.
Our low OR allows us some flexibility and our confidence that we can continuous improvement that we can bring on new business and drive it to a level of productivity that’s our strength. And so, all that to say, we’re not going to guide on ore and we’re always trying to solve for what’s the best bottom-line and sustainable growth that we can bring on the network, and it will bounce around a little bit given sometimes you’ll have weather that comes into play and at a times you’ll have a few other things that can cause it to bounce around.
But I think we just deliver and you can rest assured that team here is set on growing the business and doing so as efficiently as possible, but not at the expense of more service offering. And that’s the key, that’s the magic to the equation here.
Walter Spracklin
Okay. Thank you very much.
Luc Jobin
Walter, we look forward to the question next year.
Walter Spracklin
Thanks.
Luc Jobin
All right.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Ravi Shanker
I want to follow-up on that question, the risk of maybe asking the same question again in different way. If I were to kind of try and bridge your topline guidance to your EPS guidance, it does look like you said 3% to 4% volume growth and pricing over inflation, that by itself should get you to something close to mid single-digit EPS growth not to mentioned as you said continuous OR improvement and buyback on top of that. I just want to make sure that there isn't something you're missing in terms of a headwind to earnings next year kind of below the line or at our lines itself?
Luc Jobin
Well, I mean, you’re not missing much, I mean, the reality is, again I mean we set out and we look at – we have as much visibility than anybody else, so we take a few and I think that what we’ve said is a fairly constructive view in terms of a number of commodity sectors seem to have stabilized and are showing encouraging signs of progress. So, the guidance that we’ve provided in mid single-digit is the reflection of what I would describe as that volume growth, the pricing that we talked about and continuing to deliver solid operating metrics including OR. So, that’s the equation and if you solve for that you get mid single-digit.
Ravi Shanker
Great. And can just have one more, on the shared gains, you certainly had a very good recent track record with the picking up share. Where are we with that shift, I mean, do you think that’s kind of normalized between you and your chief peer or do you there are more opportunities out there? Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
There is more opportunity, as geographic expansion or serving customers who are today we’d like to get a better service. So now there, I would not discount potential to – getting to which market, but there is some business saw there, that we think we could that maybe the customers would like to have business with us?
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Ravi. Appreciate it.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Fadi Chamoun of BMO Capital Markets.
Fadi Chamoun 
Yes. Good evening. Just a clarification, I’m not sure I said that. Does the guidance include a buyback for 2017? And secondly for JJ, when you look at the what's going on with the new alliances, ocean’s helping alliances, do you feel unbalanced that this is something that creates opportunities for you to fill that incremental capacity on the West Coast or does it represents more of a risk of this stage, any visibility on that would be good?
Ghislain Houle
Hi, Fadi, this is Ghislain. For your first question, yes, the guidance includes a $2 billion program for share buybacks in 2017. But then JJ if you want to say.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes. Fadi, on the ocean shipping, all the ocean shipping alliance will make into effect May 1st, this is where all the musical chairs, when the music stop and everybody has a different chair. It does provides some kiosk in the marketplace if you wish from point of view, at the same time in the case of Rupert because the expansion is coming in June and July, I’m sorry and we’ll have the second, but it does provide opportunity. We are selling what the Hanjin and Rupert right now very hard.
And in the case of Vancouver with Delta Port having this rail on the capacity up a 40% by the end of April, it also offered opportunity for us and our partners to go out and sell to for bigger ship, bigger ship having bigger discharge, and if the ship coming as a first part of call whereas Vancouver it really gives us a great service to go and sell into market where our and to that market where market share today is suboptimal. So lastly, we were restricted the capacity. I think this year we have an open field as of sometime in the spring and we are running hard to exploit all we can out of that.
Fadi Chamoun
Thanks very much.
Ghislain Houle
Thanks Fadi.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Jason Seidl
Thank you, operator, and thank you for taking the time. I wanted to go back on pricing side; I think earlier on you mentioned that things were starting to tighten up. I was wondering if you can give us a little more color as to where you starting to see that, and sort of, are you starting reprice contract at a little bit better way than you thought you were?
Luc Jobin
So, I think there are few – the line was not that great. Your question was around pricing and pricing outlook getting slightly better. Is that right, Jason?
Jason Seidl
That is correct, yes.
Luc Jobin
Yes. So, definitely the last two years have been little more challenging than the years prior to that partly because the capacity of all more available, we see, I think on the trucking side there’s been less equipment been purchase, the people have cut to vacant their capital expenditure. On the rail side the capacity is going to be tightening. This is where you’re going to get into commodity by commodity. Now railroad may have a lot of locomotive but they may no longer the specific type of gondola or specific type of rail equipment that a customer is looking for.
So this is where you start getting to the sub-segment of, I do have crews network capacity and I have locomotive, but don’t have any more center beam or I don’t have any bi-level or on the trucking side I think people can only do so long at calling low price and year after cutting low price and then eventually start to get the result of what the living as a result of this low price. So I think the discipline often comes back as a result of phases with some pain and then each market players I think would like to eventually slightly better price, and each market players is also in some cases or at least in some equipment getting to the point, we get to invest new capital money and now they look at it differently, still longer in incremental sale, it’s the sale has to pay for their newer railcar that they have to bring in.

Jason Seidl
Okay. And how much your book of business is already priced at 2017?
Luc Jobin
Same as in the past, we sign a multiyear contract and so we’re probably turning the book of business maybe like every three years or so.
Jason Seidl
Okay.
Luc Jobin
Thank very much.
Jason Seidl
Guys, I appreciate the time.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed.
Tom Wadewitz
Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could offer within the volume growth guidance that you said three to four, is there a mix effect that would be meaningful and then positive or negative that might kind of translate to revenue growth in a certain way and then I don’t know if -- just a kind of little more color on that intermodal volume outlook, it sounds like there was potential but it was kind of has been weak recently, so any thoughts on those do appreciate it? Thank you.
Luc Jobin
On intermodal we haven’t hit I will stride yet, I think we were negative for a while and now we’re flat and we now hoping for better days to come in spring and summer time for the reason I mentioned earlier. And yes, I think the mix has changed quite a bit last, short-haul business been last, long-haul business been gain, long-haul crude disappearing, long haul frac sand coming back in, I think we’re going to some of that this year as well.
Intermodal if it comes that’s fairly long-haul too, but its slower weight and we talk about the expansion of Delta Port, so right now on the mix side, I’m not too sure exactly where it will go for this year. And there’s a lot of -- we’re not into steady in the environment, we’re into bit of a recovery phase from a volume side, but I think there is reason to be optimistic about volume for this year. I think for the rail industry in general but definitely at CN.
Tom Wadewitz
Okay. Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Tom.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Steve Hansen of Raymond James.
Steve Hansen
Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for time. If I'm looking at the volume growth side of things the strength that appears to be carrying over and Q1 appears quite robust and if I'm looking at the pretty low hurdle in the Q2 given last year’s turmoil, it strikes me that your backend guidance assumptions are probably a little bit conservative or it strikes me that they are conservative. Any thoughts around sort of cadence throughout the year in terms of how the growth will progress in that 3% to 4%?
Ghislain Houle
The first quarter last year, we have tougher winter, so this is really move all the volume we wanted to move, but at time we get to the second quarter we were running very smoothly, but the demand for our product was not that great, you remember that the volume in Q2 wasn’t that great. And then it starts to pickup in the summer time. And our fourth quarter volume, last year it’s been pretty good, so that’s kind of the cycle of what you'll see. But all in, the guidance is volume that we talked about and one we’re sticking to it right now.
Luc Jobin
And Steve, it Luc. Just keep in mind, I mean, if you got better visibility on the second half and we do we’d be more than happy to share notes with you. So at this point I think this is a fair annual guidance and as you indicated, I mean, we do expect to have stronger comps through the first half and then as the year unfold then if we see that the trends are evolving in a way that these are better or worst then we’ll readjust thing, so but…
Ghislain Houle
We are cautious people. I think last year everybody had different guidance. We finished at 3% EPS growth which in the end was one of the best in the industry.
Steve Hansen
I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.
Ghislain Houle
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.

Scott Group
Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, I wanted to go back just the OR question. So, if I just take the pieces of your guidance with volume and price and buyback and earnings, it does imply about a point or so maybe even a point or two OR degradation this year. So is that what you're telling us or maybe is there something conservative in the guidance or maybe something is changing or if you look in the fourth quarter RTMs were up 4% and earnings were up 4%, so maybe something is changing where you just not getting the operating leverage, so how are you kind of answer that, but the guidance does seem to imply OR degradation this year and curious on your thoughts?
Luc Jobin
Yes. Scott, its Luc. Just to give you a little bit more color, I mean, one of the issue that you still have to keep in mind is that we did have a fairly mild winter and when we look at the last year, so that’s not a god-given right and even though people talk about global warming we’re certainly facing more, what I call the more normal winter in fact a little bit more than that if you look to how Decembers came up. In any event, so I think there is a little bit of noise there in terms of where and how the year will unfold from a pure costs standpoint.
And I think again we take a cautious view of sort of the second half in terms of volume. So, the numbers are there and it’s in the zone, so it’s still too early to say whether our OR will determine or not. There isn’t anything that's going on that is particular, it will be again, I mean it will be a question of mix. It will be question of when and how the volume is layered on. Certainly you can expect that will continue to manage the cost very tightly and continue as the mentioned earlier to seize opportunities where we can and we are prepared to invest a little bit more and take on business that maybe at a slightly higher OR, that’s the right thing for the franchise for the long-term.
So I think the precision you’re looking for is not what we do focus on. I mean, what we're doing is we get there, we got a good operating plan, we got a good commercial plan and every time there is an opportunity, we look at it and move on it. So it could be just as much in terms lowering costs, increasing productivity or putting on more business. So you are in the zone, but we’ll have to see how it shakes out.
Scott Group
Okay. And that’s helpful. If I can ask JJ just one clarifying point. So I think you said price was up 2.7% and fuel was down one, but total carload yields were down too, so that implies like a three to four point headwind for mix and carloads and RTMs were pretty similar, so what am I missing on the mix headwind this quarter?
Jean-Jacques Ruest
So on the same-store price it was 2.7% and I want to add, if I remove the regular grain, it was 2.4%, the difference between these two assets, because we do have peak pricing on our grain business that we start October 1st. And what you’re referring to is the impact of the mix. Now we lost, we lost from long-haul business versus the year before and crude by rail has also been shift in our frac sand which is also long haul. The [Indiscernible] business was flat, so there’s a lot of mix noise in our mix result, which impact these revenue ton-mile and these revenue per carload.
But when we’re already managed the business, we don’t manage the business on those matrix, we manage it on same-store price. We manage on revenue to cost ratio, contribution per carload, revenue ROI on equipment and then also we have the impact on exchange and fuel on this revenue ton mile and revenue per carload. So you’re looking at data that in the end is not really that useful to understand our yield. The element that we use and the one I mentioned, the one I listed here.

Scott Group
Okay. Thank you.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from [Indiscernible] of Scotia Bank. Please proceed.
Milan Posarac
Hi, there. This Milan Posarac online for [Tron]. Just wondering CapEx been coming down here last couple of years and you’re guiding for a small decline in 2017 as well, so volume is recovering a bit here in 2017. Should be expect CapEx then to resume its upward trajectory in 2018 or do you think you’ll have a little bit of a longer holiday? Thanks.
Ghislain Houle
Well, this is Ghislain. So absolutely CapEx as I guided was 2.5 versus 2.75 last year. We did say that we had locomotives in 2016 that we were not expecting in 2017, so that helped reduce the envelope, offset a little bit by an uptick on the PTC investments going forward. I think we’ve been very consistent on our investment and capital program. I think we’re always going around 20% of revenues or close to 50% of operating income back to the business. So in my view if I were you I would not assume anything otherwise. I think in that ranges is the range of we’re looking for.
Luc Jobin
Yes. Milan, its Luc. I mean, we obviously are looking whenever we can see opportunities to invest and to further advance our competitive advantage, we’re not shy about doing that. So our eyes in the long-term and as we move forward we have indicated that there may be some opportunities more on the technology side and so we’re looking really hard and we’re not shy about investing. We do have a good track record of delivering returns on capital investments. So that’s of a posture on that.
Milan Posarac
Okay, great. Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter of Merrill. Please proceed.
Ken Hoexter
Great. Good afternoon. Nice job on the quarter and tough weather spike it sounds like, but clearly impacted a punch of peers. For that reason I guess, was there any reason for casualty spike, it was the highest level since the fourth quarter level since 2004, just I guess technical question following on Scott's cost side, but just a longer-term picture that the thoughts our large wins, your big revenue wins with the GM business, Yang Ming. Should we look at this says is the pricing side is as you asked before? Is there a capacity need? What's driving those wins? I’m just wondering, I guess there were large expectation, some of that would move back to your peer, but when you keep winning like this it just wondering, it that just service or is it pricing?
Luc Jobin
So Ken, I think there’s two sides of your question to make sure. So the first one is one casualty and other and the second one is market share. So I’ll tackle the first one. And I’ll let JJ tackle market share. So the first one I explain what happen on in the fourth quarter that explain that variance of $40 million, it’s really an annual throughout that you do with our U.S. legal claims. And about 25 million was another 15 or that was a credit in last year. When you look at casualty and others, sometimes they’re lumpy items that come in a quarter.
If you want to look at a run rate, I think we’ve said in the past that 90 million give or take in a quarter is a good number and that’s what I would use going forward, but sometimes depending on what happens in certain quarters, you might have a lumpy piece hitting like the one that we have on the fourth quarter. JJ you want to talk about the market share, please.
Jean-Jacques Ruest
Yes. So when you look and see accounts like General Motors or [Kia] or Mazda or Yang Ming that they are in the world where service is very key for their own success and I think Mike Cory in his opening comment said it right, our aim to produce a premium service at the lowest operating ratio and that’s supply-chain. So our mindset is to try to put ourselves and issues of this company especially those who are face where in a world where service does matter, automotive and delivering to warehouse and assembly plant and retailers and try to create supply-chain that starts before CN and finished after CN. So we’d become relevant for them.

And that’s how we – customers don't change from one supplier to another without good reason. Everybody obtain which are things are running well, why we’ll make a change, so it starts probably with a some level of dissatisfaction and then looking at something that's more appealing and having little taste of it because we do business with all these people. We were doing business with all of these customers. We’re just going to be doing more of it. And our job is to help them win in their market and that’s the reason why they’d like to little more with CN where are pile of – pile of the extension of their success, so and of course people want to pay a fair market price and having the lowest operating ratio in the industry allow us to compete when we want to.
Ken Hoexter
Very helpful. Appreciate the insight from both. Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Ken.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon of Cormark Securities. Please proceed.
David Vernon
Hello. Two questions please. One is just on headcount, could you give us your thoughts on that. And the second is on tax rate can you give us your thoughts on tax rate for 2017 both effective and the cash stocks?
Mike Cory
Hi, David, it’s Mike here. Look, we modulate our labor based on demand demographics, productivity. We have people still laid off in some crafts. However we were very, very strong planning process and alignment with the variety of functions finance marketing sales operations where we meet regularly and we have a good view of the future and then we modulate our labor like I said.
Luc Jobin
And on the effective tax rate I think we had guided 2016 at 26.5% and I would continue to use that same number for 2017. And on the cash taxes we are still around the mid-teen level, so that’s what I would use.
David Dalman
Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thanks David.
Unidentified Company Representative
Thank you, David.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brian Koenigsberg of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
Brian Koenigsberg
Yes, hi good afternoon. Actually just starting out with the point of clarification, on the revenue ton miles, on the release in the presentation it talks about 4% but if you look at your AAR data, it talks about that actually indicates our camp is up 6.3%. Can you just tell us what the difference is between those two?
Ghislain Houle
So in our press release I think we are using the calendar month, the calendar quarter which is start December start first of October to December 31 and the AR does not use the same period. So this is why in my comment I did refer when I was talking ARR data I was specifically saying that and think because a lot of developed people I see use the ARR data to compare but this is where you get into – it’s not a quarter with 90 days like we have on the ARR. I think Paul could probably explain that in more specific detail after the call ends.
Brian Koenigsberg
Okay, thanks for that. And can you talk a little bit on met coal, I think you indicated to the other customer that was expanding some production, there are possibly some others that could open up business again in 2017 and maybe a little bit more color on that and how significant that could be to the extent these production ramps do happen.
Luc Jobin
In the last quarter of last year, the price of met coal, coking coal started to go up as a result of the Chinese production coming back. We had customers who had lot of energy, who had –was in bankruptcy situation, he had three mines shutdown. All of his assets were bought at a reasonable price by a company called Canuma. It did reopen one of the mine in November. We intend to open another mine sometime in – probably in sometime in the first half. May open a third one, it will all depend how the price of coking oil move around the well. If you have a very good color what the Canuma game plan is, they actually their CEO gave an interview on BNN where he explained all of his game plan how that have come together. But all that to say that coking coal for CN well now should not be a negative headwind, it should be something positive. And that in itself is what I was talking about earlier. All right, thank you Brian.

Brian Koenigsberg
Yeah. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein.
David Vernon
Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess Luc, maybe from a bigger picture sort of strategy perspective as you guys are kind of operating on all cylinders in a decent volume environment. Is there a point we just start looking at other ways to enhance cash flow whether monetization of assets maybe looking at coal production with CP, maybe looking at investing into adjacencies as this. How critical is this for the board and could you give us a sense for what you would think would be sort of fair game for what you could do to supplement the excellent operating results with corporate action?
Luc Jobin
Yeah, I mean thanks for your question. It’s something that we are always looking at. And the first opportunity we look at is opportunities for growth in terms of advancing our book of business and investing in the franchise, so if there are opportunities for some co-investment or helping one of our customers grow and investing along with them we look at these things. In terms of co-production, again there these things are on the radar but they are very few that actually right now that we can look to that might be interesting so I don’t think there is a lot of potential there. We always look at other opportunities whether it’s adjacencies or bolt on smaller rails to acquire.
So those again tend to be a little bit lumpy and we are cautious on adjacencies cause again you need to keep in mind we know what we do very well and unless we think that we can have a competitive advantage or improve our overall product by venturing into these things, we are not presumptuous enough to say that we can do all things well.
In many cases what we’ve done as well is to have alliances in work supply chain and so we don’t necessarily need to own the asset but the way we work with our partners and scorecards and the way we work to improve the performance is clearly has paid off for us. So we look at every opportunity to grow, to continue to grow the franchise. These things are – they are not linear in terms of when and how they come to us, but rest assured we are looking and we are intent on growing this franchise, but in the flip side we are good custodians of the shareholders money and we do look for good returns before we look at acquisitions specially when you are outside of our field of expertise. Okay, thank you…
David Vernon
Is that maybe just as a quick follow up, is there anything material that we should expect on asset monetization for next year or kind of runrate you’ll see how it goes?
Luc Jobin
No, I think from that standpoint Ghislain referred to a little transaction that we were able to achieve by the end of the year. We don’t expect anything of magnitude being out there. Having said that, we are always looking at things and turning stones, so maybe what typically you look at – part of $20 million sort of runrate from miscellaneous parcels and stuff.
Ghislain Houle
Yeah I would say about $20 million and to your point we always strive to find out things and sometimes things unfold in different ways during the year, obviously if we find some on used asset that we can monetize we certainly will run after it but at this point in time I would say that we don’t have anything specific on the docket and I would assume about $20 million of small sales, spread over the year basically.
David Vernon
Very good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.
Cherilyn Radbourne
Thanks very much, good afternoon. So a very strong operating quarter given the winter that you described. A bit of slippage in terms of the train and car velocity I assume a lot of that is winter but if those to the metrics I was also curious whether there were some tradeoffs being made in order to achieve the improvements in train productivity and locomotive utilization you reported, maybe you can just kind of talk a little bit about where you continue to unearth efficiency gains?

Mike Cory
Cherilyn, its Mike here. Winter has obviously had its impact and will continue till it’s over. I said it before it’s really rebalanced all those metrics to produce first of all the service the customers demand and to JJ’s point make sure that we are just not looking at our internal workings, but we look at the entire supply chain and continue to grow that profitable business.
So you’ll see changes throughout the year. We try to make the best decision again to grow the business at the most controlled price and give JJ and the team the opportunity to make sure that we are leading the supply chain. But really you’ll see those numbers fluctuate a little bit. They are certainly not out of the range that they normally are. There is no priority over either of them; it’s just about the demand for the customer.
Cherilyn Radbourne
Great. That’s all from me. Thank you.
Mike Cory
Thank you.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Cherilyn.
Operator
Thank you. The last question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed.
Chris Wetherbee
Hey great thanks and thanks for [squeezing] me in here at the end. A question on frac sand, so I think JJ you mentioned seeing some pick up there, just want to get a sense of kind of how we think about 2017 some of our internal views you were suggesting if you can step up in production just want to get a sense of kind of how you participate and maybe what that means to the mix of the overall business?
Luc Jobin
So the drilling activities is up definitely I think it’s well reported in most part of the continent. In the case of CN we participate in this same way as in the past that we have a destination franchise in Alberta and BC where the drilling activity is also up, example in the month of January. So that’s frac sands coming from [Indiscernible] long haul and we are competing with some local brown sand. And then we also participate in other some shell play where we bring the unit train or into frac sand a Chicago – we interchange with either eastern railroad or western railroad going south.
So it is a good story, it has been sequentially up in the fall, sequentially up in the fourth quarter. We had a good start here to the year. On the Canadian side, the people drill, they love it when it’s cold so they can get in their much – heavy equipment on frozen ground and things don’t be surprised if things on the frac sand start to slow down sometime in the spring they call this during the break up after – the break up or after the when it gets really mushy or muddy and then there is a pause of a couple of weeks and then it restarts again.
So now it’s a positive story. The price of crude and all of the technology of today is a decent outlook for anything which is fracing either for gas or oil.
Chris Wetherbee
All right. That’s helpful.
Luc Jobin
Thank you, Chris.
Luc Jobin
So perhaps in closing to kind of recap, first I need to say I am very proud of what the team has accomplished this year. We certainly demonstrated and state our ability to deliver great results in a very challenging environment. You heard JJ describe how our volume outlook has now turned positive. Mike illustrated for you how the operating team continues to drive our agenda of operational and service excellence in leveraging innovation. Ghislain shared with you our financial performance came together in 2016, its clean and it’s straightforward. And you have received our annual earnings guidance for 2017 which is calling for mid single digit EPS growth. So looking ahead, we set out for 2017 with a constructive view and while the environment remains somewhat mixed, we do expect to see moderate volume growth. Then we’ll see how it unfolds.
One thing for sure, with relentless focus on safety, productivity and service our industry leading team is intent on delivering solid execution. With continued focus on leveraging our superior customer service and our supply chain approach to help us gain traction in the market place. We continue to reinvest in our business with a long term perspective and we are well positioned to deliver a continued share holder value. So on that note we look forward to reviewing our first quarter results with you sometime in April and in the meantime, thank you very much for joining the call and be safe. Thank you, we are ready to close the call. Greta?

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Butcher.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul Butcher, Canadian National Railway Company - Vice-President of IR [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for CN's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to remind you about the comments already made regarding forward-looking statements.With me today is Luc Jobin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; J.J. Ruest, our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; and Ghislain Houle, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. (Operator Instructions) I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions.Read MoreIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Luc Jobin.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. Thanks very much, Paul, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. Well, today, the CN team is pleased to report another very strong quarter. Our performance was driven by a sizable increase in revenues, building on volume momentum which started in the fourth quarter of 2016.Our growth in the second quarter was also broad-based and achieved across most business sectors, translating into an 18% rise in RTMs.Meanwhile, we maintain our inflation-plus pricing discipline. J.J. will give you more color on our record quarterly revenue performance and a sense of what's in store for the second half of the year.From an operating standpoint, Mike and his team worked very hard to accommodate this level of growth while staying true to our commitment to balance service and efficiency. The result is evident in our operating ratio of 55.1%, up only 60 basis points versus last year, and our record operating income in the quarter.Looking at the bottom line. The strength of our quarterly financial results speak for themselves: diluted EPS of $1.36, up 24%; adjusted diluted EPS of $1.34, up 21%; and solid free cash flow generation of $811 million in the quarter. Ghislain will expand on key financial highlights for the second quarter on the call and later today and address as well our outlook for the year.Let me now turn the call over to Mike, who will give you a sense for how the operating team has brought onboard the substantial volume increase we've experienced thus far this year, while maintaining our industry-leading performance. Mike?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Cory, Canadian National Railway Company - COO and Executive Vice-President [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much, Luc. And first, let me just say, happy anniversary to the team here in the room for a very successful first year together.Overall, I'm extremely proud of the operating team's performance in this quarter. It's really a testament to their execution of our operational and service excellence agenda. Our volume growth in this quarter has been the largest in my 36 years at CN, and who would have ever forecasted 175% frac sand increase in 1 quarter. But that's not the entire story. This increase is broad-based across business segments and operating regions.As a result of the volume increase, on top of attrition, we are hiring for all the operating groups, with new skill set demands at the evolution of PTC, technology and automation bring our attention to proper onboarding and integration is greater than I have ever experienced.I'm really proud of what this team has accomplished so far and it's a testament to the culture of excellence that we've created that we're able to manage this type of growth and change environment and produce very solid results. So let's take a look at those results.The volumes of 2016 provided an opportunity to reduce people and assets. Most roads, if not all, saw the benefit of added capacity to more experienced workforces, line and terminal space and less unproductive assets in the mix. Train speed, terminal dwell, fuel and locomotive productivity all improved as a result. So for context, I'm using a similar volume period against the same infrastructure backdrop.Actually, my comparison of 2015 isn't exactly that, as workload or GTMs were 6% less in 2015 than they are in 2017. 2014 is actually a truer comparison workload or GTM wise, but we did make infrastructure improvements in '14 -- excuse me, in '15, so I'm going to use 2015 as an example.The biggest driver of locomotive utilization and car velocity is train speed. With the year-over-year growth, our train speed has declined and affected both of these metrics. However, in comparison to 2015, again, even though volumes were still 6% lower than this year, we improved our velocity while matching both train speed and locomotive utilization. We did this through an aggressive approach to increasing train size, something that we will continue to focus on.On the productivity front, both our yard and train productivity improved over both 2016 and 2015. Our plan to tackle train speed reduction is in place. It includes both innovative approaches as well as improvements that will be made through capacity and safety investments. Our focus on efficiency and reliability will never wane, with a longer-term plan to fundamentally change operations through technology, automation and optimization. The introduction of new operational and service systems will provide the opportunity for our customers to grow their markets efficiently.On the safety front, we continue to build a greater understanding of risk awareness within our team. We're capitalizing on our strong relationship with our operating unions to ensure everyone genuinely looks out for each other. Our FRA accident ratio did increase from 1.57 to 1.61 on a year-over-year comparable. While both those numbers are a continuous improvement over the last 5-year run rate, our accident costs this quarter, while in line with previous year's run rates, were higher than in 2016.For injuries, we're slightly up over our ratio for last year. Comparing to the last 5-year run rate, though, we continue to improve on the absolute number. However, productivity improvements that reduce human work hours have affected the ratio.To all of us, this slip is just not acceptable. And regardless of volume increase and mix of employee experience, we know that our most valuable asset is our people, and we will correct this.Overall, we're working very hard to improve our safety record, and I have a number of initiatives headed up by a newly developed and integrated team.So overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the quarter. With the volume growth, we definitely had challenging conditions to deliver these results. It's clear the team came through once again, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to lead them.With that, over to you, J.J.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Mike, and great job on moving all those crates. Today, I will keep my comments to 3 high-level topics. I will start with a high-level description of how we achieved success in the last quarter, followed by last quarter major variance, and I will close with recent progress on our commercial agenda.So let's start with how we achieved success in the last quarter. First, we outperformed the economy. Our revenue was up $487 million or 17% above last year. Year-to-date, our revenue was up almost $750 million or 13% above last year, more precisely, $729 million.We also outperformed the rail industry. CN's AAR carloads were up 14.5% versus the industry average of 6.7% in Q2. Year-to-date, our carloads were up 11.8% above last year versus the industry average of 4.6%.Also very important to us is to achieve broad-based diversified source of growth. And to that point, all of our business unit produced good growth this quarter. On top of that, 3 segment have had all-time record -- company record, namely, international containers, automotive finished vehicle and frac sand for oil and gas drilling.Finally, we generated same-store price above rail inflation at 2.3% for the quarter and 2.5% for year-to-date.I will now highlight selected segments that produced the most variants.Frac sand, as Mike mentioned, was up 175%. Total Canadian grain carloads were up 23%. Container volume from Vancouver South Shore Vanterm and Centerm terminal were up a combined 135%. Potash carloads were up almost 20%. Automotive carloads were up 9%. It is worth noting, CN handle about 75% of all the finished vehicle sold in Canada. Coal carloads were down 3%, but revenue was up a solid 33% because of business mix.The Port of Montreal and Halifax volume, when combined, were up 10%. Our volume for natural gas liquid, plastic pellets and condensates were down.The Canadian dollar and our fuel surcharge program versus last year were both positive tailwind to our reported revenues, respectively, $85 million for FX, $62 million for the fuel.Now I will highlight recent progress of our commercial agenda. The new customers that we onboarded earlier this year are delivering solid growth. The Port of Prince Rupert created an all-time high rail volume in June, a good omen for the upcoming 3 years. Sand product of Blair, Wisconsin opened a new frac sand mine on CN, and we expect another of our sand customers, Wisconsin propane company of Hixton, Wisconsin, to further increase production on CN as well.Crude volume bounced back from last year's Fort McMurray fire, but the last Eastern Canada refinery that was using crude-by-rail will stop doing so sometime in late August.Whirlpool announced they will build a regional distribution center in our Calgary Logistics Park, which further progress our co-location strategy with distribution centers in intermodal. But our strategy also applies to grain, where we have a number of grain country elevators, either as newbuild or expansion of existing elevators, to be done by Viterra, Cargill, GrainsConnect, G3, P&H, ILTA. And the same co-location strategy also apply to export transload. We have Ray-Mont Logistics, who are building a major grain transfer facility in Rupert for the summer.CMA, the ocean shipping line, will start a new service on the East Coast at the Port of Saint John, New Brunswick, further building our 3 coast strategic advantage. And the case for the Port of St. John, our strategic focus is on ocean container, on coal supply chain business and on bulk export of potash.The new Duluth, Minnesota container terminal is now in operation, and we are also finalizing plan to have a container terminal service in Regina by the 2018 grain crop. This is further advancing our overall strategy of increasing our geographic reach by adding new and more destination.And last but not least, our technology business team, which is now fully staffed, is in full project development mode to digitize CN next generation of supply chain services and build a foundation of our future competitive edge.In conclusion, to wrap this up, we had a good, diversified quarter, with a number of good business unit coming through with good result. The economic outlook for Q3 look constructive and we're on track to the full year volume guidance.Ghislain, do you want to pick it up from here?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, J.J. Starting on Page 11 of the presentation, I will summarize the key financial highlights of our solid second quarter performance. As J.J. previously pointed out, revenues for the quarter were up 17% versus last year at slightly over $3.3 billion.Fuel lag on a year-over-year basis represented a revenue tailwind of $20 million or $0.02 of EPS, mostly driven by an unfavorable lag in the second quarter of 2016 of the same amount.Operating income was slightly under $1.5 billion, up $202 million or 16% versus last year. Our operating ratio came in at 55.1% or 60 basis point higher than last year. Fuel prices had no impact on the increase this quarter.Net income stood at $1,031,000,000, or 20% higher than last year, with reported diluted earnings per share of $1.36.Adjusted EPS was up 21% to $1.34 from a year earlier EPS of $1.11, excluding the impact on deferred income tax expense from the enactments of changes in provincial income tax rates in both years.The impact of foreign currency was $28 million favorable on net income, or $0.04 of EPS in the quarter.Turning to expenses on Page 12. As Mike previously pointed out, we continue to make progress in the quarter in terms of efficiency gains, including disciplined cost management initiatives, despite a significant increase in volumes. Our operating expenses were up 18% versus last year at just over $1.8 billion, mostly driven by stronger volumes and higher incident costs. Expressed on a constant currency basis, this represents a 16% increase.At this point, I will refer to the variances in constant currency.Labor and fringe benefit expenses were $527 million or 10% higher than last year, as increased wages and incentive compensation expenses were partially offset by higher capital credits. On a full year basis, we still expect pension expense to be roughly flat versus last year.Purchase services and material expenses were $432 million or 12% higher than last year. This was mostly the result of higher outsource services and repair and maintenance costs, mostly driven by higher volumes.Fuel expense stood at $329 million or 30% higher than last year. Higher volumes accounted for a $37 million increase and price was an unfavorable variance of $27 million versus 2016. Fuel productivity was about 1% improvement in the quarter versus last year.Depreciation stood at $326 million or 8% higher than last year, mostly as a result of net asset additions.Equipment rents were up 8% versus last year driven by increased car hire, partly offset by lower lease expense. Casualty and other costs were $117 million, which was $42 million higher than last year, mostly driven by higher incident cost of $21 million and an increase in environmental provision of $7 million.For the balance of the year, we can expect about $90 million to $100 million per quarter for casualty and others.Moving to cash on Page 13. We generated free cash flow of $1,659,000,000 through the end of June. This is $490 million higher than in 2016 and mostly the result of higher cash generated from operating activities, lower capital expenditures and lower cash taxes.Finally, our 2017 financial outlook on Page 14. We achieved solid volumes in the first half of the year, reflecting strong performance across most segments. We continue to see favorable economic conditions in North America, including a stronger than expected Canadian economy. In addition, consumer confidence remains positive, while a strong energy sector is driving shipments of frac sand and steel pipes.Crude volumes are strong, but this remains a spot business. However, we expect volume growth in the second half of the year to be more challenged, as comparables with 2016 will be more difficult, particularly in the fourth quarter. We believe this environment should continue to translate into volume growth of approximately 10% in terms of RTMs for the full year versus 2016, with overall pricing remaining above inflation.We have experienced -- we had recently experienced the strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. And assuming the current spot rate of around $0.80, this will create a headwind on earnings going forward.As a reference, $0.01 appreciation in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar results in an annual headwind on net income of approximately $30 million or $0.04 of EPS.Despite the dollar headwind, we are reaffirming our guidance and continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.95 to $5.10 versus 2016 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.59. In fact, should foreign exchange remain at $0.80, we could finish at the upper range -- at the upper end of our range.On the capital front, we remain committed to reinvesting in our business to support safety, service and growth. In this regard, we continue to target a capital envelope of $2.6 billion for the year and about 20% of revenues going forward.Furthermore, we continue to reward our shareholders with consistent dividend returns, and we are on track with our current share buyback program of approximately $2 billion, having repurchased just over 14 million shares for $1.3 billion since last October.In closing, we remain committed to our agenda and continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value today and for the long term.On this note, back to you, Luc.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. Thank you, Ghislain. So in closing, let me add a few words. Looking ahead, we hold a positive view of the economic environment, and we expect to have volume growth in the second half, although we will be facing some tougher comps versus last year.Our strategy of leveraging CN's superior supply chain approach to grow faster than the underlying markets continues to bear fruits, and J.J. highlighted a number of opportunities for us on the way forward. Mike and our operating team are energized, and all hands are on deck to balance operational and service excellence. Our focus remains on delivering value for our customers and, ultimately, for our shareholders.In spite of a stronger Canadian dollar, as Ghislain confirmed, that we're also on track to deliver against our yearly outlook, both in terms of earnings and reinvesting in our franchise.So on that note, we're happy to now take your questions. And we'll turn the call back over to you, Patrick.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A couple of questions, if I can squeeze it in. One is on pricing. Clearly, there's an industry-wide issue, but -- and you guys saw a sequential price deceleration, like everybody else, but can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of this? And as inflation increase in the second half, what could be your sources of price gains?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ravi, it's J.J. So at 2.3%, I believe that we are in the range of our industry. We're also in the range of the first quarter. On the grain side, we do seasonal pricing, so we don't take the grain cap and spread over 12 months. We apply for that price increase when the demand is strongest and take it away when the demand is least. But at 2.3%, I think, we are meeting our objective of same-store price above rail inflation. Rail inflation is below that at this point. And I think...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And as it increases in -- sorry, go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And I think, to work forward, that's the range that we're in as an industry.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Fadi Chamoun from BMO Capital Markets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fadi Chamoun, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD and Analyst [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So J.J., just a question on the crude-by-rail, which seems like it could be a significant opportunity for you guys going into 2018, and maybe even at the end of this year. Can you give us your thought on this? Have you had any discussion with a producer, what this opportunity might look like and sort of potential timing of that ramp-up?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, I think, Fadi, I like one of your headline from one of your report where you say crude-by-rail opportunity interesting, but not yet exciting. Meaning, there's not yet huge capacity shortage of the pipeline capacity. So production is ramping up. Depending on who you talk to, it may be later this year or early this year, but production exceed pipeline capacity, at which time, there would be a window for crude-by-rail to move product from Alberta to wherever the consumer within North America. But at this point, it's not part really of a base case that we expect a lot of crude-by-rail pick up in 2017 anyway. But if there is, we do have the network and the locomotive power to do that, so we are in position to be able to do that. And if ever the Canadian grain crop is a little less than the average, that crude-by-rail would be a nice way to fill up the second and third quarter of 2018. At this point, it's a whole car that's -- we have to wait for the pipeline industry to be tight.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Walter Spracklin from RBC.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Walter Noel Spracklin, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So I guess, my -- I want to focus here on grain and the outlook here. I know most of your levers are pretty low on the Prairies right now. So my question is, how do you look at the -- your forecast versus a fairly significant comp from last year? How should we be modeling an average crop or the risk that it goes below average? And do you expect that to be aggravated by any share loss relative to a fairly strong share gain you had last year? So could you talk whether you think you're going to lose a little bit of share next year temporarily, if anything? And what the impact downside could be if we don't get any rain in the Prairies here in the near-term?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So if we take the usual half end of the year, it's J.J., in the third quarter, what really matter is how early is the crop? Is it coming -- is it harvested in early September, so we can move in September? Or was it coming in quite late where it's too late for the third quarter? When you get to the fourth quarter, every year, Mike's team railroad very hard because we know the crop is super big, well, less than average, everybody wants to sell grain in the fourth quarter, so we run flat out. Typically, the same thing in winter time. So the size of the crop is really a second and third quarter 2018 question, and that's really, I think, it's too early to tell. We will know by the time we have the third quarter result in late -- mid-October, we will know how big is that crop and then we'll know the story for 2018. In terms of share, I would advise that people not to bet against us. We're pretty competitive when it comes to the marketplace.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We -- let's just say, Walter, that we don't plan on losing share, so -- and the rest for us is all upside and when we're focused on growing the business, so we'll see how things unfold.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Tom Wadewitz from UBS.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thomas Richard Wadewitz, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just wanted to see if you had -- I guess, we've heard from CSX and they've talked about some people from another organization that knows about precision railroading, that some operational talent has come over to them. It's not really clear what level or whether that's from -- directly from you or former CN people. But I just wanted to see if you could comment on whether there are concerns about any kind of operational managers leaving and whether that's something you see at this point?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Cory, Canadian National Railway Company - COO and Executive Vice-President [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tom, it's Mike here. Look, we've lost a few frontline supervisors. So really, the effect is small. And just so everybody's clear, my job, my team's job is to continue to teach, coach, develop people so that we can look down the bench and always have the right amount and the right type of people in line. And right now, I look down the bench and I'm extremely comfortable. So it's a compliment for others to come and emulate our approach and we'll continue to develop people and go forward, but no issue on our part.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thomas Richard Wadewitz, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Is there a way to kind of frame the magnitude of it? Like -- and it doesn't sound like something you're concerned about, but is there a way to say, out of how many people out of that level of -- is it 2 out of 30 people at that level or any way to kind of gauge it?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Cory, Canadian National Railway Company - COO and Executive Vice-President [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I guess I'd use the word not -- the words "not significant."--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cherilyn Radbourne, TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted to give J.J. a bit of a break by asking Mike a question. Obviously, continued strong performance in accommodating the volume growth that you've had. And I think most of us in the call would have some familiarity with how mix can impact metrics like revenue per carload or revenue per RTM, but I just wondered if you could speak in a bit more detail about how you look at those 6 key operating metrics and assess them internally in light of volume growth and mix to assess how well you've done?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Cory, Canadian National Railway Company - COO and Executive Vice-President [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, Cherilyn. Really, it's been a little bit difficult of a year in terms of trying to compare it to a previous, especially 2016. With the volume growth itself, the key components here that we -- where we look at, train speed, car velocity, locomotive productivity, locomotive utilization, those things are going to have an impact from that much of a volume growth. We've identified clearly areas that we've got to get closer in and diagnose the issue in terms of the train speed. We've identified some pinch points. But really, we'll do the same thing we always do, that's use an integrated team approach, use all the resources we have and really look at the existing plan and infrastructure and go from there. You can -- in terms of just pure productivity, our focus is on trainload, on how we handle cars and cost to put them through yards, whether it be an intermodal yard, or whether it be a switching yard. Those things never change, and that's something that's always right, front and center of us, if that helps answer any questions you have.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott H. Group, Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior Transportation Analyst [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So I don't know if this is for Luc or Ghislain. I just want to ask more broadly kind of the way the model is working. So it's the second quarter in a row where revenue growth outpaced operating income growth. And is there, in your mind, something unusual in the past 2 quarters just given either something on the cost side or just the magnitude of the revenue growth? Or is this how you -- maybe we should think about the model going forward and maybe more as we kind of look to the back half of the year when revenue and volume growth decelerate into tougher comps, should we still think about operating income growth growing slower than revenue growth? Or do you think we should go back to maybe the normal way of thinking about rails where you see some operating leverage and operating income growth exceeds revenue growth? I know, a long question, but hopefully, you...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott, thanks for the questions. It's Luc. Listen, we don't think that there's any significant change. It's really a question of mix and how much business is coming onboard. In addition to that, there are occasionally one-time items that can cloud a little bit the analysis. So we still think that the historical model does work. From time to time, what will happen is you're bringing onboard a significant amount of volume. So in that sense, your incremental margin is now going to be even and progressive. So I think that's a little bit of what we've seen. But if you take a step back and look at the first half of the year, our incremental margin is probably sitting around 50% or something like that. And when we look at the back half of the year, Mike is in a good position to continue to improve on the operating metrics, and we feel pretty good that we can see potentially a little bit more operational leverage kicking in. So -- and the nature of -- the mix and the nature of what we're bringing on, a lot of it has been long haul business, unit train, and in many cases, customer cars. So that also will tend to create some noise in terms of if you're looking at the revenue yield versus the operating profit yield. But we feel comfortable that there is no fundamental change in the model and the way we look at the balance of the year and the way forward.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And Scott, this is Ghislain. I would also say that, as in my remarks, that we had a little bit of a spike up on a year-over-year basis on incident costs by about $21 million. So again, that is reflected in the numbers. But to emphasize Luc's point, I think the model is working.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Turan Quettawala from Scotiabank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Go ahead, Turan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Turan Quettawala, Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Transportation and Aerospace, Equity Research [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sorry, I was on mute. So I guess, my question was on the fuel lag here. I was just wondering if you could talk about whether that started to benefit you at all at the end of the quarter and maybe if there's something that could benefit you in Q3? And is it going to be enough potentially at current prices to offset some of the FX impact?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Turan, this is Ghislain. So as I mentioned in my remarks, fuel lag helped us by $20 million or $0.02 in the second quarter. And that in the third quarter, very, very small. I would say, we're looking possibly at a positive lag at this year of about $10 million. So -- and there was nothing last year. So on a year-over-year basis, you could be talking about $0.01 in the third quarter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kenneth Scott Hoexter, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Co-Head of the Industrials [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can you just maybe, J.J., talk a little bit more about intermodal. I think, you mentioned a new Regina container program for grain. Are you focusing converting bulk traffic over and away from the highway? And maybe talk a little bit about the benefits of the tightening U.S. truck market, if you're seeing that on growth opportunity yet.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So the initiative in Regina has to do with balancing the extension we have at Prince Rupert and at Deltaport to offer the shipping line a revenue that makes sense for them. We need to offer them not only just a good destination but also some revenue on the way back. And in Southern Saskatchewan, there's just big growth on the specialty crop. Most of them are sold overseas; a lot of them are sold in containers. So 2 products we're going to be offering in order to do that. One is this summer. Ray-Mont Logistics will have its transport facility completed by the month of August in Rupert. They will be able to receive full unit train of specialty crop from anywhere in the Prairies of the U.S., to loading container at the port itself. And then, by the summer of 2018, we will be able also to receive loader container or specialty crop to be loaded in Regina, which is much closer to where the products are being grown. Regarding the question on trucking, I guess it's almost like a capacity and price question. We're not really seeing yet the tightening of the marketplace within the highway, at least on what we do, which is mostly repeat contract business, not spot business. That's actually driving price yet on domestic intermodal. So at this point, that's, I guess, it's something to come, but not there at this point. If that helps, I can...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kenneth Scott Hoexter, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Co-Head of the Industrials [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, it does.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Steve Hansen from Raymond James.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Steven P. Hansen, Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - SVP [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My question is on coal specifically. We've seen a pretty significant mix shift of late that, I think, you described in your remarks. I'm just curious about your outlook here, the met side in particular and some of the traffic that's coming out of the northeast part of British Columbia, and what we should expect into the balance of the year and next year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Steve. So the Canadian coal that we moved to the West Coast is mostly met coal, some thermal coal but also met coal. We also do quite a bit of petroleum coke from Northern Alberta, which is also in our coal result; pet coke is mixed in our coal result. So those business, whether it's pet coke from Fort McMurray, or Canadian coal from Canadian coal mine in B.C. and Alberta, I would describe them as steady. So now, we're at a cruising phase, and the sequential volume will probably stay at this. When it comes to U.S. coal, it's one of our question mark for the fourth quarter. So why we're not sure yet how much growth we will get in the fourth quarter in total is related to U.S. coal, is related to U.S. grain and how that will pan out because the U.S. crop doesn't look fantastic. And the crop in South America looks great. They have a lot of product, and we don't know if we were going to be competing to move corn and soy beans to the Gulf by unit train, or will a lot of that will end up moving by barges on the Mississippi since the Mississippi barge rate are quite low.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Brandon Robert Oglenski, Barclays PLC, Research Division - VP and Senior Equity Analyst [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I guess, I want to revisit Scott's question maybe in a different way. When we were at the Analyst Day last month, you guys focused a lot on the intermodal opportunity. So I guess, just thinking into next year, if you're going to see mix more from intermodal outgrowing rest of the business, could this be a potential source of margin headwind as we would think about, especially with the Canadian dollar strengthening? And could be 2018 maybe a continuation of the themes we've seen in '17?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for the question, Brandon. It's Luc. Listen, again, we don't really see that as taking shape. We've always said that the margin on the intermodal business is on the average for the book of business. So in that sense, we don't see a significant shift. And again, we've got the structure to actually take on the volume, so we don't foresee a significant change.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from David Vernon from Bernstein.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Scott Vernon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc, I wanted to kind of hit a little bit on the same topic. It does look to me like the incrementals, if you strip out the favorable benefit of the pension and even a little bit of the currency, you're running closer to 20%, and yet, your volume growth is running at the high end that we've seen over the last 10 years. What is it that's taking away the normal volume-driven leverage we would expect to see? I mean, if you're getting price above inflation, this kind of volume-driven leverage, I would've just sort of expected a better operating income result.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, David, let me take a step back and kind of walk you through this a little bit because this is a question that's come up a couple of times, and I think we want to make sure people get a clear sense of what's going on. A lot of the growth that we've had is actually been very much long-haul business around coal, around...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Potash, frac sand.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Potash and frac sand, and so on and so forth. So it's very good growth but it's long haul. It's also, as I mentioned earlier, customer equipment. So when you look at the revenue, what you're going to get is you're going to get a lower revenue yield. So that's not a factor of weak pricing. That is a factor of the revenue we charge for the book and haul business, and a lot of it is unit train as well. So that is -- we have to disassociate that from the cost structure because the cost structure for moving that business is, in fact, lower. You don't have to pay for the car supply, and we do have a very good margin on that business. So in effect, if you look at what's happening in terms of the operating ratio and leave aside some of the noise which Ghislain referred to, which may happen from one quarter to the next, in some cases, you've got FX, you've got fuel, then you've got some of the casualty costs that can distort a little bit your quarterly numbers. But on the whole, as I mentioned earlier, when you look at the first half of the year and our incremental OR is 50%. So we were not seeing a shift away from profitability. What happens is the mix and the nature of the business we're picking up is leading to very strong GTMs and RTMs and -- but the revenue profile is different. So I think that is something that certainly was present in the first half of the year. Probably, we're not going to see as much of that in the second half, but there will be some. So you kind of have to work your way through the nature and the mix of business, and you have to look at other metrics, not just your revenue yield, to assess the quality of what we're bringing onboard in terms of growth as well as our efficiency numbers. So when Mike looked at some of the operational productivity numbers, again, they're solid when you compare against similar work levels and volume levels back to 2015. So when you look at all of the other measures, you should gain some comfort that there isn't something going on here where we're bringing on what I would describe as low-quality growth. That's not the case. And I mean, again, the team is very much focused and very -- we want to bring in good business onboard, but we also -- as I said, it can be lumpy. So in this quarter, we picked up a lot of business, and so did we in the first quarter. And the team -- the first mission for the team is bring it on, make sure that the levels of service are good and then we kind of look at grinding it out. So we're constantly looking for opportunities where we can not only lower the cost of servicing the business, but as a matter of fact, how can we enhance the service levels? So you will see that taking place. And that is why I think, longer term, we don't feel that we turn -- we have to turn business away. We have confidence that we can do it. We don't -- and J.J. showed you what the pricing levels are. So we're very thoughtful in pricing the business and attracting good business and then working it through to maintain the profitability levels that have made us the leading Class 1 in the space. So all that to say, we feel pretty good about where we are and we'll continue to crank out these numbers on the way forward. And probably, you'll see a little bit less of this pattern, but it will -- there will still be some, certainly, in the second half of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Scott Vernon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that. As you think about grinding up, is that a question of rewriting the contracts, or is it a question of maybe just getting it more ingrained in the operation and catching up a little bit on the productivity side?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, it's not rewriting the contract, trust me. It's the innovation. It's pushing the envelope. I mean, this is what Mike and his team excel at doing day in and day out. So it really is looking at where and how can we improve, as I said, on the 2 key dimensions that we always focus on, efficiency and service. And we -- the team's mission and the team's mandate is not to achieve one at the expense of the other. So that's what you have to look at, and keep your eyes on the team. That's what they do best.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Christian F. Wetherbee, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted to talk a little bit about the volume cadence in the back half of the year. So I think you've had a couple of comments about some of the things that could be variables, particularly to the fourth quarter. But when you look at the RTM guide and your progress so far, I guess I'm just curious, what is the risk to the fourth quarter in terms of actually seeing negative RTMs and maybe what are some of those major variables. I'm guessing grain, and I think you mentioned U.S. coal could also be part of it, but I just wanted to get a sense maybe with some more detail about what some of those moving parts could be in 4Q?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [48]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chris, it's J.J. When we get to the fourth quarter, one of the thing we're unsure of at this point, one is U.S. coal, U.S. grain, the crop, but also whether they move on the long-haul railroad or short-haul railroad. Sulfur is also a question mark for us, either liquid or going to the U.S. or dry going to the coast. So it's really typically on the bulk side. And potash, Uralkali and Canpotex have both settled their contract with the Chinese, which means now that all contracts will be settled for all other countries. But we don't know whether or not we will have the same record potash moved that we did last year in the fourth quarter, which was very strong. And by the way, that's an example of where Mike has rewritten how we do business. When we move these potash trains from Saskatchewan to St. John, we now move them in 205 cars. Nobody moves train of 205 cars in North America. So obviously, your cost per unit is down. That's how we can compete on a lower cent per RTM and make money despite of that. So the fourth quarter question mark is more about the bulk side and whether or not we will have below last year or surprise ourselves and be as good or maybe better than last year. We feel more confident about the rest of the economy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Christian F. Wetherbee, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP [49]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------But as it stands, you got positive RTMs into your model for the fourth quarter?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [50]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, some. And then, the place in the model where we have negative RTM is bulk-related and the uncertainty of other commodity, which I talked about.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [51]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And clearly, Chris, I mean, it is tapering down. There's no question about that. But we don't -- as J.J. pointed out, we don't see negative RTM growth, but there is a tightening up that will take place in the fourth quarter. So far, the third quarter is looking good.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, first 3 weeks is pretty good.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So we'll have to walk it home.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [54]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Konark Gupta from Macquarie Capital Markets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Konark Gupta, Macquarie Research - Analyst [55]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just a question on metals and minerals. I guess, frac sand, iron ore and steel have driven the segment so far this year. So where do you see trends in those commodities in the second half in 2018? Is there any stickiness basically in the existing frac sand business if growth and drilling activity slows down more materially?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [56]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, it's J.J. So yes, there is stickiness in the frac sand business. We foresee frac sand sequentially stay at the rate where it is right now. They'll eventually [relap], but we have very strong second quarter in frac sand, and if it sequentially maintain that rate, it's very positive. When you look at the CN M&M, metals and minerals category, where you have frac sand into that, you have steel, you have mineral, you also have iron ore, but the one that really is driving this category year-to-date is the frac sand, and we believe the frac sand will hold.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [57]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Benoit Poirier from Desjardins Capital Markets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Benoit Poirier, Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP and Industrials, Transportation, Aerospace, Industrial Products & Special Situation Analyst [58]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------J.J., a lot of color about the currency impact on translation and also on the EPS, but when you talk to customers, I was wondering if you could point out the strength of the Canadian dollar, whether you see some potential impact on some commodities and whether it makes the Canadian ports losing some of their competitive advantage? So talking about grain, coal, forest product, whether it could impact some volume in the longer term?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [59]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, thank you very much. So it's still early on. It's what, a couple of cents, maybe up to $0.05, I don't know if the Canadian dollar will go up from this point or stay where it is. No, I don't think -- we don't have customers at this point where those $0.04, $0.05 is going to have a material impact on their sales to the United States or sales abroad. Now frankly, at $0.70, $0.72, Canadian dollar is quite weak, too. So one would not think the Canadian economy has to rely on such a weak dollar. I think, at this point, I mean, this is not a huge change, a couple of cents, from the point of view of our customers and their production costs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [60]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Brian Patrick Ossenbeck, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst [61]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So Ghislain, going back to the Investor Day, you said the cost of train control would increase and it wouldn't be a small number. So Mike mentioned hiring some people for technology and PTC. Where does the OpEx and G&A stand related to that system right now? And where do you expect that to settle out when everything's online, call it, 2018 first half, subdivision is done in 2020, when everything is wrapped up?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [62]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Thanks, Brian. When you look at PTC this year, I think what we're looking at is possibly about $120 million. 1/3 of that would be depreciation. And in terms of the future years, I think we're not going to provide guidance for the future years. I think we're very focused and the team is very focused on delivering. And we're in the thick of it and we're advancing, so it's good. And we'll see. And frankly, we need to deliver PTC first before we know, once we're there, how much it's going to cost us to support it. But we know this year that it will be $120 million. 1/3 of it is depreciation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [63]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Justin Long from Stephens.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Justin Trennon Long, Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD [64]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know it may be a little bit early for this question, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts or expectations on this year's peak season, just given some of your port capacity expansion projects. I thought you might have an early read. So I'm curious what you're expecting and what's baked into your guidance for the back half of the year?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [65]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Justin, it's J.J. I think for us, for this year, especially this year, the fact that Rupert's capacity should be available to all of us by late August in Deltaport, sometime in the fall, might be more relevant than the fall peak itself, because now we have the ability to access a lot of capacity. And the question will be whether or not CN, (inaudible) and GCT collectively would have been able to sell some of that as early as August, September, October, November. So we are planning for significant growth in, obviously, intermodal related to fall peak, but more about the capacity available to us now that premarketing that we did about the service that we collectively offer, including the service that we have on the south shore of Vancouver, which already has huge -- been a huge help to us in the last 6 months.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Justin Trennon Long, Stephens Inc., Research Division - MD [66]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Great. But maybe to just follow up, as you strip out the capacity additions that you have planned, does it feel like the underlying demand environment as it relates to peak will improve this year relative to last year?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [67]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wouldn't say so. No, I don't think the peak this year will be of a different trend or bigger than last year. But the Canadian economy right now is doing fairly good. So I mean, the consumption by the Canadian consumers and the U.S. Midwest and U.S. mid-American consumers seems to be solid and good. And obviously, we've benefited from that as well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [68]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from Allison Landry from Crédit Suisse.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Allison M. Landry, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director [69]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thinking about the guidance for the 10% RTM growth, it's basically implying a full year number, which is, I guess, slightly above the peak that you saw in 2014. So are you at the point where you're basically really needing to think about ramping up resources? And is it fair to say that you're potentially approaching capacity levels? Mix, I know, is a factor, but any way you can help us think through this would be helpful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [70]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, Allison, this is Ghislain. From a resource standpoint, we do and we are hiring. I mean, if you look at the end of Q4 2016 versus the end of Q1 '17, we added about 300 people. And our labor productivity in terms of million GTMs per employee was up 14%. When you look at the end of Q2 versus the end of Q1, we've added another 540 people, and again, our employee productivity was up 14%. So we are adding people. We said we were going to do that, and we have to do that a little bit in advance because there is a lead time to train these folks, whether it's our crews or whether it's engineering or mechanical folks. So we're trying to be ahead of the game. But obviously, as you can see from these statistics, we are not adding one for one. So we are absorbing. And then, I'll ask Mike to settle in on capacity. Mike and I and J.J. are connected very close at the hip. We're looking at volumes coming. We're always working together to see potential pinch points, where they are, and we want to be ahead of the game. We want to be investing before it happens, but we don't want to do that too early either. So we are currently investing to support our intermodal business. We are investing to support our growth in frac sand. From a capacity standpoint, we will continue to look at this and do that next year. So I think that it's a lot of volume coming at us, so we're pleased about the work that we've done. We're pleased about the fact that we've been able to absorb, and we'll continue to absorb some of that volume, and we're pleased about the fact that we're trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of our investment.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael A. Cory, Canadian National Railway Company - COO and Executive Vice-President [71]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I can't add a whole lot since Ghislain said most, but I'll refer to what Luc was talking about. Allison, we really -- we clearly diagnose whatever the issue may be that's creating what we might see to be a pinch point. And before we spend, we look internally, whether it's infrastructure we already have, whether it's some innovative way to approach it, but that's been our template for a long time, and that will continue. But to Ghislain's point, we know the areas that we've seen extreme growth. We know the areas that we've seen train speed drop to a degree. We definitely come together as a group and we've identified a lot of things we're going to do, and we'll see where that takes us and we'll do what we have to do in order to service the customer the way they expect and need and the way we need to keep the cost down.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [72]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And Allison, just to put icing on the cake here, you're getting all 3 for 1. I would say -- it's Luc. I would say that what we constantly do is we triage and we prioritize where we see the most leverage and the most opportunities for deploying capital. So that is always what we've talked about is within the scope of our capital envelope. And what we do is we prioritize depending on where and how we see the opportunities. So you shouldn't expect a significant shift in the profile of our CapEx over time. It should be in line with what we've described at the Investor Day.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [73]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The next question is from David Tyerman from Cormark Securities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Bruce Tyerman, Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst of Institutional Equity Research [74]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So just following up on the comments on hiring. So should we expect hiring to continue at 300 to 500 people additional, or does it slow down quite a bit as the volume growth slows down?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luc Jobin, Canadian National Railway Company - CEO, President and Director [75]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Listen, I think I'm not going to give you, David, a specific number of what we're going to do, is continue to -- we will hire. We're looking at what's ahead of us, but we'll not hire one for one. So that's the key, and we're going to continue to absorb some of that volume with the service and the operations that we have. So...All right. Well, thank you for the questions. Obviously, we're very pleased and we're very proud of our second quarter results. I think they continue to support what we have been doing for several years in terms of advancing our strategy and gaining traction in the marketplace. And we continue to see future growth ahead of what the base markets can bring to us. We've got a lot of good initiatives going on. Our offering in the marketplace is resonating with customers. So we feel good about our ability to attract, retain and work through -- efficiently work through the business that we're bringing onboard. So a good quarter, a very good quarter, actually, when you look at these numbers. And I think the year is shaping very well. And again, we're restating our guidance and we're staying, in spite of some of the changes in currencies and other little headwinds, we're staying the course. So we're looking forward to bringing you up to date when we have our third quarter call. And in the meantime, thank you for joining in and we'll see you later.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-Jacques Ruest, Canadian National Railway Company - CMO and Executive Vice-President [76]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway Company - CFO and EVP [77]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you.
