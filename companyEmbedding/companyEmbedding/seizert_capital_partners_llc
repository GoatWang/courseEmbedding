SCP Philosophy


We believe that short-term market fluctuations can create long-term investment oppotunities that can be systematically identified. 







 



														1													

Investment
Factors
Three anomalies — Valuation, Quality, and Market Reaction—have historically outperformed the market over long time periods




 



														2													

Margin
of Safety
The difference between the stock price and its estimated value is the margin of safety, which can minimize the risk of loss




 



														3													

Ownership
Mentality
An investment is an ownership stake in the underlying business




 



														4													

Concentration
of Capital
High conviction investments maximize the probability of compounding capital over the long term

Process | Seizert Capital Partners













































Request More Information











Process


















Step 1Identify



Rank the investment universe to generate a list of stocks that are attractive on a relative basis within each sector.










SCP utilizes a weekly report appraising various quantitative factors, providing a ranked list of companies within each sector. Portfolio Managers use the ranking system to narrow the field of candidates without excluding any companies from consideration. The ranking system provides a consistent set of metrics to analyze how the companies may rank over time.
Factors used to calculate ranking include, but are not limited to:

Valuation

Price to Free Cash Flow
Price to Earnings
Price to Book
Price to Sales
Enterprise Value to EBITDA
Dividend Yield



Quality

Return Metrics
Margins
Analysis of Accruals
Capital Structure
Capital Allocation
CAPEX to Depreciation
Net Income to CFFO
Risk Indicators



Market Reaction

Stock Price Trend
Consensus Estimates
Estimate Revisions
Liquidity







Step 2Analyze



Fundamental research seeks four tenets of quality.










Our investment team conducts comprehensive fundamental analysis to evaluate each company’s core competencies,  financial strength, competitive advantages, and management behaviors.
Stable and understandable business model

Understandable business
Predictable and favorable long-term prospects
Low technology/fashion obsolescence

Strength of balance sheet and free cash flow generation

Superior long-term profitability
High returns
Balance sheet strength
Debt coverage

Solid management behaviors and culture

Accretive share repurchases
Stable accounting practices
Consistent communication
Reinvestment trends
Dividend history
M&A

Company has “edge” on competitors

Distinguishable product or service
Durable advantage over the long-term
If no competitive advantage; company must be a low-cost operator






Step 3Build



Establish probability-weighted price targets to build concentrated portfolios.










Establishing Probability-Weighted Price Targets

Guides entry and exit positions
Review investment thesis and probability-weighted price targets at minimum on a quarterly basis

Sell Discipline

Deterioration in company fundamentals that change investment thesis or risk profile
A more attractive investment opportunity exists in another company
Exceeding estimated fair value
Misjudgment

General Guidelines for Portfolio Construction

Build concentrated positions in companies, industries, and sectors that are fundamentally and quantitatively attractive
Investment with at least 2-3 year time frame
We do not constrain the portfolio to any systematic risk factors
Be fully invested

SCP Philosophy


We believe that short-term market fluctuations can create long-term investment oppotunities that can be systematically identified. 







 



														1													

Investment
Factors
Three anomalies — Valuation, Quality, and Market Reaction—have historically outperformed the market over long time periods




 



														2													

Margin
of Safety
The difference between the stock price and its estimated value is the margin of safety, which can minimize the risk of loss




 



														3													

Ownership
Mentality
An investment is an ownership stake in the underlying business




 



														4													

Concentration
of Capital
High conviction investments maximize the probability of compounding capital over the long term
