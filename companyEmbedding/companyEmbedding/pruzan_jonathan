The Bretton Woods Committee

                  The Bretton Woods Committee is the nonpartisan network of prominent global citizens, which works to demonstrate the value of international economic cooperation and to foster strong, effective Bretton Woods institutions as forces for global well-being.

The Committee was created in 1983 at the suggestion of two former Treasury officials - Secretary Henry Fowler and Deputy Secretary Charls Walker, a Democrat and a Republican - who saw the need for an organized effort to ensure that leading citizens spoke about the importance of the international financial institutions (IFIs).

Committee members are leaders at the top of the business, finance, academic, and non-profit sectors, including many industry CEOs, as well as former presidents, cabinet-level officials, and lawmakers who share the belief that international economic cooperation is essential and best served through strong and effective IFIs. Through the Committee, they champion global efforts to spur economic growth, alleviate poverty, and improve financial stability.

The Committee organizes frequent conferences, seminars, and educational activities. Many of these events are designed to reach a broad public audience, while others offer members the opportunity to provide important advice, support, and constructive criticism to the management of the IFIs. Working closely with successive U.S. administrations, the Committee also reminds elected leaders that global economic prosperity and lasting national security are closely tied to continued progress on multilateral issues.

The Committee relies solely on the funding of its members and does not accept funds from governments or the multilateral institutions.

Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics

                    The Peterson Institute for International Economics is a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of international economic policy. Since 1981 the Institute has provided timely and objective analysis of, and concrete solutions to, a wide range of international economic problems. It is one of the very few think tanks that are widely regarded as "nonpartisan" by the press and "neutral" by the US Congress. Its research staff has been cited by the quality media more than that of any other such institution. It was voted "best think tank in the world" in 2008 by the first global survey of over 5,000 such institutions and again in 2011 by the British magazine Prospect, whose selections are called "the Oscars of the think tank world" by the BBC.

The Institute, attempts to anticipate emerging issues and to be ready with practical ideas, presented in user-friendly formats, to inform and shape public debate. Its audience includes government officials and legislators, business and labor leaders, management and staff at international organizations, university-based scholars and their students, other research institutions and nongovernmental organizations, the media, and the public at large. It addresses these groups globally from its base in Washington, DC.

The Institute’s staff of about 50 includes 20 senior researchers, all distinguished for their combination of research productivity and policy experience. The Institute’s agenda emphasizes global macroeconomic policy, international finance and exchange rates, trade and investment, energy and the environment, and area studies of key economic regions. Institute staff and research cover all key regions—especially Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as the United States itself and with special reference to China, India, Korea, and Russia.

Current priority is attached to the global financial and economic crisis and especially its European component; debt and recovery; the growing role of China in the world economy; the economic dimensions of the Arab Spring; globalization and its political controversies; global imbalances and exchange rates; national and international financial regulations; export competitiveness; reform of the international economic and financial architecture; sovereign wealth funds; and trade negotiations at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral levels.

Institute studies have helped provide the intellectual foundation for many of the major international policy initiatives of the past three decades: reforms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including those initiated by the G-20 in 2009–10; adoption of international banking standards and broader financial regulatory reforms; the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and Trans-Pacific Partnership; the restoration and then extension of trade promotion authority in the United States; the development of the World Trade Organization; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other US free trade agreements (including with Korea notably); initiation and implementation of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the United States and China; a series of United States–Japan negotiations; reform of sanctions policy; liberalization of US export controls and export credits, and specific trade issues such as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China in 2000 and Russia in 2012, import protection for steel, and Buy American legislation in 2009.

Other influential analyses have addressed economic reform in Europe, Japan, the former communist countries, and Latin America (including what became known as the Washington Consensus), the social impact of globalization and policy responses to it, outsourcing, corruption, foreign direct investment both into and out of the United States, global warming and international environmental policy, measures of currency manipulation and of equilibrium exchange rates, and the sources and growth of services trade.

With Jonathan Pruzan’s Promotion,   Morgan Stanley CEO Gorman Grooming Firm Leadership’s Next Generation





Last Tuesday,   Morgan Stanley announced that investment banker Jonathan Pruzan,   46,   would succeed finance chief Ruth Porat,   who leaves for Google Inc.							















 

Morgan Stanley Chairman and Chief Executive James Gorman,   56,   plans more changes in his management team in the near future,   the Wall Street Journal reported.
Gorman is preparing Morgan Stanley for the next phase of its transformation,   grooming the new generation of executives who are still in their 40s.
Gorman,   who says he is “the accidental CEO,  ” wants his successor,   when the time comes,   to be better prepared.
Last Tuesday,   Morgan Stanley announced that investment banker Jonathan Pruzan,   46,   would succeed finance chief Ruth Porat,   who leaves for Google Inc.
According to a memo Gorman wrote to employees,   Pruzan,   who has spent almost half his life at Morgan Stanley,   co-leads the team that advises banks and other financial-services companies.
For most of his career,   Pruzan has been a banker to banks. He was promoted to his current role as global co-head of the financial institutions group in 2010,   succeeding Porat in that role. His promotion actually coincided with Mr. Gorman’s elevation to the CEO role.
Gorman wrote that Pruzan “understands the current regulatory environment” in post 2008 Wall Street.
“He brings both great technical skill and proven leadership to this new role,  ” Gorman stated. “Healthy change maintains the vitality of an organization,   and energizes and engages individual leaders at every level of the firm. These changes are part of our continued path forward from a period of repositioning to a period of growth.”
Five years ago,   Gorman inherited a firm that had barely avoided annihilation during the financial crisis. He boosted the wealth-management direction by grabbing Citigroup’s Smith Barney unit while the crisis was still good and chaotic,   and shifted away from risk-taking trading,   which had become entangled in new rules.
Despite a pace that was too slow for Gorman,   eventually,   wealth-management started producing higher profits. Morgan Stanley was then able to return more capital to shareholders in stock buybacks and dividends,   the WSJ reported. And with the growth in revenue,   the stock price rose.

Jonathan Pruzan: Banker to the Banks

							Morgan Stanley investment banker's team playbook helped the firm surge to No. 2 in bank equity deals for the year.
						


By Heidi Moore





Even before the Obama administration subjected 19 major
    banks to stress tests this spring, Jonathan Pruzan and his
    colleagues in Morgan Stanleys financial institutions
    group were working on how to help lenders replenish their
    equity coffers. Last summer, Morgan Stanley created a team of
    about 20 people, including bankers as well as professionals
    from fixed income, structured finance and equity capital
    markets, that began meeting three times a week to brainstorm.
    It was led by Pruzan, the co-head of North American FIG, and
    two key senior colleagues, John Esposito and Taylor Wright.
In May, when the results of the stress tests were announced
    and the banks were ordered to raise capital, Morgan Stanley
    sprang into action. The playbook developed by Pruzan and his
    group included overnight deals, which are pulled together
    quickly to take advantage of sudden market opportunities;
    marketed deals, which are sold over a period of days; and
    "dribble-outs"  quiet, steady block trades in which a
    bank can sell as much as 10 percent of its monthly stock
    volume. "We were advising all our clients to be ready at a
    moments notice," says Pruzan, 41.
The results have not been too shabby. As of June 22, Morgan
    Stanley had surged to No. 2 in bank equity deals for the year,
    up from No. 9 at the same time in 2008, according to Dealogic.
    The firm has advised 11 U.S. banks on raising $11.98 billion in
    equity capital, just behind Goldman Sachs Group, which has
    advised 12 banks on $12.11 billion in such deals. Pruzan led
    the Morgan Stanley team that generated $2.7 billion for U.S.
    Bancorp, $1.7 billion for BB&T Corp., $1.6 billion for
    SunTrust Banks and $750 million for Fifth Third Bancorp.
The firm moved fast in every case. About one fifth of Fifth
    Thirds dribble-out had been completed when a sudden burst
    of investor demand set Morgan Stanley running to sell the
    remaining $600 million through block trades on June 1. The head
    of Morgan Stanleys equity syndicate, Mohit Assomull, gave
    the sale order over the squawk box at 4:20 in the afternoon. By
    5:00, Pruzan had called Fifth Third to let it know there was
    buying interest for more than $1 billion. 
Pruzan grew up in New York City, but well outside the world
    of Wall Street. His father and grandparents worked in the
    garment industry. Pruzan followed the lead of his two brothers,
    who worked at McKinsey & Co. and Goldman Sachs,
    respectively, in the swaggering, deal-making era of the late
    1980s.
Pruzan joined PaineWebber & Co.s financial
    institutions group in 1990, the year he graduated from Tufts
    University with a degree in political science and economics.
    His first job was as an analyst working for James Kilman, a
    banker whom Pruzan helped hire at Morgan Stanley last year to
    head its specialty finance advisory group. Pruzan moved to
    Morgan Stanley from PaineWebber in 1994. He advised on a flurry
    of bank deals, from the seminal merger of Chase Manhattan Corp.
    and Chemical Banking Corp. to Deutsche Banks purchase of
    Bankers Trust Co. to Bank of America Corp.s acquisitions
    of FleetBoston Financial and LaSalle Bank Corp.
In 2006 he was promoted by Derek Kirkland, then head of FIG
    and now a senior adviser at Morgan Stanley, to oversee its U.S.
    group. Pruzan took up his new post last year just in time for
    the biggest bank crisis in more than 70 years. "One of the
    lessons is that market perception becomes reality," he notes.
    "You might not agree with it, but its best to accept it
    and move on."
GMAC Financial Services chief finance officer Rob Hull has
    appreciated that no-nonsense view as Pruzan has helped the
    finance company wrest its independence away from General Motors
    Corp. "Jon has been able to distill strategic options when
    theyve not been easily discernible," Hull says.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
