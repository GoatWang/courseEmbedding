Insurance Services
  
We will work with you to design your personalized financial plan and to monitor your progress on an ongoing basis.  We collaborate, as desired, with family members, business partners and other financial professionals to ensure that all pieces come together in the most effective manner.  We work with you to implement your financial plan, recommending various strategies and a broad array of financial products for your consideration.
Education Funding
You do so many things, every day, to prepare your children for life’s experiences. But as you prepare your children, you also have to prepare yourself – financially. The cost of attending college can be daunting, so the sooner you start saving the better. Two keys to saving for college are starting early and making regular, consistent contributions over time. Work with Jimmy Carlson, who can offer you a number of ways to plan and save for higher education. Learn more about these ways to save:
• 529 Plan
• Coverdell IRA
• UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)
• UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act)
Life Insurance
Life insurance provides not only income continuation for those depending on you, it can also help your family and business cover debt. Insurance may be the key to keep your business in the family, allow your children to graduate from college, and/or permit your spouse to continue living in your home.
Retirement Planning
Whether you are 25 years or 5 years from retirement, it is essential to plan ahead; it’s smart too, because the longer you put it off, the harder it will be to accumulate the amount you need to retire. The most convenient way to amass and grow your retirement savings is to allocate a specific dollar amount – or percentage of your salary. Start now and contribute even a small amount each month. Investment Adviser Representative Jimmy Carlson can help you to strategize for the future by helping you to:
• Decide which investment strategy is appropriate for you, your family, and your future
• Review the investment vehicles used to build a nest egg
• Discuss risk assessment, time horizon and review asset allocation models
• Understand market fluctuation and how it may affect your goals
Investing
We begin by getting a clear understanding of your overall financial goals and your goals for each investment account. We discuss your investment preferences and concerns, your attitudes toward risk and your time frame for the assets in each account. To implement your various investment strategies, we’ll work with you to build appropriately diversified portfolios, with access to the following:
• Managed Accounts
• Mutual Funds
• Individual, Joint, Trust accounts
• IRAs, Roth IRAs
• 529 Plans
• Fixed and Variable Annuities
Wealth Management
Through comprehensive wealth management solutions designed for the high-net worth clients, we enable clients to take advantage of:
• The exercising of employee stock options
• Transactions involving restricted and control stock
• Wealth management and liquidity solutions
Estate Planning
Successful estate planning eases the transfer of your assets to your beneficiaries efficiently and with minimal tax consequences. Estate planning can also assure that family members know how you would like your financial and medical affairs to be handled in the event you become incapable of making your own decisions. The process of estate planning includes taking inventory of your assets, talking over important decisions with family members, making a will and, in some cases, establishing a trust. You should consult an attorney, and perhaps a CPA or tax advisor, for additional guidance tailored to your specific situation.
Insurance Services
We discuss with you your general attitudes toward risk, underline various risks and review the numerous options to manage and / or mitigate these forms of risk. We will perform a full policy and beneficiary review, as well as the review of trusts that may own certain policies. We can offer access to the following solutions:
• Life Insurance
• Disability Income Protection
• Long-Term Care Insurance
• Business Income Continuation, Succession and Estate Conservation strategies*

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
