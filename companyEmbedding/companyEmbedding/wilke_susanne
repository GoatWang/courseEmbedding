NEWARK, N.J., Sept. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Neurotrope, Inc. (OTCQB: NTRP), a company focused on developing drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, today announced that it has appointed Dr. Susanne Wilke, PhD as Chief Executive Officer.  Dr. Wilke brings significant leadership, sector and investing experience to Neurotrope based upon her work at leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including Hoffman La Roche, Amgen, and Forest Labs.  Dr. Wilke also served as a Kaufman Fellow at Schroder Ventures Life Sciences, a leading international Venture Capital Firm, and was an Investment Principal at NGN Capital. We believe that she has a track record of identifying biotechnology companies with unique and promising drug candidates and then bringing them to public markets in order to access the depth of capital needed to develop clinical stage assets.








Dr. Wilke holds a dual degree Doctorate in both Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, with an emphasis on drug development, from the University of Illinois at Chicago.   She also earned her MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.  Dr. Wilke commented, "Neurotrope's lead drug bryostatin, as well as related platform compounds, have demonstrated their multi-modal efficacy, in preclinical models, to induce the growth of new synaptic networks in degenerating brain tissue by activating PKC epsilon.  It was demonstrated in these models that PKC epsilon appears to drive synaptogenesis via growth factors in the brain such as BDNF, IGF-1 and NGF.   At the same time, the bryostatin and analogs seem to prevent amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles."  Dr. Wilke continued, "The same multi-modal efficacy has been demonstrated for Fragile X Syndrome mental retardation in preclinical models.  Going forward, we continue to build a strong team and are constructing a comprehensive business plan that will attempt to develop bryostatin, and the PKC epsilon activating platform, to potentially treat Alzheimer's disease and other areas of high unmet medical need such as Fragile X Syndrome and Rett Syndrome." 
Dr. Alkon, Chief Scientific Officer and a co-founder of Neurotrope stated, "Working with Dr. Wilke, first as a consultant and then as a board member during the past year, I have found her input very insightful.  She has applicable and relevant experience integrating scientific understanding with commercial and financial understanding and setting strategic clinical, corporate and financial goals.  Her background and network will be invaluable in helping Neurotrope reach the key milestones necessary to take the company to the next level.   We are actively engaged in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study for Alzheimer's disease that we expect, upon completion, will expand into follow-on clinical trials.   We are also preparing to start clinical trials on new programs such as Fragile X Syndrome.  I believe this is a very exciting time to be involved with the Company."
Further details may be found in the Company's Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
About Neurotrope          
Neurotrope BioScience, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Neurotrope, Inc., is a biotechnology company focused on developing a novel therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.   The scientific basis of our treatment is activation of Protein Kinase C isozymes ε and α by bryostatin, a natural product, which in mouse AD models was demonstrated to result in repair and replacement of damaged synapses (synaptogenesis).  PKC epsilon has also exhibited the ability to prevent neuronal death, reduce toxic beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles, and enhance memory and learning, thus having the potential to improve cognition, daily functions, mood and behavior in Alzheimer's disease patients.  
Neurotrope is also conducting preclinical studies of bryostatin as a treatment for Fragile X Syndrome and Niemann-Pick Type C disease, two rare genetic diseases for which only symptomatic treatments are currently available. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Neurotrope for bryostatin as a treatment for Fragile X Syndrome.  Bryostatin has undergone testing in over 1,400 people establishing a large safety database.
Neurotrope has exclusively licensed technology from the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute for Alzheimer's disease and Fragile X Syndrome, has a world-wide, exclusive license with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai for Niemann-Pick Type C disease and is partnered with Stanford University to synthesize and find the next generation bryostatin – called bryologs.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding the proposed study and timing of initiation, and continued development of use of bryostatin for Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive diseases, and the Company's ability to list its common shares on a major stock exchange.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other influences, many of which the Company has no control over. Actual results and the timing of certain events and circumstances may differ materially from those described by the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties. Factors that may influence or cause actual results to differ materially from expected or desired results may include, without limitation, the Company's inability to obtain adequate financing, the significant length of time associated with drug development and related insufficient cash flows and resulting illiquidity, the Company's patent portfolio, the Company's inability to expand the Company's business, the Company's inability to meet listing requirements for major stock exchanges, significant government regulation of pharmaceuticals and the healthcare industry, lack of product diversification, availability of the Company's raw materials, existing or increased competition,  stock volatility and illiquidity, and the Company's failure to implement the Company's business plans or strategies. These and other factors are identified and described in more detail in the Company's filings with the SEC, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements.

(NTRP), a company focused on developing drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, today announced that it has appointed Dr. Susanne Wilke, PhD as Chief Executive Officer.  Dr. Wilke brings significant leadership, sector and investing experience to Neurotrope based upon her work at leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including Hoffman La Roche, Amgen, and Forest Labs.  Dr. Wilke also served as a Kaufman Fellow at Schroder Ventures Life Sciences, a leading international Venture Capital Firm, and was an Investment Principal at NGN Capital. We believe that she has a track record of identifying biotechnology companies with unique and promising drug candidates and then bringing them to public markets in order to access the depth of capital needed to develop clinical stage assets.Dr. Wilke holds a dual degree Doctorate in both Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, with an emphasis on drug development, from the University of Illinois at Chicago.   She also earned her MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.  Dr. Wilke commented, "Neurotrope's lead drug bryostatin, as well as related platform compounds, have demonstrated their multi-modal efficacy, in preclinical models, to induce the growth of new synaptic networks in degenerating brain tissue by activating PKC epsilon.  It was demonstrated in these models that PKC epsilon appears to drive synaptogenesis via growth factors in the brain such as BDNF, IGF-1 and NGF.   At the same time, the bryostatin and analogs seem to prevent amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles."  Dr. Wilke continued, "The same multi-modal efficacy has been demonstrated for Fragile X Syndrome mental retardation in preclinical models.  Going forward, we continue to build a strong team and are constructing a comprehensive business plan that will attempt to develop bryostatin, and the PKC epsilon activating platform, to potentially treat Alzheimer's disease and other areas of high unmet medical need such as Fragile X Syndrome and Rett Syndrome."Dr. Alkon, Chief Scientific Officer and a co-founder of Neurotrope stated, "Working with Dr. Wilke, first as a consultant and then as a board member during the past year, I have found her input very insightful.  She has applicable and relevant experience integrating scientific understanding with commercial and financial understanding and setting strategic clinical, corporate and financial goals.  Her background and network will be invaluable in helping Neurotrope reach the key milestones necessary to take the company to the next level.   We are actively engaged in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study for Alzheimer's disease that we expect, upon completion, will expand into follow-on clinical trials.   We are also preparing to start clinical trials on new programs such as Fragile X Syndrome.  I believe this is a very exciting time to be involved with the Company."Further details may be found in the Company's Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).About Neurotrope         Neurotrope BioScience, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Neurotrope, Inc., is a biotechnology company focused on developing a novel therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.   The scientific basis of our treatment is activation of Protein Kinase C isozymes ε and α by bryostatin, a natural product, which in mouse AD models was demonstrated to result in repair and replacement of damaged synapses (synaptogenesis).  PKC epsilon has also exhibited the ability to prevent neuronal death, reduce toxic beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles, and enhance memory and learning, thus having the potential to improve cognition, daily functions, mood and behavior in Alzheimer's disease patients. Neurotrope is also conducting preclinical studies of bryostatin as a treatment for Fragile X Syndrome and Niemann-Pick Type C disease, two rare genetic diseases for which only symptomatic treatments are currently available. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Neurotrope for bryostatin as a treatment for Fragile X Syndrome.  Bryostatin has undergone testing in over 1,400 people establishing a large safety database.Read MoreNeurotrope has exclusively licensed technology from the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute for Alzheimer's disease and Fragile X Syndrome, has a world-wide, exclusive license with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai for Niemann-Pick Type C disease and is partnered with Stanford University to synthesize and find the next generation bryostatin – called bryologs.Forward-Looking StatementsAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding the proposed study and timing of initiation, and continued development of use of bryostatin for Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive diseases, and the Company's ability to list its common shares on a major stock exchange.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other influences, many of which the Company has no control over. Actual results and the timing of certain events and circumstances may differ materially from those described by the forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties. Factors that may influence or cause actual results to differ materially from expected or desired results may include, without limitation, the Company's inability to obtain adequate financing, the significant length of time associated with drug development and related insufficient cash flows and resulting illiquidity, the Company's patent portfolio, the Company's inability to expand the Company's business, the Company's inability to meet listing requirements for major stock exchanges, significant government regulation of pharmaceuticals and the healthcare industry, lack of product diversification, availability of the Company's raw materials, existing or increased competition,  stock volatility and illiquidity, and the Company's failure to implement the Company's business plans or strategies. These and other factors are identified and described in more detail in the Company's filings with the SEC, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
