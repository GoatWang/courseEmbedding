                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms Three Honda Auto Receivables Owner Trusts; Outlook Stable



2015-09-02 21:13:13









NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings on the following Honda Auto Receivables Owner Trusts:2013-1--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.2013-4--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.2014-4--Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and CE, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents.The ratings reflect the quality of American Honda Finance Corp.'s retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the transactions.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.DUE DILIGENCE USAGENo third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of these transactions can be found in 'Honda Auto Receivables 2013-4 Owner Trust - Appendix', 'Honda Auto Receivables 2013-1 Owner Trust - Appendix' and 'Honda Auto Receivables 2014-4 Owner Trust - Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2015.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaGlobal Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 06 Jul 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=867952Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 10 Apr 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=863979Related ResearchHonda Auto Receivables 2013-1 Owner Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=708549Honda Auto Receivables 2013-4 Owner Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=721377Honda Auto Receivables 2014-4 Owner Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=813248Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm pr_id=990304Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation pr_id=990304Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Excellent Mobile Shopping Experience Raises Likelihood of Test Drive


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 13 Oct. 2016 — More automakers are providing responsive and responsive/adaptive websites—sites that automatically reformat to fit the device on which they’re being viewed—yet their satisfaction still trails traditional sites overall, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Automotive Mobile Site StudySM released today.Nearly three-fourths (72%) of manufacturers now offer some form of responsive website—up from 39% 12 months ago—in part because overall mobile usage for automotive shopping continues to trend upward.Satisfaction is important to manufacturers because it increases the likelihood of a shopper taking a test drive. The study shows that among vehicle shoppers who are delighted with their experience on a manufacturer brand website (overall satisfaction scores above 900), 65% say they are more likely to test drive a vehicle, compared with only 15% of those who are disappointed (scores of 500 and below).But designing and executing an effective site that will be viewed through multiple devices is not that easy.  The study finds that when manufacturers launch a responsive or responsive/adaptive site, navigation and speed satisfaction usually experience the biggest drops after implementation. Over time, though, satisfaction with such websites has shown improvement. For example, when examining the first manufacturer sites that transitioned to responsive design, overall satisfaction has increased to 778 in 2016 from 770 in 2014, driven by significant increases in speed satisfaction (771 in 2016 vs. 751 in 2014).“Automotive manufacturer and third-party websites are increasingly being accessed via smartphones by new-vehicle shoppers,” said Deirdre Borrego, senior vice president and general manager of data & analytics at J.D. Power. “With so much at stake, manufacturers and third-party sites have to figure out how to execute an excellent online shopping experience, regardless of device.”Automakers and third-party companies use one of three typical web design approaches:Responsive provides optimal viewing of one layout that adjusts the content display based on the screen size.Adaptive offers several distinct layouts optimized for various device types. Adaptive sites must maintain separate content/asset libraries for each layout, thereby increasing cost.Responsive/Adaptive is a hybrid technique that adjusts the layout/content based on the screen size, but also senses the device type, thus allowing for customized content and navigation for that device type.The study also finds that satisfaction with manufacturers’ mobile websites is quite different between Boomers[1] and Gen Y. Satisfaction is significantly lower among vehicle shoppers in the Boomer generation than among those in Gen Y across all measures: overall (759 vs. 799, respectively); navigation (733 vs. 794); appearance (784 vs. 821); information/content (759 vs. 792); and speed (757 vs. 790).Manufacturer Website Study RankingsInfiniti (805) ranks highest in overall manufacturer website satisfaction, followed by Jeep (803), Dodge (801) and Lincoln (801).Third-Party Website Study RankingsCars.com (751) ranks highest in overall third-party website satisfaction, followed by TrueCar (740) and U.S. News Best Cars (740).About the StudyThe 2016 Automotive Mobile Site Study examines the features and content of automotive manufacturer and third-party mobile websites and their usefulness in the vehicle-shopping process. The study includes more than 11,500 evaluations of automotive mobile websites from vehicle shoppers who intend to purchase or lease a vehicle within the next two years. The study was fielded in July and August 2016.For more information about the 2016 Automotive Mobile Site Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/jd-power-automotive-mobile-site-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.
