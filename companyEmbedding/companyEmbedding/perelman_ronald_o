Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]

Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]

Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Ronald Perelman Settles Revlon Privatization Case With SEC





















–

Ronald Perelman / Bloomberg
–
/By Clive Minchom/
On June 13th,    2013 Revlon,    the publicly listed cosmetics company controlled by Ronald O. Perelman’s investment company MacAndrews & Forbes,    and of which he is Chairman and CEO,    settled a dispute with the US financial industries regulator the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC ),    relating to an unsuccessful attempt he made in 2009 to take Revlon private – a company which he has controlled about 77% of since 1985. Mr. Perelman is certainly no stranger to litigation,    or to complicated transactions. Indeed it is probably no accident that in the degrees of complexity itself one can ultimately find tucked away issues that are the ones that end up being litigated.
Under the terms of the settlement with the SEC Revlon agreed to pay a – very modest – fine of US$850,   000 in order to put to bed the SEC’s findings that it had deceived shareholders and its independent directors during the failed privatization attempt. According to the New York Times,    Revlon has also already paid out,    in addition,    about US$37 million in private lawsuits to shareholders and former shareholders to put the story behind it.
The SEC press release announcing the settlement quoted Antonia Chion,    an Associate Director in the SEC’s division of enforcement in connection with the settlement: “Going-private transactions create opportunities for shareholder abuse and can have coercive effects on minority shareholders,   ”…. “By erecting informational barriers,    Revlon kept critically important information from its board and,    in turn,    misled investors.”
In settling with the SEC and with its private claimants Revlon neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.
MacAndrews & Forbes has controlled over three quarters of Revlon’s stock since 1985,    so the company has had little shareholder “float” which has therefore tended to discourage trading since he took it over. In such circumstances,    even in the best of times the share price of a comparatively illiquid security can languish and lag its peers significantly.
In 2009 during the height of then recessionary business conditions Perelman tried in response to take over the rest of the shares he did not already own. When you do something like that,    however,    independent directors and external third party advisors are usually called upon to determine that the terms of any such transaction are fair to the minority interests being acquired – whenever there is an insider with a potential informational advantage.
On his first attempt in 2009,    it seems the independent third party financial advisor determined that the terms Perelman was proposing were indeed not fair to the minority shareholders of Revlon. Accordingly,    as the New York Times reported last week,    Pereleman restructured his offer in response by proposing instead a a transaction in which the company asked minority shareholders to swap their stock for preferred shares.
The complex deal would apparently have also helped Revlon pay off a substantial loan that it owed to MacAndrews & Forbes,    the SEC found as the tendered common shares would have then been simultaneously exchanged for a settlement of existing debt to its controlling shareholder. However because Mr. Perelman also stood on both sides of this deal,    there was a basic question about the transaction’s fairness and Revlon again asked its independent board members to assess the deal.
Revlon’s minority shareholders included persons invested in its stock through the company’s 401(k) retirement plan and the retirement plan’s trustee decided that its members could exchange their shares only if an outside investment banker decided that the transaction was adequate. On looking at it,    the outside financial adviser chosen determined that it was also,    like the previous going-private transaction itself,    unfair – since in his opinion the preferred shares being offered were not equal to the value of the common stock being sought.
Well that was his opinion,    but Revlon,    however,    apparently then went to great lengths to hide that decision from the individual retirement plan members themselves,    which was the crux of the complaint made by the SEC. The SEC had also charged that among other deceitful maneuvers,    Revlon altered the agreement with the trustee to ensure that the trustee would not share the adviser’s opinion with Revlon shareholders. The company also then apparently misrepresented in securities filings that the board’s process was “full,    fair and complete.”
So with the settlements with the SEC and with its own dissident shareholder groups this is now all behind Revlon and the company’s shares have also even been doing quite well,    up 40% in the last twelve months,    certainly rebounding from its state in 2009 when,    during the depths of the recession,    Revlon had become quite a troubled business. Revlon posted losses for a number of years after Perelman’s original acquisition,    losing market share to competitors like L’Oreal,    Estée Lauder and Procter & Gamble,    and it suffered under a heavy debt load,    some of which likely related to the acquisition itself.
Even so a market cap of US$ 1 billion on its current price of about US$20 per share is still a substantial company,    with a widely accepted range of products that are liked by its customers. According to some analysts the current share price may be only about 11 times projected 2013 earnings – compared to an estimated 25 times for competitors and rivals Estée Lauder and L’Oréal. Maybe the recent share price up-tick reflects hopes of a renewed privatization offer from Perelman – only this time one on more transparent terms and presumably reflecting improved conditions.
About Ronald Perelman
Ronald O. Perelman is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc.,    a diversified holding company with interests in consumer products,    entertainment,    financial services,    biotechnology and gaming. Among the principal interests of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. are: Revlon,    Inc.,    AM General,    Scientific Games Corporation,    TransTech Pharma,    Inc.,    SIGA Technologies,    Inc.,    Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.,    Harland Clarke,    Harland Financial Solutions,    Scantron and Global Scholar.
While he is certainly a tough-minded businessman Ronald Perelman gives back to the community and is a major philanthropist to many worthwhile causes. He made big headlines just a month ago with a gift of US$100 million to the Columbia Business School to found the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation. His own university,    the University of Pennsylvania has not missed out either,    receiving a US$25 million gift earlier in 2013.
Mr. Perelman is an active philanthropist who believes powerful results can be achieved when financial resources are leveraged with human resolve. He has established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program,    the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at New York University Langone Medical Center,    the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute at New York Presbyterian Hospital and the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical Center.
He serves on the Board of the University of Pennsylvania,    the New York University Langone Medical Center,    New York Presbyterian Hospital,    Weill Cornell Medical Center,    Columbia University,    Ford’s Theater,    Apollo Theater Foundation and the Executive Board of Carnegie Hall. He is a member of the French Legion of Honor.
Perelman was born in Greensboro,    North Carolina in 1943,    the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman and was raised in a Jewish family environment. His father was an accomplished businessman who,    with his own father and brother,    controlled the American Paper Products corporation.
By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father’s company; by all accounts his father was a rough teacher,    harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest mistakes.
After graduating from Cheltenham High School,    in Wyncote,    Pa in 1962. Perelman attended The Haverford School and then the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father’s footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master’s degree in 1966.
On setting out on his own in his business ultimately,    one of his early acquisitions was MacAndrews & Forbes,    at that time a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors of the company initially repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase it and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition,    but in the end Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it ten years earlier made the success particularly sweet,    and the memory of the transaction clearly lives on as MacAndrews & Forbes subsequently morphed into the holding vehicle for all his investments.
Ronald Perelman lives in New York City and has been married five times,    currently to Dr. Anna Chapman a psychiatrist whom he married in 2010 and he is the father of seven children. As of 2012,    according to Forbes Perelman is the 26th richest American,    and 69th richest person in the world,    with an estimated wealth of $12 billion.

Mr. Perelman’s commitment to education and passion for entrepreneurship is reflected by his landmark donation to Columbia Business School in 2013, establishing the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation. The gift will fund the creation of a new facility and develop programming for the next generation of global business leaders.

As chairman of Revlon, Mr. Perelman has demonstrated a longstanding commitment to improving women’s health. In 1990 he created the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program, which led to the development of Herceptin, the groundbreaking treatment for breast cancer. The EIF Revlon Run/Walk has raised more than $100 million to fight women’s cancers. In 2014, he co-founded, along with Barbra Streisand, the Women’s Heart Alliance to raise awareness, encourage action and drive new research to fight heart disease in women.
As a champion of culture, in June 2016, Mr. Perelman announced a $75 million lead gift to fund the Perelman Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center. Scheduled to open in early 2020, the new Perelman Center will serve as a world-class performance space in Lower Manhattan, producing and premiering new works of theater, dance, music, film and opera.
Mr. Perelman is the Vice Chairman of the Apollo Theater Foundation and sits on the board of many institutions. Among them are: The Museum of Modern Art; New York Presbyterian Hospital; Weill Cornell Medical Center; Columbia Business School; NYU Langone Medical Center and The One Foundation.

Ronald O. Perelman Institute for Judaic Studies
“I am delighted to have the opportunity to establish this program, which will shape intellectual concepts in the field, promote interdisciplinary research and scholarship, and perhaps most important, bring Jewish civilization to life for Princeton students”—Ronald O. Perelman

�
Financier and philanthropist Ronald O. Perelman, well known as an innovative leader and generous supporter of many of the nation's most prominent cultural and educational institutions, gave Princeton University a gift of $4.7 million in 1995 to create a multidisciplinary institute focusing on Jewish studies. The establishment of the Ronald O. Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies produced the first opportunity for undergraduate students to earn a certificate in Jewish Studies, strengthening Princeton's long tradition of interdisciplinary studies and broad commitment to Jewish culture. The gift from Mr. Perelman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MacAndrews and Forbes Inc., also supports a senior faculty position—the Ronald O. Perelman Professor of Jewish Studies—and a wide variety of academic and scholarly activities that bring together leading scholars to examine Jewish history, religion, literature, thought, society, politics and cultures.

Less than a year since he stepped down as the chairman of Carnegie Hall after clashing with its staff, Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire businessman, announced Wednesday that he was donating $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.His donation immediately catapulted the long-stalled performing arts center, one of the last major pieces of unfinished business at the World Trade Center site, from aspirational to achievable and places him among a new generation of power brokers and billionaires who are reshaping — and renaming — the cultural infrastructure of New York. In recognition of his gift, the new theater complex, which will sit on one of the most emotionally resonant and most visited spots in the city, will be named for Mr. Perelman.“I think that this is a project that must happen,” Mr. Perelman said in an interview, adding that he had been drawn to it by the vision of the role that art could play at the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and in the continuing rebuilding of the area. “It is more than just a pure artistic center to serve a community. It is that, but at the same time it’s much more than that.”In the last few years, the city’s wealthy elite have chiseled their names into some of the city’s most iconic cultural institutions — or sought to build their own. The New York Public Library’s main branch on Fifth Avenue has been renamed for Stephen A. Schwarzman, the old New York State Theater for David H. Koch and Avery Fisher (nee Philharmonic) Hall at Lincoln Center for David Geffen.

The new Perelman center is also joining several other projects that are being planned, including Culture Shed, a performance space at the Hudson Yards on the West Side, and a new park on Pier 55 near 14th Street with three outdoor spaces underwritten by the billionaire Barry Diller. Some arts executives have questioned whether the city had the audiences and donor base to sustain so many new cultural spaces. Continue reading the main story

But culture has long been envisioned as a key part of the rebuilt World Trade Center and was an important feature of the architect Daniel Libeskind’s 2003 master plan for the site. The performing arts center was placed on the back burner, though, as officials wrangled over the many other thorny issues involved in redevelopment. Groups including the old New York City Opera, the Signature Theater Company and the Joyce Theater all explored anchoring the new complex, but nothing came of it. The architect Frank Gehry was hired to design it, then his design was shelved. The project, which was championed by the Bloomberg administration and eagerly sought by downtown residents, was kept alive through the administrations of four governors and two mayors.The seeds of Mr. Perelman’s involvement were planted a decade ago when Michael R. Bloomberg, who was the mayor, became the chairman of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum to restore confidence in the project, which had gone off track. Mr. Bloomberg recalled in an interview that one of the first donors he turned to was Mr. Perelman, who quickly agreed to donate $5 million to the museum project. Mr. Perelman stayed involved, expressing enthusiasm for the idea of a performing arts center at the site, and, as the project finally took shape recently, he agreed to make the lead gift.

“Perelman’s a funny guy — if he’s interested in the institution and its mission, he’s a very easy sell,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “There have been times I had to sell him when he didn’t care very much, and that took a little more work.”The backers of the new Perelman center downtown see it as filling an important niche for a midsize theater that can accommodate the kinds of multidisciplinary works many artists experiment with today. The complex, which is being designed by REX, a Brooklyn-based architecture firm, is to include three flexible, technologically advanced theaters that can individually seat 499 people, 299 people and 100 people, and which can be combined into one space that can accommodate 1,200. The plan calls for the center to present or produce dance, concerts, new or early chamber opera, and theater, and to become the main venue of the Tribeca Film Festival each April.The performance plans have yet to come fully into focus: David Lan, the artistic director at the Young Vic in London, did a stint as its temporary artistic director, and Jenny Gersten, a former executive director of Friends of the High Line and artistic director of the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, is a producing consultant. But the presence of Mr. Perelman, a hard-charging businessman who is known to favor a hands-on approach with groups that he supports, suggests that there will be a powerful, wealthy patron pushing for it to succeed.

Mr. Perelman left Carnegie after spending less than a year as its chairman after clashing with its staff and other board members — and before making an additional donation to the hall that had been expected to be in the $30 million range. He said in the interview that his support of the new performing arts center was unrelated to his departure from Carnegie and that he probably would have made the donation to support the new complex in any case.With Mr. Perelman’s donation, the project is now well on its way to covering its estimated $240 million price tag, said Maggie Boepple, the center’s president and director. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation committed $100 million in federal funds awarded after the Sept. 11 attacks for the project’s design, construction and administrative costs.“Ronald’s gift is going to open the doors,” Ms. Boepple said. “We have some other donors in the wings.”

Mr. Perelman, who raised eyebrows with his call to stage more pop music at Carnegie Hall, said that he envisioned attracting a wide variety of artists. “I would hope it is the first venue of choice for the Bruce Springsteens and the Bon Jovis and the Yo-Yo Mas and the Lang Langs, and at the same time it’s a place where we could have produced a “Hamilton” project or where we could produce a new ballet,” he said. He added that he was excited by the technological possibilities of the plans, which call for adding cutting-edge streaming capabilities that will allow the center to capture and disseminate performances in a much more immersive, sophisticated way than is done at most theaters.Mr. Perelman said that he had been particularly taken by the designs of the architect, Joshua Prince-Ramus, who was formerly a partner of Rem Koolhaas, and recalled a recent meeting in which they went over the renderings of the complex, which have not yet been publicly released, and then discussed the technological possibilities with Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the MIT Media Lab, who had been visiting Mr. Perelman on other business.The news that the performing arts center finally had a lead gift, and was likely to get built, is sure to cheer downtown residents who have long seen it as a priority, said Catherine McVay Hughes, the chairwoman of Community Board 1. “The community that stayed was steadfast in supporting a cultural component,” she said. “It was important that something alive gets created here, right here, at the World Trade Center site.”

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

Early life[edit]
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman.[5][6] He was raised in a Jewish family.[7] He managed with family members the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.[8]
From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business.[9] By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father's company. Raymond was a rough teacher, harshly criticizing Ronald for even the slightest misstep.[5] A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their relationship in detail.[10]
Perelman attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where he followed in his father's footsteps and majored in business. He graduated in 1964 and completed his master's in 1966.[11]
Business career[edit]
Belmont Industries[edit]
Perelman's first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.[12]
Throughout Perelman's tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on many other deals, earning millions of dollars in the process. Their general strategy was one Perelman would follow for the rest of his life, purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.[13]
MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated[edit]
Main article: MacAndrews & Forbes
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father's influence. He recognized the enormous value of Hatfield's mismanaged jewelry cache and bought control of the company with a $1.9 million loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company's retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.[14]
His next target was MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. The management and investors repeatedly rebuffed his efforts to purchase the company and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. That his father had tried and failed to acquire it 10 years earlier made his success particularly sweet.[15]
MacAndrews & Forbes has become a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies. Wholly owned by Perelman, who is chairman and chief executive officer, MacAndrews & Forbes invests in companies with strong market positions, recognized brands and growth potential. Current holdings include participants in a range of industries, from cosmetics and entertainment to biotechnology and military equipment, including AM General,[16] Deluxe,[17] Revlon,[18] Scientific Games,[19] SIGA Technologies[20] and VTV.[21]
He has done dozens of deals with Revlon Corporation,[22] thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank,[23][24] Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products,[25] and New World Entertainment.[26] He formerly owned Marvel Entertainment Group.[27]
The story of Perelman's Marvel adventures were caricatured in Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001)[28] by R. Walker and Josh Neufeld,[29] a comic book collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Perelman, with Mike Vranos, Al Dunlap, and Victor Niederhoffer among those included.
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[30] Two facts were at issue. Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[31] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[32] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[33] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[34] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[35] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[36] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[37] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[38]
Philanthropy and political donations[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes established the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program in 1994 for research into the causes and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The company also founded the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Medical Center. Over the years, MacAndrews & Forbes has also provided significant support for such organizations as the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, Carnegie Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and Perelman’s alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania.
In 1993, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Revlon Run/Walk For Women was created through the combined efforts of Perelman, Lily Tartikoff, co-founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and the EIF. The New York and Los Angeles Run/Walk events together have distributed over $50 million for women’s cancer research, counseling and outreach programs nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2006, Perelman donated over $60 million to various charitable groups and causes including Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial.[39] Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle,[40] $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology,[41] $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies,[42] and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum.[43]
In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.[44]
In 2008, the Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Perelman as the 26th largest donor in the U.S. That year, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford's Theatre.
Perelman pledged $25 million to Weill Medical College, in New York, to support research, education, and patient care at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine. Perelman also pledged $15 million to Stand Up to Cancer, a Pasadena, Calif., organization that supports cancer research and efforts to advance treatment for cancer patients; $5-million to the World Trade Center Memorial Fund, in New York; and $2.5 million to Ford's Theatre, in Washington.
Perelman also gave a total of $16 million to 581 nonprofit organizations, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, in Philadelphia; the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, in New York; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Baltimore; the Rainforest Foundation U.S., in New York; and other arts, education, Jewish, medical research, and women's-health groups. Perelman serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation's 40th Anniversary Gala [45] at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City – an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.
In August 2010, Perelman signed the Giving Pledge, committing up to half his assets to be designated for the benefit of charitable causes (after his family and children have been provided for).[citation needed]
Since 2010, Perelman has hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.[46] Richard Gere and Carey Lowell, George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Barbra Streisand have attended the events; performers have included Ben E. King, Sting, Bettye Lavette, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys and more. In 2016, the Apollo in the Hamptons event raised $5 million for the Apollo.,[47] and featured live music from The Roots, Joe Walsh, Gwen Stefani and Lionel Richie.
In 2011, Perelman's parents, Raymond and Ruth, donated $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,[48] the largest single donation to that university in its history, changing the school's name to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His mother, Ruth, died on July 31, 2011, at age 90 in Philadelphia.
In 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services.[49]
In 2013, Perelman donated $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments.[50]
In May 2013, Perelman donated $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.[51]
In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall.[3]
In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.[52]
In 2016, Perelman donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.[53] Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand is serving as Chairwoman of the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center.[54]
Controversy[edit]
Greenmail[edit]
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail.[55] "Greenmail" occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy.[56] Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.[57]
He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at 88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman's shares.[58]
Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.[59]
Monica Lewinsky[edit]
Perelman stumbled into the Lewinsky scandal. In early 1998, Vernon Jordan recommended Monica Lewinsky to Perelman as a potential employee, pitching her as a very smart young woman. While Jordan was on the Revlon board of directors, Jordan rarely spoke to Perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him. Jordan indicated he'd already talked about Lewinsky with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings vice president, Jaymie Durnan. Durnan told Perelman that he had determined there was no position available for Lewinsky at Perelman's company, but that he had forwarded Lewinsky's resume to Revlon. Perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the Lewinsky–Clinton connection later that month.[60] He found that Revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn, but it was too late; Revlon and Perelman were all over the scandal.[61]
Panavision[edit]
In April 2001, M&F Worldwide bought Perelman's 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&F Worldwide's other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts.[62] Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography.[63] The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&F Worldwide shareholders' lack of confidence.[64] Perelman tried to pacify M&F Worldwide's shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.[65]
Fred Tepperman[edit]
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman's seven-year stint at MacAndrews & Forbes. Tepperman's tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimers-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman's contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife's condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman's salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990[66] and partially from his large benefits package.[67] Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company's retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars.[66] It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages[edit]
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He wed socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006.[68] On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard-educated psychiatrist.
Faith Golding[edit]
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 while on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking, Faith Golding controlled a personal fortune of around $100 million at the time of their marriage.[69] They adopted three children named Steven, Josh, and Hope, and Faith gave birth to a fourth child named Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984 when Faith discovered Perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of Perelman's office. Faith threatened to scuttle Perelman's attempt to take MacAndrews & Forbes private in 1983 by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name. She further declared that Perelman defrauded the owners of the First Sterling Corporation (i.e. her) by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the company's money, and made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.[70]
Claudia Cohen[edit]




Ronald and Samantha Perelman


Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce.[71] Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million.[71] In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that he'd known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her.[72] In March 2008, Perelman decided to change the name of Logan Hall, located at the University of Pennsylvania, to Cohen Hall, after his late ex-wife.[73] He donated $20 million to the University to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and as part of his donation, he had the option to change the name of Logan Hall. His decision to rename Logan Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.[74]
Patricia Duff[edit]
Patricia Duff was Perelman's third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy.[75] After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism[76] and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place.[77] When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff.[78] Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues,[79] Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter,[80] and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party.[81] The judge's sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case,[78] but it's known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh's legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.[82]
Ellen Barkin[edit]




Ellen Barkin


Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in 1999.[83] After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin's acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin's yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million.[84] In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves.[85]
Anna Chapman[edit]
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006.[86] In August 2010, they announced they are expecting a baby—her first, his seventh—via a surrogate.[87] In October 2010, they were married.[88] Chapman is a convert to Judaism.[89] In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar.[90] The couple later had a second child in May 2012.
Judaism[edit]
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman's life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple,[91] and his father has donated millions to Conservative causes.[92] He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel.[82] "I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did".[82] Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer,[93] keeps a kosher home,[94] and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect.[93] He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism's best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.[82]
Homes[edit]




"Près Choisis" in 1905.


Perelman is the owner of "Près Choisis" (now called "The Creeks"), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
