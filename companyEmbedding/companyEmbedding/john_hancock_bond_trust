The past performance shown here reflects reinvested distributions and the beneficial effect of any expense reductions, and does not guarantee future results. Returns for periods shorter than one year are cumulative, and results for other share classes will vary. Shares will fluctuate in value and, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance cited.
Performance figures assume that all distributions are reinvested. POP (public offering price) figures for Class A shares reflect the maximum sales charge, which is 5.0% for equity, asset allocation, and alternative/specialty funds and 4.0% for fixed-income funds (reduced from 4.5%, effective 2/3/14), with the following exceptions: John Hancock Absolute Return Currency Fund and John Hancock Global Conservative Absolute Return Fund have a maximum sales charge of 3.0%, and John Hancock Floating Rate Income Fund and John Hancock Short Duration Credit Opportunities Fund have a maximum sales charge of 2.5% (reduced from 3.0% and 4.5%, respectively, effective 2/3/14). Performance quoted without sales charges would be reduced if the sales charges were applied. Performance for other share classes will vary. For money market funds, the yield quoted more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return performance shown. Sales charges do not apply to money market funds and as a result, those funds do not quote POP performance figures. The fund operating expenses are 0.93%.

         Morningstar Rating3



       Overall Rating
       


       As of 6/30/17 the Fund was rated 4 stars out of 856 funds, 5 stars out of 767 funds and 5 stars out of 540 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively.
       


       Overall Rating is based on the 3-, 5- and 10-year Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Returns and accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance. Other classes may be rated differently.
The funds have experienced negative performance for various time periods, including but not limited to, the three, five or ten-year periods for which the Morningstar "star" ratings are issued. 
For each managed product (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  The top 10.0% of funds in each category, the next 22.5%, 35.0%, 22.5%, and bottom 10.0% receive 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 star(s), respectively. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.  The rating formula most heavily weights the three year rating, using the following calculation: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
       












               
       
       What You Should Know
       
    





            

Fixed-income investments are subject to interest rate and credit risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise or if the creditor is unable or unwilling to make principal or interest payments. Investments in higher-yielding, lower-rated securities involve additional risks as these securities include a higher risk of default and loss of principal. Foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market's perception of issuer creditworthiness. The use of hedging and derivatives transactions could produce disproportionate gains or losses and may increase volatility and costs. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. The distribution amounts paid by the Fund generally depend on the amount of income and/or dividends received by the Fund’s investments. The Fund may not be able to pay distributions or may have to reduce its distribution level if the amount of such income and/or dividends received from its investment decline. Therefore, distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time. Certain market conditions, including reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, and rising interest rates, may impair liquidity, the ability of the fund to sell securities or close derivative positions at advantageous prices. For additional information on these and other risk considerations, please see the Fund's prospectus.

1 Performance results reflect any expense reductions. Without these reductions, performance would have been less favorable. 11/9/73 is the inception date for the oldest class of shares, Class A shares. Class I shares were first offered on 9/4/01; Class R6 shares were first offered on 9/1/11; Class R2 shares were first offered on 3/1/12; returns prior to these dates are those of Class A shares that have been recalculated to apply the gross fees and expenses of Class I, R6 and R2 shares. Class R4 shares were first offered on 3/27/15. The returns prior to this date are those of Class A shares that have been recalculated to reflect the gross fees and expenses of Class R4 shares.
2 As of most recent month end. The Morningstar Style Box™ reveals the fund’s investment style.

For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the long bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest-rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration.
 
Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information Morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). For a list of all NRSROs, please visit sec.gov. Additionally, Morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies. If two rating organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lower rating; if three or more organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the median rating, and in cases where there are more than two organization/agency ratings and a median rating does not exist, fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO or rating agency ratings can change from time to time.
 
For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve.
 
For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
3 Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance through the most recent month end. The ratings are subject to change every month.
