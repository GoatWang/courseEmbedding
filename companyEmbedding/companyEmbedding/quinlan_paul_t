Many facilities use a monthly base rate system which covers the cost of rent and a few core services such as meals, housekeeping and most utilities. Others may also require entrance fees, deposits and additional service fees. Understanding how prices are assessed at each potential facility is a crucial part of making a confident decision.It is also important to note that costs may increase as your loved one ages and requires additional assistive services. A care plan can help you assess these needs and related costs, and it should be evaluated and updated at least annually.Popular CitiesMonthly MedianMiami$2,181Baltimore$3,194Anchorage$5,491San Diego$3,268Tampa$3,250Los Angeles$3,238Milwaukee$3,123Portland$3,477San Francisco$3,683Seattle$3,727Cost Information Provided by Genworth 2015 Cost of Care SurveyFind Care In Your AreaEnter a location Select a categoryIn-Home CareAssisted LivingIndependent LivingMemory CareNursing HomesAdult Day CareSelect a StateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingChoosing Assisted LivingSelecting a senior living community for yourself or your loved one can be a complex decision.
