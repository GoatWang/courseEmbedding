Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners Closes Second Fund at $3.5 Billion 
      Hard Cap




Oversubscribed fund increases total firm assets under management 
      to $5.7 billion


Investment team remains focused on high-quality infrastructure 
      businesses in need of financial resources and operational expertise






January 11, 2016 03:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners (with its affiliates, “Stonepeak” or 
      the “Firm”), a North America-focused infrastructure investment firm, 
      today announced that it has completed fundraising for its second fund, 
      Stonepeak Infrastructure Fund II (“Fund II”) at its $3.5 billion hard 
      cap. The Firm received investor subscriptions at the first close well in 
      excess of the hard cap, with the entire fundraising process being 
      completed in six months.
    

      Trent Vichie, Stonepeak Co-Founder and Senior Managing Director, 
      commented: “We faced a relatively expensive market for infrastructure 
      assets during Fund I, meaning we had to be patient and come up with 
      different ways to create value. Ultimately, we built a number of core 
      infrastructure assets, such as the Carlsbad (California) Desalination 
      Plant, in preference to buying assets that others had developed. We 
      appreciate the confidence our investors have shown in our approach. Our 
      strategy has been rewarded with significant investor support for our 
      second fund and we look forward to pursuing the attractive opportunities 
      we see for Fund II.”
    

      Michael Dorrell, Stonepeak Co-Founder and Senior Managing Director, 
      stated: “We have witnessed a two-speed financial market over the past 
      six months, with cracks in energy, power and high-yield credit on the 
      one-hand, and strength (until very recently) in broader equity markets 
      on the other. We are pleased to be entering this market with significant 
      capital, where high quality infrastructure businesses are facing capital 
      shortages due to market dislocation. It is becoming a good time to 
      invest in operating infrastructure businesses, and if cracks continue to 
      widen, the situation for our investors will improve accordingly. We have 
      the right sized team and fund to continue to deploy capital and work 
      with management teams to drive increased value post investment. ”
    

      The majority of the capital commitments to Fund II came from investors 
      who also participated in Fund I. Stonepeak is extremely appreciative of 
      the strong support that Fund II received from investors. Stonepeak 
      believes that the size of Fund II aligns well with the investment 
      opportunities before it and with the interests of its limited partners.
    

      Campbell Lutyens served as exclusive global placement agent for Fund II, 
      and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as US legal counsel.
