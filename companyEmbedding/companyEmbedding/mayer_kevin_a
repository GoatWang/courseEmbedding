Highlights, News & Knowledge

 

Kevin C. Mayer is a partner and accomplished trial attorney with deep experience litigating on behalf of clients in a wide variety of complex commercial and mass tort actions. He counsels clients facing regulatory enforcement at both the state and federal level. He has litigated and tried cases in multiple federal, state, territorial and tribal courts, as well as before government agencies and administrative bodies. He is counsel-of-record in some of the most important appellate decisions assisting the defense in tort litigation over the past 25 years. His clients include members of the oil and chemical, sporting goods and fitness, energy, medical device, industrial and consumer products, manufacturing, and construction industries, and academic institutions. 
Kevin's trial record includes construction, toxic tort, OSHA, environmental, and products liability litigation. He has particular experience addressing complex scientific, medical, and technical issues, and preparing and examining expert witnesses in both deposition and trial settings for personal injury, wrongful death, and regulatory litigation. 
Kevin is a Fellow of The Litigation Counsel of America, the Trial Lawyers' Honor Society, and a much-sought speaker and author on litigation and trial practice. He also serves on the firm's Public Service Committee. Kevin is dedicated to pro bono work and is a recipient of the 2015 Bet Tzedek Pro Bono Justice Award for consistently providing counsel to eligible, needy residents throughout Los Angeles County.
Tort / Products Liability
Kevin is well-known for his trial work on behalf of American and multinational companies in toxic tort and products liability litigation. His experience includes evaluation of issues involving cancer, systemic diseases, birth defects, dysmorphological and genetic consequences, immune and endocrine system dysfunction, and Legionnaire’s Disease, Toxic Shock Syndrome, and other pathogen-borne injuries. His work emphasizes epidemiology, pharmacology, toxicology, product labeling and warnings, industrial hygiene, regulatory compliance, and process safety management. Kevin's clients include upstream and downstream petroleum companies, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and the manufacturers and users of industrial, commercial, and consumer-grade chemical and mineral products.  
Environmental
Kevin represents land owners and operators in federal CERCLA and RCRA and state statutory and common law administrative proceedings, litigation and trials involving environmental contamination, cost-allocation, leaking underground storage tanks, waste disposal practices, and commercial development. His experience includes solid and liquid waste management, regulatory compliance and enforcement, Superfund, hydraulic fracturing, fear of future disease, risk assessment, Brownfields, and soils, air, and groundwater contamination investigation and remediation.
Regulatory Enforcement
Kevin counsels clients and handles civil and administrative law trials and appeals for industrial and commercial entities' alleged violations of the federal and states' OSHA, federal and state environmental statutes and regulations, and California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). He has tried numerous OSHA citation appeals for refining and industrial facilities involving alleged violations of Labor Code and Health & Safety Code standards for work place safety. He counsels clients on Proposition 65 statutory compliance and the emerging "Green Chemistry" regulations in California and throughout the country.
Construction
Kevin represents national architectural and engineering firms, developers, contractors, and facility owners in professional negligence, premises liability, construction defect, and contract actions involving public works projects, office buildings, theaters, athletic arenas and stadiums, condominiums, apartments, and custom homes. He serves as both plaintiff and defense counsel in these engagements. 
Traumatic Brain Injury
Since 2013, Kevin has developed particular experience on the tort liability issues arising from concussions and other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) associated with youth, high school and collegiate athletics, and has counseled multiple clients on the current state of medical and scientific knowledge concerning the diagnosis and treatment of TBIs, and "return to play" and "return to classroom" protocols.  Kevin has delivered seminars and webinars on the legal aspects of TBI, and has established relationships with some of the country’s most respected and sophisticated physicians and risk management experts on these issues.

Many drugs, including the arthritis drug Vioxx and diet aids containing Phenylpropanolamine, are considered dangerous products, as are some medical devices (heart defibrillators) and ordinary appliances (space heaters). Asbestos and tobacco are also considered inherently dangerous. A defective and dangerous products lawyer discovers how and why a product was defective, whether insurance policies will pay for your losses based on product liability laws, and what you can expect to recover in damages.Defective and dangerous products lawyers in cities near Los Angeles, CAGlendaleLa PuenteLakewoodLong BeachLos AngelesNorth HollywoodNorthridgePasadenaSanta ClaritaTorranceVan NuysWhittierSee all cities in California Nearby attorneys in related practice areasPersonal Injury Lawyers 90024Wrongful Death Attorneys 90024Class Action Attorneys 90024Litigation Lawyers 90024See all practice areas Los Angeles, CA attorneys by top languagesSpanishMandarinSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave
