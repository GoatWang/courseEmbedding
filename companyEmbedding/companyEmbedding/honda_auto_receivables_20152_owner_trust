                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

 

Each Note shall be dated the date of
its authentication. The terms of the Notes are the terms of this
Indenture.

 

Section
2.02.         
Execution, Authentication and Delivery . The Notes shall be
executed on behalf of the Issuer by any of its Authorized Officers.
The signature of any such Authorized Officer on the Notes may be
manual or facsimile. Notes bearing the manual or facsimile

No Note shall be entitled to any
benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose, unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Indenture Trustee by the manual signature of one of
its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Note
shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

 

Section
2.03.         
Temporary Notes . Pending the preparation of Definitive
Notes pursuant to Section 2.11, the Issuer may execute, and upon
receipt of an Issuer Order the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, temporary Notes that are printed, lithographed,
typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, of the tenor of
the Definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued and with such
variations not inconsistent with the terms of this Indenture as the
officers executing such Notes may determine, as evidenced by their
execution of such Notes.

 

If temporary Notes are issued, the
Issuer shall cause Definitive Notes to be prepared without
unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the
temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon
surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency of the
Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.02, without charge
to the related Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one
or more temporary Notes, the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor, a like tenor and principal amount of Definitive Notes of
authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes
shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as Definitive Notes.

 

Section
2.04.          Note
Register, Registration of Transfer and Exchange . The Issuer
shall cause to be kept a register (the “ Note Register
”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration of Notes
and the registration of all transfers of Notes. The Indenture
Trustee initially shall be the “Note Registrar” for the
purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein
provided. Upon any resignation of any Note Registrar, the Issuer
shall promptly appoint a successor or, if it elects not to make
such an appointment, assume the duties of Note
Registrar.

 

If a Person other than the Indenture
Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the Issuer
will give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of the
appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, and any
change in the location, of the Note Register, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all
reasonable times and to obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate executed on
behalf of the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to
the names and addresses of the Holders of the Notes and the
principal amounts and number of such Notes.

 

Upon surrender for registration of
transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the Issuer to be
maintained as provided in Section 3.02, provided that the
requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Issuer shall
execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the
Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture Trustee, in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of
the same Class in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount.

 




 



11



 






 


 

At the option of the Holder, Notes
may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange,
provided that the requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met
(as determined by the Issuer), the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall
obtain from the Indenture Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

 

All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

 

Every Note presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by,
or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing,
with such signature guaranteed by an “eligible guarantor
institution” meeting the requirements of the Note Registrar,
which requirements include membership or participation in the
Securities Transfer Agent’s Medallion Program (“
STAMP ”) or such other “signature guarantee
program” as may be determined by the Note Registrar in
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, all in accordance with
the Exchange Act.

 

No service charge shall be made to a
Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.03 or
9.06 not involving any transfer.

 

The preceding provisions of this
Section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to make
and the Note Registrar need not register transfers or exchanges of
Notes selected for redemption or of any Note for a period of 15
days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to the
Note.

Section
2.04A.           
Transfer Restrictions on the Class A-1 Notes .

 

(a)          On
the Closing Date, 100% of the Class A-1 Notes will be registered in
the name of the Depositor and issued in physical form as a
Definitive Note in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto. No transfer of a
Class A-1 Note, other than to an Affiliate of the Depositor, shall
be made unless such transfer is made pursuant to, (i) an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act and any applicable
state securities laws or, (ii) is exempt from the registration
requirements under the Securities Act and such state securities
laws. Except in the case of a transfer by the Depositor to an
Affiliate, in the event that a transfer is to be made in reliance
upon an exemption from the Securities Act and state securities
laws, in order to assure compliance with the Securities Act and
such laws, the Noteholder desiring to effect such transfer and such
Noteholder’s prospective transferee shall each certify to the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor in writing the
facts surrounding the transfer in substantially the forms set forth
in Exhibit C (the “Transferor Certificate”) and Exhibit
D (the “Investment Letter”). Except in the case of a
transfer by the Depositor to an Affiliate, there shall also be
delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption
from the Securities Act and state securities laws, which Opinion of
Counsel shall not be an expense of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee; provided that such Opinion of Counsel in respect of the
applicable state securities laws may be a memorandum of law rather
than an opinion if such counsel is not licensed in the applicable
jurisdiction. If the Depositor subsequently transfers any of the
Class A-1 Notes in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2)
thereof and any Noteholder intends to transfer the Class A-1 Notes
pursuant to Rule 144A, the Depositor shall provide to any
Noteholder and any prospective transferee designated by any such
Noteholder information regarding the Class A-1 Notes and the
Receivables and such other information as shall be necessary to
satisfy the condition to eligibility set forth in Rule 144A(d)(4)
for transfer of any such Class A-1 Notes without registration
thereof under the Securities Act pursuant to the registration
exemption provided by Rule 144A, in each case with the cost of the
provision of such information to be borne by the requesting
noteholder. Each Noteholder desiring to effect such a transfer
shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee, the Depositor and AHFC (in any capacity) against
any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or
is not made in accordance with federal and state securities
laws.

 

(b)          The
Class A-1 Notes issued to and held by the Depositor or its
Affiliates may not be sold, pledged, or other transferred unless
counsel satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee has rendered an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such Class A-1 Notes to be
sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred by the Depositor or its
Affiliates will be characterized as indebtedness for United States
federal income tax purposes after such sale, pledge, or other
transfer. Any attempted sale, pledge, or other transfer in
contravention of this Section 2.04A will be void ab
initio and the purported transferor will continue to be treated
as the owner of the Class A-1 Notes.

 

(c)          By
directly or indirectly acquiring a Class A-1 Note in a transaction
pursuant to Rule 144A, each initial purchaser, transferee and owner
of an ownership or beneficial interest will be required to
represent, warrant and agree (if in Definitive Note form) or will
be deemed to represent, warrant and agree (if in Book Entry Note
form) as follows:

 




 



13



 






 


 

(i)          it
understands that the Class A-1 Notes have not been registered under
the Securities Act, but were retained by the Depositor, and may not
be sold except as permitted in the following sentence. It
understands and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of any
accounts for which it is acting as hereinafter stated,
(x) that such Class A-1 Notes are being offered only in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of
the Securities Act and (y) that such Class A-1 Notes may be
resold, pledged or transferred only (i) to the Depositor or an
Affiliate, (ii) to an “accredited investor” as
defined in Rule 501(a)(1),(2),(3) or (7) of Regulation D under
the Securities Act (an “Accredited Investor”) acting
for its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a
fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are Accredited
Investors unless the holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary
capacity) that executes a certificate substantially in the form of
the Investment Letter, (iii) so long as such Class A-1 Note is
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
to a person whom it reasonably believes after due inquiry is a
“qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule
144A, acting for its own account (and not for the account of
others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also
are “qualified institutional buyers”) to whom notice is
given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance
on Rule 144A or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made
in a transaction otherwise exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, in which case the Indenture
Trustee shall require that both the prospective transferor and the
prospective transferee certify to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor in writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which
certification shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor. Except in the case of a transfer described in clauses
(i) or (iii) above, the Indenture Trustee shall require
that a written Opinion of Counsel (which will not be at the expense
of the Depositor, any affiliate of the Depositor or the Indenture
Trustee), reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Depositor, be delivered to the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor to the effect that such
transfer will not violate the Securities Act, and will be effected
in accordance with any applicable securities laws of each state of
the United States. It will notify any purchaser of the Class A-1
Notes from it of the above resale restrictions, if then applicable.
It further understands that in connection with any transfer of the
Class A-1 Notes by it that the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and
the Depositor may request, and if so requested it will furnish,
such certificates and other information as they may reasonably
require to confirm that any such transfer complies with the
foregoing restrictions;

 

(ii)         if
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, it is a “qualified
institutional buyer” as defined under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and is acquiring the Class A-1 Notes for its own
account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or
agent for others (which others also are “qualified
institutional buyers”). It is familiar with Rule 144A under
the Securities Act and is aware that the seller of the Class A-1
Notes and other parties intend to rely on the foregoing
representations, warranties and acknowledgements and the exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided
by Rule 144A;

 

(iii)        if
in Definitive Note form, it satisfies the requirements of Section
2.14 of this Indenture;

 

(iv)        it
understands that the Indenture Trustee, the Depositor and others
will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing
acknowledgments, representations and agreements, and it agrees that
if any of the acknowledgments, representations and warranties
deemed to have been made by it by its purchase of the Class A-1
Notes, for its own account or for one or more accounts as to each
of which it exercises sole investment discretion, are no longer
accurate, it shall promptly notify the Depositor; and

 

(v)         the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor are entitled to rely upon the
foregoing representations, warranties and acknowledgements and are
irrevocably authorized to produce the foregoing representations,
warranties and acknowledgments or a copy hereof to any interested
party in any administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry
with respect to the matters covered hereby.

Section
2.05.         
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes . If (i) any
mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the
Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Note, (ii) there is delivered to
the Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required
by it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless and
(iii) the requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, then,
in the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a Protected
Purchaser, the Issuer shall execute, and upon its written request
the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Note, a replacement Note of the same Class; provided, however, that
if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated
Note, shall have become or within seven days shall be due and
payable, or shall have been called for redemption, instead of
issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such destroyed, lost
or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption Date
without surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such
replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note
pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, a Protected
Purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement
Note was issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover such
replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to whom it was
delivered or any Person taking such replacement Note from such
Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or any assignee
of such Person, except a protected purchaser, and shall be entitled
to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the
extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer
or the Indenture Trustee in connection therewith.

 

Upon the issuance of any replacement
Note under this Section, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may
require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee or the Note
Registrar) connected therewith.

 

Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

 

The provisions of this Section are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

 

Section
2.06.         
Persons Deemed Owner . Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer of any Note, the Issuer, the Indenture

whose name any Note is registered (as of the day of determination)
as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of
principal of and interest, if any, on such Note and for all other
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and none
of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any of their respective

installment of interest or principal, if any, payable on any Note
that is punctually paid or duly provided for by the Issuer on the

such Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered on the
Record Date by check mailed first-class postage prepaid to such
Person’s address as it appears on the Note Register on such
Record Date, except that, unless Definitive Notes have been issued
pursuant to Section 2.11, with respect to Notes registered on the
Record Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency
(initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.), payment will be
made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account
designated by such nominee and except for the final installment of
principal payable with respect to such Note on a Payment Date, a
Redemption Date or on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date, as

called for redemption pursuant to Section 10.01), which shall be
payable as provided below. The funds represented by any such checks
returned undelivered shall be held in accordance with Section
3.03.

 

(b)          The
principal of each Note shall be payable as provided in Section
8.02(d) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes shall be due and payable, if not
previously paid, on the related Final Payment Date or the date on
which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if
the Indenture Trustee or Holders of the Notes representing not less
than a majority of the Outstanding Amount have declared the Notes
to be immediately due and payable in the manner provided in Section
5.02. All principal payments on each Class of Notes shall be made
pro rata to the Noteholders of such Class entitled thereto. The
Indenture Trustee shall notify the Person in whose name a Note is

Payment Date and shall specify that such final installment will be
payable only upon presentation and surrender of such Note and shall
specify the place where such Note may be presented and surrendered
for payment of such installment. Notices in connection with
redemptions of Notes shall be mailed to Noteholders as provided in
Section 10.02. In addition, the Administrator shall notify each
Rating Agency upon the final payment of interest and principal of
each Class of Notes, and upon the termination of the Trust, in each
case pursuant to Section 1.02(a)(iii) of the Administration
Agreement.

 

(c)          If
the Issuer defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, the
Issuer shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such
defaulted interest to the extent lawful) at the applicable Interest
Rate in any lawful manner. The Issuer may pay such defaulted
interest to the Persons who are Noteholders on a subsequent special
record date, which date shall be at least 5 Business Days prior to
the next payment date. The Issuer shall fix or cause to be fixed
any such special record date and related payment date, and, at
least 15 days before any such special record date, the Issuer shall
mail to each Noteholder a notice that states the special record
date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be
paid.

 

Section
2.08.         
Cancellation . All Notes surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer, exchange or redemption shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled
by the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer may at any time deliver to the
Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall
be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as
provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
Indenture. All cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of by the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention or
disposal policy as in effect at the time unless the Issuer shall
direct by an Issuer Order that they be destroyed or returned to it;
provided, that such Issuer Order is timely and the Notes have not
been previously disposed of by the Indenture Trustee.

Section
2.09.         
Book-Entry Notes . Except as provided in Section 2.11, the
Notes, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of a
typewritten Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes, to be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee, as agent for The Depository
Trust Company, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of,
the Issuer. The Book-Entry Notes shall be registered initially on
the Note Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the
initial Clearing Agency, and no Note Owner will receive a
definitive Note representing such Note Owner’s interest in
such Note, except as provided in Section 2.11. Unless and until
definitive, fully registered Notes (the “ Definitive
Notes ”) have been issued to such Note Owners pursuant to
Section 2.11:

 

(i)          the
provisions of this Section shall be in full force and
effect;

 

(ii)         the
Note Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal
with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Indenture
(including the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes
and the giving of instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole
holder of the Notes, and shall have no obligation to the Note
Owners;

 

(iii)        to
the extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any
other provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section
shall control;

 

(iv)        the
rights of Note Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing
Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and
agreements between such Note Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or
the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Note Depository
Agreement, unless and until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to
Section 2.11, the Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers
among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit
payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to such Clearing
Agency Participants; and

 

(v)         whenever
this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Holders of Notes evidencing a
specified percentage of the Outstanding Amount, the Clearing Agency
shall be deemed to represent such percentage only to the extent
that it has received instructions to such effect from Note Owners
and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing,
respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest
in the Notes and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture
Trustee.

Section
2.10.         
Notices to Clearing Agency . Whenever a notice or other
communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture,
unless and until Definitive Notes shall have been issued to such
Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.11, the Indenture Trustee shall
give all such notices and communications specified herein to be
given to Holders of the Notes to the Clearing Agency, and shall
have no obligation to such Note Owners.

 

Section
2.11.         
Definitive Notes . On the Closing Date, all of the Class A-1
Notes will be issued in physical form as the form of Definitive
Notes, in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto and registered in the name
of the Depositor. The Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the
Class A-4 Notes will be issued on the Closing Date as Book-Entry
Notes; however, if at anytime, (i)(A) the Administrator advises the
Indenture Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer
willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with
respect to the Book-Entry Notes and (B) neither the Indenture
Trustee nor the Administrator is able to locate a qualified
successor, (ii) the Administrator at its option advises the
Indenture Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or (iii) after the
occurrence of an Event of Default or a Servicer Default, Owners of
Book-Entry Notes representing beneficial interests aggregating at
least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of such Notes advise the
Indenture Trustee and the Clearing Agency Participants through the
Clearing Agency, in writing that the continuation of a book-entry
system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best
interests of such Note Owners, then, in each case, the Indenture
Trustee shall notify all Note Owners of the related Class of Notes
through the Clearing Agency of the occurrence of any such event and
of the availability of Definitive Notes of the related Class of
Notes to Note Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the
Indenture Trustee of the Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry
Notes by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration
instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate the Definitive Notes in accordance with the
instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer, the Note
Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in
delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and
shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the
issuance of Definitive Notes of a Class, the Indenture Trustee
shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes as Noteholders
hereunder. Subsequent Noteholders of the Class A-1 Notes that are
unaffiliated with the Depositor shall have the right, but at such
Noteholders sole cost and expense, to request that the Class A-1
Notes be converted to Book Entry Notes and the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the Depositor agree
to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to effect such

2.14.         
Employee Benefit Plans . The transfer of a Definitive Note
shall not be registered unless the prospective transferee has
represented in writing to the Indenture Trustee that either (i) it
is not a Benefit Plan or any other plan subject to a law that is
substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code (“Similar Law”) and is not acting on behalf of or
investing the assets of a Benefit Plan or any other plan subject to
Similar Law or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of the
Definitive Note will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
because it will be covered by a United States Department of Labor
prohibited transaction class exemption or by some other applicable
statutory or administrative exemption and will not cause a
nonexempt violation of any Similar Law. Any Person that acquires a
beneficial interest in a Book-Entry Note with the assets of a

shall fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee with the address
thereof, such surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served
at the Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints the
Indenture Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders,

Sections 5.04 and 8.02, all payments of amounts due and payable
with respect to any Notes that are to be made from amounts

the Issuer except as provided in this Section.

 

On or before the Business Day

Issuer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Collection
Account (to be transferred to the Note Distribution Account on the
related Payment Date) an aggregate sum sufficient to pay the

trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless
the Paying Agent is the Indenture Trustee) shall promptly notify
the Indenture Trustee in writing of its action or failure so to
act.

 

The Issuer will cause each Paying
Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture
Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees), subject to the
provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

 

(i)          hold
all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to
the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein
provided;

the Indenture Trustee notice of any default by the Issuer (or any
other obligor upon the Notes) of which it has actual knowledge in
the making of any payment required to be made with respect to the
Notes;

 

(iii)        at
any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the
Indenture Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying
Agent;

 

(iv)        immediately
resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee
all sums held by it in trust for the payment of Notes if at any
time it ceases to meet the standards required to be met by a Paying
Agent at the time of its appointment; and

 

(v)         comply
with all requirements of the Code with respect to the withholding
from any payments made by it on any Notes of any applicable
withholding taxes imposed thereon and with respect to any
applicable reporting requirements in connection
therewith.

 

The Issuer may at any time, for the
purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct any
Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust
by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such
Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.

from such trust and be paid to the Issuer on Issuer Request; and
the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general
creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof (but only to
the extent of the amounts so paid to the Issuer), and all liability
of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such
trust money shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to
make any such repayment, shall at the expense and written direction
of the Issuer cause to be published once, in a newspaper published
in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day
and of general circulation in The City of New York, notice that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified
therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such
publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining
will be repaid to or for the account of the Issuer. The Indenture
Trustee shall also adopt and employ, at the expense and written
direction of the Issuer, any other reasonable means of notification
of such repayment (including, but not limited to, mailing notice of
such repayment to Holders whose Notes have been called but have not
been surrendered for redemption or whose right to or interest in
monies due and payable but not claimed is determinable from the
records of the Indenture Trustee or of any Paying Agent, at the
last address of record for each such Holder).

existence, rights and franchises as a statutory trust under the

Issuer hereunder is or becomes, organized under the laws of any
other State or of the United States, in which case the Issuer will
keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchises under the
laws of such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and preserve its

Section
3.05.         
Protection of Owner Trust Estate . The Issuer intends the
security interest Granted pursuant to this Indenture in favor of
the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders to be prior to
all other liens in respect of the Owner Trust Estate, and the
Issuer shall take all actions necessary to obtain and maintain, for
the benefit of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders,
a first lien on and a first priority, perfected security interest
in the Owner Trust Estate. The Issuer will from time to time
execute and deliver all such supplements and amendments hereto and

financing statements and continuation statements have been executed
and filed that are necessary to create and continue the Indenture
Trustee’s first priority perfected security interest in the
collateral for the benefit of the Noteholders, and reciting the
details of such filings or referring to prior Opinions of Counsel
in which such details are given, or (ii) no such action shall be
necessary to perfect such security interest.

 

(b)          Within
90 days after the beginning of each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the first fiscal year beginning more than three
months after the Cutoff Date, the Issuer shall furnish to the

perfected security interest in the collateral for the benefit of
the Noteholders, and reciting the details of such filings or
referring to prior Opinions of Counsel in which such details are
given, or (ii) no such action shall be necessary to perfect such
security interest.

 

Section
3.07.         
Performance of Obligations; Servicing of Receivables
.

 

(a)          The
Issuer will not take any action and will use its best efforts not
to permit any action to be taken by others that would release any
Person from any of such Person’s material covenants or
obligations under any instrument or agreement included in the Owner
Trust Estate or that would result in the amendment, hypothecation,
subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the validity
or effectiveness of, any such instrument or agreement, except as
expressly provided in this Indenture, the other Basic Documents or
such other instrument or agreement.

 

(b)          The
Issuer may contract with other Persons to assist it in performing
its duties under this Indenture, and any performance of such duties
by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an
Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be
action taken by the Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted
with the Servicer and the Administrator to assist the Issuer in
performing its duties under this Indenture.




 



22



 






 


 
 

(c)          The
Issuer will and will cause the Administrator to, punctually perform
and observe all of its obligations and agreements contained in this
Indenture, the other Basic Documents and in the instruments and
agreements included in the Owner Trust Estate, including but not
limited to filing or causing to be filed all UCC financing
statements and continuation statements required to be filed by the
terms of this Indenture and the other Basic Documents in accordance
with and within the time periods provided for herein and therein.
Except as otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuer shall
not waive, amend, modify, supplement or terminate any Basic
Document or any provision thereof without the written consent of
the Indenture Trustee or the Holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount or such greater percentage as may be specified
in the particular provision.

 

(d)          If
the Issuer shall have knowledge of the occurrence of a Servicer
Default, the Issuer shall promptly provide written notice to a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee and to the
Administrator thereof, and shall specify in such notice the action,
if any, the Issuer is taking with respect of such default. If a
Servicer Default shall arise from the failure of the Servicer to
perform any of its duties or obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer
shall take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure. The Administrator shall, in accordance with Section
1.02(c) of the Administration Agreement, make such notice available
to each Rating Agency.

 

(e)          As
promptly as possible after the giving of notice of termination to
the Servicer of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to
Section 7.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture
Trustee shall appoint a Successor Servicer, and such Successor
Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a
form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee. In the event that a
Successor Servicer has not been appointed and accepted its
appointment at the time when the Servicer ceases to act as
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer. The Indenture
Trustee may resign as the Servicer by giving written notice of such
resignation to the Issuer and in such event will be released from
such duties and obligations, such release not to be effective until
the date a new servicer enters into a servicing agreement as
provided below. Upon delivery of any such notice to the Issuer, the
Issuer shall obtain a new servicer as the Successor Servicer under
the Sale and Servicing Agreement. Any Successor Servicer other than
the Indenture Trustee shall (i) be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of motor vehicle
receivables and (ii) enter into a servicing agreement with the
Issuer and the Seller having substantially the same provisions as
the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to
the Servicer. If within 30 days after the delivery of the notice
referred to above, the Issuer shall not have obtained such a new
servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or may petition a
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a Successor Servicer.
In connection with any such appointment, the Issuer may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor as it and such
successor shall agree, subject to the limitations set forth below
and in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and in accordance with
Section 7.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer and
the Seller shall enter into an agreement with such successor for
the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement to be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee). If the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s duties as servicer of
the Receivables as provided herein, it shall do so in its
individual capacity and not in its capacity as Indenture Trustee
and, accordingly, the provisions of Article Six shall be
inapplicable (except as set forth in the proviso contained in
Section 6.01(a)) to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the Receivables. In
case the Indenture Trustee shall become successor to the Servicer
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to appoint as Servicer any one of its Affiliates or
agents, provided that it shall be fully liable for the actions and
omissions of such Affiliate or agent in such capacity as Successor
Servicer.

 




 



23



 






 


 

(f)          Upon
any termination of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall promptly
notify a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee. As soon as a
Successor Servicer is appointed, the Issuer shall notify the
Indenture Trustee of such appointment, specifying in such notice
the name and address of such Successor Servicer.

 

Section
3.08.

the Issuer shall not:

 

(i)          except

properties or assets of the Issuer, including those included in the
Owner Trust Estate, unless directed to do so by the Indenture
Trustee;

or assert any claim against any present or former Noteholder by
reason of the payment of the taxes levied or assessed upon any part
of the Owner Trust Estate;

 

(iii)        (A)
permit the validity or effectiveness of this Indenture to be
impaired, or permit the lien created by this Indenture to be

permit any Person to be released from any covenants or obligations
with respect to the Notes under this Indenture except as may be
expressly permitted hereby, (B) permit any lien, charge, excise,
claim, security interest, mortgage or other encumbrance (other than
the lien of this Indenture) to be created on or extend to or
otherwise arise upon or burden the Owner Trust Estate or any part
thereof or any interest therein or the proceeds thereof (other than
tax liens, mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by
operation of law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and
arising solely as a result of an action or omission of the related
Obligor) or (C) permit the lien created by this Indenture not to
constitute a valid first priority (other than with respect to any
such tax, mechanics’ or other lien) security interest in the
Owner Trust Estate; or

 

(iv)        dissolve
or liquidate in whole or in part.

Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes and Certificates
as would have become due if the Notes and Certificates had not been

maintain possession of the Owner Trust Estate, the Indenture
Trustee may, but need not, obtain, at the expense of the Issuer,
and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or
accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of
such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Owner Trust
Estate for such purpose.
