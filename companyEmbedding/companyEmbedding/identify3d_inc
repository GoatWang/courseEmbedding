Laminating Equipment » About Us
About Leading Manufacturer of Roll Laminators

KLAI-Co Identification Products, Inc. is proud to say that we are a US based manufacturer.
KLA-Co Identification Products, Inc. was founded in 2003 by Mark Klainos, it current CEO and President, after acquiring Westec, Inc. Westec was a manufacturer of film based photo identification cameras that used Polaroid and Fuji instant films. KLAI-Co's core focus initially was on manufacturing cameras but quickly shifted into other targeted product sectors as instant film based systems became obsolete as technology evolved and customers moved to digital/computer based ID systems.  KLAI-Co specialized in manufacturing, integrating, and distributing through a focused dealer network, an instant cameras line that included passport cameras, identification cameras, photo cutters, and industrial pouch laminators used for sealing ID cards. As a result of our continuous desire to meet customers' wants and needs, we were asked to expand our product offerings to include digital passport systems, pouch laminators, roll laminators, pouch lamination, roll lamination, binding machines, binding supplies, paper trimmers, cover stock materials, and other document finishing related products. In the process, we also developed a strong network of OEM partners around the globe that has helped innovate and develop products that fit our customers' ever-changing requirements. 


How did KLAI-Co become a manufacturer of Roll Laminators?  Long story short, in 2013, after the passing of Roy Cook, former product designer and owner of Banner America and Laminating Specialties, Inc., KLAI-Co began manufacturing "LSI" roll laminators. These laminators are based on Roy's legacy design focusing primarily on 27" and 40" roll laminators used specifically to meet the volume needs of schools, offices, government agencies, and on-demand copy & print centers. In late 2014, we embarked on a complete redesign of the laminator line that incorporated major updates to Roy's mechanical design with state of the art electronic controls. We are proud to say we now offer of a full line of feature rich roll laminators that are user friendly, mount foam boards/thicker material without using a roller nip control (operator handle to open and close rollers), and all of our 27" machines ship by common carrier (FedEx or UPS) instead of by LTL (Truck). In late 2015, in partnership with ArtGraphix/Stover Graphics, we launched 27" and 40" versions of a new mounting laminator under their SmoothMount brand name.
A special thanks goes out to Michael Klainos, a native of Greece, who founded Identification Products Mfg. Co. in 1974.  Michael, father to Mark and an electrical and mechanical engineering by education, provided the foundation and guidance needed for Mark and KLAI-Co Identification Products, Inc. to continue the family tradition of being industry leaders and innovators.
WE ARE PROUD TO SAY WE ARE A FAMILY OWNED AND OPERATED CORPORATION.

Identify3D Closes Multi-Million Investment Round Led by SoftTech for Market Expansion, Partner Integration in Digital Manufacturing

Identify3D to Expand Market Growth in Securing of Intellectual Property, Manufacturing Integrity Along the Digital Thread







Advanced Manufacturing has the potential to be a game changer for the $13 trillion manufacturing sector”, says Andy McLoughlin, Partner with the lead VC firm SoftTech.


San Francisco, CA (PRWEB)
March 08, 2017
 Identify3D, Inc., today announced it has completed its multi-million Series Seed investment round led by SoftTech VC. Among other investors participating in the round are the pre-seed lead investor Bee Partners, and international investors including Siemens Venture Capital GmbH, which is now a part of next47, the venture capital, advisor and catalyst into Siemens for external startups, La Famiglia, whose LP’s include large European Industrial families such as Krohne, Miele and Viessman, and DART Capital Partners, an Australian based  venture capital group focused on Digital and Additive Manufacturing opportunities.  Capital raised will help the company meet demand from its existing customer base in aerospace and defense and expand to meet the needs of other advanced manufacturing sectors including power generation, oil and gas, transportation and healthcare.  
“Manufacturers have embraced digital manufacturing as an efficient way to bring innovation and efficiency in product manufacturing,” said Joe Inkenbrandt, Co-Founder and CEO of Identify3D.  “But along the digital manufacturing thread, companies are vulnerable to issues of quality assurance and the potential theft of intellectual property.  Securing the digital thread from prototype to finished product is critical, and our recent round of funding will enable us to further develop our solution by integrating with other CAD/PLM, OEMs and technology partners and meet the needs of our clients.”
The Identify3D platform empower manufacturers to take advantage of the benefits of digital manufacturing, such as subtractive CNC machines or additive industrial 3D printers. Identify3D protects product data, enforces business and manufacturing rules through licensing, and securely reports production data.  The platform enables manufacturers to secure and trace the IP along the digital thread from designs to movement of physical parts to unlock proﬁt and protect competitive advantage.
“Advanced Manufacturing has the potential to be a game changer for the $13 trillion manufacturing sector,” says Andy McLoughlin, Partner with the lead VC firm SoftTech. “However, its successful deployment will require protection of IP, repeatability of the manufacturing process and secured flow of data from design to production - key challenges that Identify3D addresses. We are very impressed with the team and traction achieved to date, and are very excited to back an industry-defining company.” 
According to analyst firm Research and Markets the global digital manufacturing market will grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the period 2016-2020.  The majority of that growth stems from the adoption of digital manufacturing into the supply chain in aerospace, defense and medical devices.
“Identify3D provides design protection, quality assurance, and secure data distribution for digital manufacturing. They are experts in data distribution and Digital Rights Managements ensuring security and integrity of data along the complete manufacturing value chain – from design to the final product,” said Uwe Ruttkamp, Head of Business Segment Machine Tools Systems at Siemens. “We selected Identify 3D based on their outstanding approach and proven expertise in security and digital rights management, which will gain more and more importance in various industries.” 
“We found them to be unique in the space and are very happy to partner with Identify3D,” added Ulrich Warmbier, Vice President of Product and Portfolio Management Machine Tool Systems. “Identify3D enables industrial designers to encrypt designs and couple them with business and production rules to securely manage digital manufacturing ecosystems.”
Said Stephan Thomas, co-founder and Head of Business Development, “By protecting and securing the design and IP for our customers, we are helping to advance our shared vision that all manufactured products in the future will have digital components.  Integrity of both the design and the manufacturing process itself are fundamental requirements as we shift to a digital world, and we believe that Identify3D is well-positioned with our financial and strategic partners to continue to fuel that vision.”
