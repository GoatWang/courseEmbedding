Endurance International Group (EIG), formerly BizLand, is a web hosting company. The company was founded in 1997, and is headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts.[1] It achieved its size by acquiring a large number of smaller companies, which it continues to operate under the original brand names.[2]
In 2011, Endurance was bought from Accel-KKR by Warburg Pincus and GS Capital Partners, for around $975 million.[3] In September 2013, the company announced plans to raise $400 million in an IPO.[4] The company announced it would list on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol EIGI.[5] It went public in October 2013 raising $252 million selling shares to the public at $12 each. This was below the company's target goal of $400  million.[6][7]
In a 2015 investor earnings conference call, the company reported having 4.2 million worldwide users.[8]
This path to increased size is similar to the path networking company Verio followed in the 1990s, using free cash flow and access to capital markets [9] in acquiring assets to add to their corporate portfolio.[10] The concept was to roll up small ISPs into one large national ISP and achieve economies of scale. Endurance is acquiring hosting companies domestically and internationally.[2]
Blake Cunneen, Endurance's senior vice president of corporate development has stated:

"Investing in mergers and acquisitions is a very accretive use of free cash flow and going forward we'll continue to do so. We don't have any deals we're announcing. But we told the Street to expect M&A growth to continue."[11]

The company made four buys in 2014. The biggest being a $109.8 million cash and stock deal for the web presence business of Directi from Indian-based Directi Web Technologies. Directi provides services in various countries, including India, the U.S., Turkey, China, Russia and Indonesia.[11]
In March 2015, the company announced an investment in Netherlands-based technology startup AppMachine, acquiring 40% of the company.[12][13]
In August 2015, EIG announced the acquisition of Site5 and Verio Web Hosting from NTT. It is estimated that EIG gained 86,000+ new subscribers through these acquisitions.[14][15]
In November 2015,[16] the company acquired Constant Contact, and days later laid off 15% of their workforce.[17]
Also in November 2015, EIG acquired the assets of Ecommerce, LLC for $28 million.[18] This acquisition included a total of 72,000 subscribers from three different hosting brands: IX Web Hosting, Cloud by IX, and Host Excellence.
Company structure[edit]
Although now one of the internet's largest web hosting providers, the company is structured differently than other large hosting companies such as Rackspace, GoDaddy, or 1&1 Internet. The company has grown its hosting and related business through numerous acquisitions.[10][19]
Subsidiary brands[edit]
The company owns and operates numerous hosting businesses, with shared support information and support agents. A partial list of these 83 EIG brands include:[20][21]

Endurance International Group (EIG), formerly BizLand, is a web hosting company. The company was founded in 1997, and is headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts.[1] It achieved its size by acquiring a large number of smaller companies, which it continues to operate under the original brand names.[2]
In 2011, Endurance was bought from Accel-KKR by Warburg Pincus and GS Capital Partners, for around $975 million.[3] In September 2013, the company announced plans to raise $400 million in an IPO.[4] The company announced it would list on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol EIGI.[5] It went public in October 2013 raising $252 million selling shares to the public at $12 each. This was below the company's target goal of $400  million.[6][7]
In a 2015 investor earnings conference call, the company reported having 4.2 million worldwide users.[8]
This path to increased size is similar to the path networking company Verio followed in the 1990s, using free cash flow and access to capital markets [9] in acquiring assets to add to their corporate portfolio.[10] The concept was to roll up small ISPs into one large national ISP and achieve economies of scale. Endurance is acquiring hosting companies domestically and internationally.[2]
Blake Cunneen, Endurance's senior vice president of corporate development has stated:

"Investing in mergers and acquisitions is a very accretive use of free cash flow and going forward we'll continue to do so. We don't have any deals we're announcing. But we told the Street to expect M&A growth to continue."[11]

The company made four buys in 2014. The biggest being a $109.8 million cash and stock deal for the web presence business of Directi from Indian-based Directi Web Technologies. Directi provides services in various countries, including India, the U.S., Turkey, China, Russia and Indonesia.[11]
In March 2015, the company announced an investment in Netherlands-based technology startup AppMachine, acquiring 40% of the company.[12][13]
In August 2015, EIG announced the acquisition of Site5 and Verio Web Hosting from NTT. It is estimated that EIG gained 86,000+ new subscribers through these acquisitions.[14][15]
In November 2015,[16] the company acquired Constant Contact, and days later laid off 15% of their workforce.[17]
Also in November 2015, EIG acquired the assets of Ecommerce, LLC for $28 million.[18] This acquisition included a total of 72,000 subscribers from three different hosting brands: IX Web Hosting, Cloud by IX, and Host Excellence.
Company structure[edit]
Although now one of the internet's largest web hosting providers, the company is structured differently than other large hosting companies such as Rackspace, GoDaddy, or 1&1 Internet. The company has grown its hosting and related business through numerous acquisitions.[10][19]
Subsidiary brands[edit]
The company owns and operates numerous hosting businesses, with shared support information and support agents. A partial list of these 83 EIG brands include:[20][21]
