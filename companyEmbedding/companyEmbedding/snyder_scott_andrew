The data is used to determine plurality of user segments. Each user of the plurality of users is classified into a one of the plurality of user segments. Then a plurality of behavioral models is determined, where each of the plurality of behavioral models comprises a statistical model of relations between behaviors of users within a corresponding one of the plurality of user segments. An intervention model is then determined for a user, where the intervention model is based on a behavior model of the user segment to which the user belongs. Interventions are then sent to a device of the user according to the intervention model.

Method and system for selecting optimal commodities based upon business profile and preferences



Patent number:  7707090
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method for assisting a customer in choosing a combination of commodities based on preferences of the customer. A combination is a set of related commodities, wherein bundling discounts may be applied to particular bundles of related commodities. Combination options are created by optimizing the categories within the combination in parallel, and then selecting the best value options from each category into a grouping. The effective cost of a grouping is calculated as a total of the effective costs of each option within the grouping. The effective costs consider weighted values of performance features in addition to the actual cost of a commodity. The groupings are ranked and presented to the user, so that the user may select a grouping as combination of commodities for purchase.

Job Details
               Arkitip no longer offers subscriptions because we are going to be switching to a new subscription reservation system. This system is still being developed but we hope to have it up and running by 1 March 2012. We have lost too much money on subscriptions due to the size and weight of each issue and we can no longer afford to do this. If you have a current subscription, we will fulfill it until it expires and when it is complete you will receive an offer to become a member of the subscription reservation system. This new system ensures that magazines ship on time and you never miss an issue.
