Frequently Asked Questions

 Am I legally required to have homeowners insurance, like states require car insurance?



Unlike auto insurance, you are not required by law to have a certain amount of coverage for your home. If you’re paying off a mortgage, however, the lender may require you to have homeowners insurance to protect the property from unexpected damage. 
Your home is a large investment and you don’t want to lose any of its value to an unforeseen disaster, so it’s a good idea to protect it with homeowners insurance.




 How much homeowners insurance coverage do I need?



The best way to find out how much coverage you may need is to conduct an appraisal. In addition to working with your Mercury agent, we recommend hiring an independent and licensed professional every several years to calculate the cost to rebuild your home with similar quality materials. Remember, this value may be different than the actual market value of your home. Once the appraisal is completed, you will have a better understanding of how much coverage is needed to protect your investment. You should also let your agent know if you plan to make any upgrades to ensure you have the proper amount of coverage in the event disaster strikes.




 How can I lower my homeowners insurance premium?



Several factors affect  how much you pay for your homeowners insurance, and these can include: 

Installing protective devices, such as smoke  alarms, fire extinguishers, burglar alarms, etc.;
Adjusting your protection options, like  raising your deductible, adding an auto policy, or changing coverage options;  and 
Using insurance-friendly construction materials,  such as concrete or tile roofs.   

A Mercury agent can help you discover exactly what  features in your home can decrease your premium, potentially saving you  hundreds of dollars a year. 




 Does homeowners insurance cover damage from earthquakes and floods?



Unfortunately, most  homeowners insurance policies don’t cover damage caused by an earthquake or a  flood. You have to buy earthquake insurance and flood insurance separately.  Just because these coverages aren’t included doesn’t mean they’re not  important. Earthquake and flood insurance cover the cost of repairing or  rebuilding your home if it’s damaged by these catastrophic events, potentially  saving you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Learn more about earthquake insurance. 











What our customers are saying 


I was very impressed with the staff at my Mercury office who called to see if I was in need of help during a local fire outbreak on a very windy day. They asked if I was in any danger of the fire path and let me know Mercury would relocate me if it was necessary to evacuate. At that moment I felt Mercury wasn't just a company I do business with. It was real people looking out for me.

Frequently Asked Questions

 How much car insurance coverage do I need?



There are a number of factors that help determine how much car insurance you may need, like how far you drive, the type of vehicle you own, where you live and your budget. Consider the following when thinking about what auto insurance coverage options are best for you:

If you’re making car payments, chances are the lender will require the vehicle to have comprehensive and collision coverage.
The deductible determines how much you pay out-of-pocket after a covered loss. So, if you’re looking to save money, consider increasing your deductible, which will lower your auto insurance rate. 
The age of your vehicle is another factor. If you have an older vehicle with a lower value, it might not make sense to pay for more expensive coverage like comprehensive and collision.
You should also consider how much liability coverage you need. Remember, if you only have $30,000 in liability coverage and you cause an accident that generates $100,000 in damages then you could be liable for the amount above your coverage limit. 

Taking these and other factors into consideration will put you on a path  to better understand how much car insurance you might need. Learn what each  coverage term means so you can craft the right coverage plan for your  needs, or speak with one  of our knowledgeable agents. They’ll help create a customized plan specifically  tailored to your needs. 




 By law, how much car insurance am I required to have?



Many states require drivers to have liability insurance in order to make  driving financially safe for all. If you don’t have the required amount of  insurance, you may be subject to fines and possible suspension or even loss of your  driver’s license. Find out how much insurance your state requires. You can also speak with one of our local agents, who can tell  you exactly how much insurance you need.




 How can I lower my auto insurance premium?



Everybody loves to save money, and auto insurance is no exception, so we’ve provided a few things you should consider when shopping for the best deal. 

Vehicle Make and Model: The type of vehicle you drive can have a big impact on your rate. For example, a BMW will typically cost more than a Ford. 
Anti-Theft Devices: You can generally get discounts for anti-theft features installed in your vehicle, because if your vehicle is harder to steal then the risk of loss is lower and that could save you money. 
Location, Location, Location: Where the vehicle is parked at night and how much you drive can have an impact on your rates, because if you drive 40 miles to work then there is a higher risk that you could get into a collision. 
Driving Record: The fewer accidents and tickets you have on your record, the lower your rate will be. 
Grades in school.
Bundle and Save: When you bundle auto and home coverage you could save on both your auto and home insurance.

A Mercury agent can help find discounts for which you may qualify, and offer other money-saving tips to help you save even more. 











What our customers are saying 


Mercury Insurance has always been extremely helpful with all of my needs over the years! I have been insured with this company for approximately four years and I have absolutely no complaints. My monthly rate is very cheap compared to any other company that has offered me car insurance. I have filed two claims through Mercury and both were handled quickly and efficiently with very little stress on my part.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

History[edit]
George Joseph founded Mercury Insurance in 1961 after working in the industry for a few years. Created to be a low cost alternative to larger insurance companies, Mercury Insurance found a profitable niche by offering private passenger automobile policies at a reduced premium for better than average risks. The key to this strategy was, and continues to be very tight underwriting and tight claims handling. The company operated solely in California until 1990, and since then has started expanding into a few other tough market states where nationwide carriers had ceased to operate.
On October 14, 2005, Fitch Ratings affirmed its 'A' long-term issuer rating on Mercury General Corporation and its 'A' rating on Mercury's senior unsecured notes due 2011.
Criticism[edit]
A March 2007 market conduct exam by the California Department of Insurance alleged that Mercury Insurance may have repeatedly engaged in practices that discriminated against active members of the U.S. military, the unemployed, those of certain occupations such as bartenders and painters, and unmarried adults living together. Additionally the company was alleged to have been inconsistent in its application of certain discounts, which resulted in some of its customers being overcharged.[4]
Representatives of Mercury Insurance were quick to argue that the leak of the conduct exam was a politically motivated move meant to benefit California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, a Republican candidate for California governor in the 2010 gubernatorial election.[5]
Subsidiary: Workmen's Auto Insurance Company[edit]
Workmen's Auto Insurance Company (Workmen's) is a nonstandard auto insurance company. For the first 65 years of business it was family owned and operated by the Shammas family. Today Workmen’s is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury General Corporation. The company is headquartered in downtown Los Angeles. Workmen’s sells personal lines automobile insurance mainly through independent agents. The Company is licensed in 22 states and actively doing business in seven states – California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, and Utah. Workmen’s works with small independent agents, often located in small towns and rural areas, this is a crucial part of its business model.
History[edit]
Workmen’s Auto Insurance Company was incorporated in 1949 in Los Angeles, California, by R. Leslie Kelley, the originator of Kelley Blue Book. In 1959, Mr. Kelley sold the Company to Mr. Nickolas N. Shammas,[6] a prominent businessman in downtown Los Angeles.
Mr. Shammas wanted to diversify his investments, believing that insurance nicely balanced his other core businesses, automobile dealerships and commercial real estate.[7] During the majority of the 45 years that Mr. Shammas owned Workmen’s it was a small California auto insurance company that wrote about $20 to $30 million in premiums each year. In 1987 with the passing of Prop 103, Workmen’s decided to expand beyond California at this point so as not to have all its eggs in the California insurance market basket.
Mr. Shammas died of lung cancer in the summer of 2003. At that time his eldest daughter, Carole Shammas, stepped in to take a more active role in the Company. For 14 years the Company was owned by 3 generations of the Shammas Family – matriarch, Jeanette H. Shammas (37.4%), daughters, Carole Shammas and Diane Shammas (60.4%) and granddaughter, Julia Holter (2.2%).[8]
At its height from 2002 to 2005 Workmen’s conducted business in 16 states and wrote as much as $130 million in premiums.[8] Thereafter, cyclical trends in insurance and then the Great Recession of 2008 led the Company to downsize.
In December 2009, the company's 60th anniversary, the brand was refreshed with a new logo, website and image.
Effective January 2, 2015 Workmen’s became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury General Corporation.
Current products[edit]

Auto insurance: Workmen’s offers one main type of policy for vehicle insurance in the United States. They sell non-standard car insurance to individuals that are unable to secure coverage through standard insurance companies. This can be due to a driving record with accidents and/or tickets, prior DUI, the driver's age, vehicle type, or others.

Competition and memberships[edit]
Workmen’s competitors vary depending on the state but in general its major competitors include Infinity Property & Casualty Corporation, Dairyland also known as Sentry Insurance, Access, Alliance United and Foremost acquired by Farmers Insurance Group. Workmen’s is a member of PCI,[9] Property Casualty Insurers Association of America and very active in its local affiliate ACIC.[10] As a small company, it is not rated by A.M. Best.
Legal[edit]
Workmen's in order to be compliant with the law, each year has to file an annual statement with the California Department of Insurance.[11][12] The company is also required to have a National Association of Insurance Commissioners number (NAIC#13250). This number is required to be used at all times as it allows NAIC to regulate all insurance companies conduct in the respective state or territory they have business in order to protect the interests of insurance consumers.[13][14]

History[edit]
George Joseph founded Mercury Insurance in 1961 after working in the industry for a few years. Created to be a low cost alternative to larger insurance companies, Mercury Insurance found a profitable niche by offering private passenger automobile policies at a reduced premium for better than average risks. The key to this strategy was, and continues to be very tight underwriting and tight claims handling. The company operated solely in California until 1990, and since then has started expanding into a few other tough market states where nationwide carriers had ceased to operate.
On October 14, 2005, Fitch Ratings affirmed its 'A' long-term issuer rating on Mercury General Corporation and its 'A' rating on Mercury's senior unsecured notes due 2011.
Criticism[edit]
A March 2007 market conduct exam by the California Department of Insurance alleged that Mercury Insurance may have repeatedly engaged in practices that discriminated against active members of the U.S. military, the unemployed, those of certain occupations such as bartenders and painters, and unmarried adults living together. Additionally the company was alleged to have been inconsistent in its application of certain discounts, which resulted in some of its customers being overcharged.[4]
Representatives of Mercury Insurance were quick to argue that the leak of the conduct exam was a politically motivated move meant to benefit California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, a Republican candidate for California governor in the 2010 gubernatorial election.[5]
Subsidiary: Workmen's Auto Insurance Company[edit]
Workmen's Auto Insurance Company (Workmen's) is a nonstandard auto insurance company. For the first 65 years of business it was family owned and operated by the Shammas family. Today Workmen’s is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury General Corporation. The company is headquartered in downtown Los Angeles. Workmen’s sells personal lines automobile insurance mainly through independent agents. The Company is licensed in 22 states and actively doing business in seven states – California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, and Utah. Workmen’s works with small independent agents, often located in small towns and rural areas, this is a crucial part of its business model.
History[edit]
Workmen’s Auto Insurance Company was incorporated in 1949 in Los Angeles, California, by R. Leslie Kelley, the originator of Kelley Blue Book. In 1959, Mr. Kelley sold the Company to Mr. Nickolas N. Shammas,[6] a prominent businessman in downtown Los Angeles.
Mr. Shammas wanted to diversify his investments, believing that insurance nicely balanced his other core businesses, automobile dealerships and commercial real estate.[7] During the majority of the 45 years that Mr. Shammas owned Workmen’s it was a small California auto insurance company that wrote about $20 to $30 million in premiums each year. In 1987 with the passing of Prop 103, Workmen’s decided to expand beyond California at this point so as not to have all its eggs in the California insurance market basket.
Mr. Shammas died of lung cancer in the summer of 2003. At that time his eldest daughter, Carole Shammas, stepped in to take a more active role in the Company. For 14 years the Company was owned by 3 generations of the Shammas Family – matriarch, Jeanette H. Shammas (37.4%), daughters, Carole Shammas and Diane Shammas (60.4%) and granddaughter, Julia Holter (2.2%).[8]
At its height from 2002 to 2005 Workmen’s conducted business in 16 states and wrote as much as $130 million in premiums.[8] Thereafter, cyclical trends in insurance and then the Great Recession of 2008 led the Company to downsize.
In December 2009, the company's 60th anniversary, the brand was refreshed with a new logo, website and image.
Effective January 2, 2015 Workmen’s became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercury General Corporation.
Current products[edit]

Auto insurance: Workmen’s offers one main type of policy for vehicle insurance in the United States. They sell non-standard car insurance to individuals that are unable to secure coverage through standard insurance companies. This can be due to a driving record with accidents and/or tickets, prior DUI, the driver's age, vehicle type, or others.

Competition and memberships[edit]
Workmen’s competitors vary depending on the state but in general its major competitors include Infinity Property & Casualty Corporation, Dairyland also known as Sentry Insurance, Access, Alliance United and Foremost acquired by Farmers Insurance Group. Workmen’s is a member of PCI,[9] Property Casualty Insurers Association of America and very active in its local affiliate ACIC.[10] As a small company, it is not rated by A.M. Best.
Legal[edit]
Workmen's in order to be compliant with the law, each year has to file an annual statement with the California Department of Insurance.[11][12] The company is also required to have a National Association of Insurance Commissioners number (NAIC#13250). This number is required to be used at all times as it allows NAIC to regulate all insurance companies conduct in the respective state or territory they have business in order to protect the interests of insurance consumers.[13][14]

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition.
