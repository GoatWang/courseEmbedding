About Us
Our Mission Statement
Cloud Peak Energy aims to be a leading energy producer operating in a safe, responsible and caring manner.

We will operate in accordance with our values.
We will not lose sight of our goal of maximizing the long-term financial return to our shareholders.
We believe that by ensuring the safety and long-term health of our employees are not compromised and that by being a good neighbor in the communities in which we live and work, value will be maximized.
We will run the business in a sustainable way to ensure we maintain our “license to operate” (i.e. support of employees, communities, regulators, elected officials, customers, suppliers).

Our current strategy is to build on our strong US domestic position to develop our export sales and explore international production opportunities.



Our Values
Cloud Peak Energy’s values are the underlying principles that guide the way we do business. We will hold each other accountable to not deviate from these values in all our business dealings.
Safety – The safety of everyone involved in our business will never be compromised.
Caring – We care about the impact of our actions on people and the environment both inside and outside the company.
Honesty – We are honest and transparent in all interactions with each other and those outside the company.
Courage – We will be courageous in all our dealings and will hold ourselves accountable for our actions and not avoid difficult issues.
Respect – We will show respect to all those involved in every interaction and work to engage all our employees in the business.

        Net income (loss) of $(20.1) million, Adjusted EBITDA of $20.4 
        million, and an average cost of $9.78 per ton, were all improved 
        results as compared to the first quarter of 2016.
      

        Exported 0.5 million tons during the first quarter and have contracted 
        3.3 million total tons of Asian export sales to be delivered in 2017.
      

        The Company received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and 
        commissions, of $64.7 million on the issuance of 13.5 million shares 
        of common stock. Equity issuance proceeds funded the full $64.5 
        million redemption of the outstanding 2019 Senior Notes. These 
        transactions resulted in a reduction in outstanding long-term debt and 
        no debt maturities until 2021.
      

        Ended the quarter with total available liquidity of $455 million.
      


      Colin Marshall, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our 
      lower operating costs reflect the many cost control and efficiency 
      initiatives we put in place during 2016 to adapt to lower shipments. We 
      delivered a solid operational and financial performance in the first 
      quarter as the industry environment continued to improve. During the 
      quarter, we continued to increase our export shipments, although the 
      volume ramp-up was challenged by severe weather in the Pacific Northwest 
      that negatively impacted rail performance. We currently have contracted 
      3.3 million tons to be exported during 2017, with additional sales 
      anticipated as the year progresses.”
    

Health, Safety, and Environment


      During the first quarter of 2017, of the Company’s approximately 1,150 
      full-time mine site employees, there was one reportable injury resulting 
      in a Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) All Injury Frequency 
      Rate (“AIFR”) of 0.34. During the 36 MSHA inspector days at the mine 
      sites during the quarter, the Company received one significant and 
      substantial citation with an assessment totaling $934.
    

      There were no reportable environmental incidents during the quarter.

      Shipments during the first quarter of 2017 were stronger than the first 
      quarter of 2016, supported by higher natural gas prices of around $3.00 
      per MMBtu. Utility coal-fired power plants continued to run during the 
      quarter and drew down coal inventories, although not as much as 
      anticipated due to the very mild winter.
    

      Revenue from the Owned and Operated Mines segment increased four percent 
      in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due 
      to higher shipments, partially offset by lower average realized prices 
      per ton. Cost per ton improved to $9.78 for the first quarter of 2017 
      compared with $11.15 for the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year 
      improvement was driven by increased shipments and the cost reduction and 
      efficiency measures taken during 2016.
    


Logistics and Related Activities



      The Logistics and Related Activities segment comprises the results of 
      the Company’s logistics and transportation services to its domestic and 
      international customers.

      The Company exported 0.5 million tons to Asian customers during the 
      first quarter of 2017. This reflected the continued start-up of export 
      shipments announced in the third quarter of 2016, driven by increased 
      international thermal coal demand and pricing. Adjusted EBITDA includes 
      certain minimum payments pursuant to the Company’s new rail and port 
      agreements and unexpectedly high demurrage charges caused by rail delays 
      moving the coal to the terminal. The Company has currently contracted 
      3.3 million tons to export during 2017 and is planning to export 
      approximately 5 million tons during the full year, which will largely be 
      dependent on rail and port performance and prevailing prices.
    

Cash, Liquidity, and Financial Position


      Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 were $100.5 million. 
      During the first quarter, the cash inflow from operations totaled $19.7 
      million, while capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest) 
      used $4.1 million.
    

      At March 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the A/R 
      Securitization Program, which had an available borrowing capacity of 
      approximately $22 million. On January 31, 2017, the A/R Securitization 
      Program was amended to extend the term to January 23, 2020 to allow for 
      the ability to issue letters of credit and to reduce the combined 
      maximum borrowing capacity, subject to terms and conditions, for both 
      cash and letters of credit to $70 million.
    

      At March 31, 2017, the available borrowing capacity under the $400 
      million Credit Agreement was approximately $332 million, which reflects 
      approximately $68 million of outstanding, undrawn letters of credit used 
      as collateral for its reclamation bonds. The Company ended the quarter 
      with total available liquidity of $455 million.
    

      Throughout 2016 and early 2017, the Company made considerable progress 
      improving its financial position, as it exited reclamation self-bonding, 
      completed Exchange Offers on its senior notes, and renegotiated the 
      throughput contracts with Westshore and BNSF. During the quarter, the 
      Company issued 13.5 million shares of common stock for proceeds, net of 
      underwriting discounts and commissions, of $64.7 million. These proceeds 
      were used to retire the remaining 2019 Senior Notes, which were 
      redeemed, including a premium of 101.417 and accrued and unpaid 
      interest, for a total payment of $64.5 million. The Company now has no 
      debt maturities until 2021.
    

Government Affairs


      The early actions of the Trump administration and Congress have brought 
      some welcome regulatory relief for the industry. The overturning of the 
      Stream Protection Rule using the Congressional Review Act and the recent 
      Executive Orders that directed a review of the Waters of the U.S. rule 
      and the Clean Power Plan, the lifting of the federal coal-leasing 
      moratorium and halting of the associated Programmatic Environmental 
      Impact Statement will help U.S. coal producers. The suspension and 
      re-evaluation of the 2017 federal coal valuation rule is also a positive 
      change for the Company’s export logistics business as the Department of 
      the Interior reverts to the previous long-standing methodology during 
      this re-evaluation and removes the complexity and uncertainty that the 
      new rule would have introduced. These actions are important and welcome, 
      serving to add predictability and eliminate new and unnecessary costs 
      for mining operations. Looking forward, the Company is optimistic that 
      Congress and the current administration will support the development and 
      commercialization of advanced coal technology, as well as establish a 
      regulatory framework that gives utilities the confidence to invest in 
      the nation’s critical coal power plant fleet, which provides safe, 
      reliable and affordable electricity across the U.S.
    

Domestic Outlook


      Mine shipments to domestic customers for the first quarter were 13.5 
      million tons, in line with customer schedules and reflecting the usual 
      seasonal suspension of shipments on the Great Lakes. With natural gas 
      prices around $3.00 per MMBtu, utilities have maintained their 
      consumption levels of PRB coal and are taking their contracted coal. The 
      latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) 
      shows that natural gas inventories have declined by 368 BCF, or 14.8 
      percent, due to winter heating demand and reduced production, compared 
      to 2016 levels. Energy Ventures Analysis (“EVA”) estimates that PRB coal 
      inventories at utilities were 82 million tons as of the end of the first 
      quarter of 2017, a decline of 15 million tons from first quarter 2016 
      levels. Unfortunately, the very mild winter prevented PRB stockpiles 
      from declining further, resulting in continued elevated levels. Full 
      year shipments will largely depend on the level of summer cooling 
      demand, natural gas prices and associated coal burn. These factors will 
      dictate the level of third quarter coal buying and shipments utilities 
      require in preparation for winter.
    

      For 2017, the Company is currently planning to ship between 55 and 60 
      million tons, with current commitments to sell 56 million tons, which 
      includes 3.3 million tons with export customers. Of this committed 
      production, 55 million tons are under fixed-price contracts with a 
      weighted-average price of $12.19 per ton. The approximately 2 million 
      committed tons for 2017 that the Company priced during the first quarter 
      of 2017 were at an average price of $11.39 per ton, in line with the 
      prevailing prices at that time.
    

      The Company is currently contracted to sell 29 million tons in 2018, all 
      to domestic customers. Of this committed production, 27 million tons are 
      under fixed-price contracts with a weighted-average price of $12.51 per 
      ton. Utilities continue to delay new coal purchases due to their 
      elevated stockpiles after the very mild winter. While this maximizes 
      their flexibility, it could lead to some price support for coal during 
      periods of increased natural gas prices and electricity demand.
    

      “The current outlook for U.S. thermal coal producers is a lot brighter 
      than it was at this time last year. After good first quarter shipments, 
      many of our customers are indicating that they will continue to take 
      their contracted tons and will buy more coal for in-year delivery, if 
      summer demand is elevated. We remain optimistic that the PRB could see 
      year-over-year demand grow by approximately 10 million tons or more if 
      natural gas prices remain above $3.00 per MMBtu, and we have a normal 
      summer,” said Marshall.
    

International Outlook


      International thermal coal prices remained solid during the first 
      quarter of 2017 as China continued to manage its domestic production 
      levels and increase imports. This left international coal supplies 
      better matched to demand. Disruptions to Australian coal producers 
      caused by Cyclone Debbie in late March are forecast to impact the rail 
      system until early May. While metallurgical coal prices have risen 
      rapidly, Newcastle thermal coal prices have stabilized above $80 per 
      tonne. It will take some time for the full impacts of the disruption 
      from Cyclone Debbie to work their way through the system as buyers wait 
      for supply to resume or find alternative coal sources.
    

      Sustained international prices have allowed the Company to book export 
      sales of 3.3 million tons for delivery throughout 2017. Strong demand 
      should allow total 2017 export sales volumes of approximately 5 million 
      tons dependent on the capacity of the rail and port system to increase 
      shipment rates. The Company continues to receive strong interest from 
      Asian customers for its Spring Creek coal and will seek to layer in 
      sales for the remainder of 2017 as opportunities arise.
    

2017 Guidance – Financial and Operational Estimates


      “First quarter shipments showed a marked improvement over the first 
      quarter of 2016, with solid demand from both domestic and international 
      customers. Although the early end to winter and export rail challenges 
      negatively impacted our performance, we are now looking ahead to steady 
      summer demand and normalized export rail performance. While 2017 will 
      hold plenty of challenges, including a traditionally soft second 
      quarter, the actions we took in 2016 to control our costs and improve 
      our financial position mean we are well placed to successfully manage 
      through the current environment and prosper as it improves,” commented 
      Marshall.
    

      As explained in the February 2017 earnings call, reaching the top of the 
      Adjusted EBITDA range would have required an increase in the price of 
      export sales from then prevailing levels. To reflect year-to-date sales 
      made since then, the Company is lowering the top end of its Adjusted 
      EBITDA guidance range by $10 million to $110 million. The following 
      table provides the current outlook and assumptions for selected 2017 
      consolidated financial and operational metrics:

      facts.
    

      These statements are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and 
      assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results 
      to differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in 
      the forward-looking statements. The following factors are among those 
      that may cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from 
      our forward-looking statements: (1) the timing and extent of any 
      sustained recovery in the coal industry, domestically and 
      internationally, and the impact of ongoing or further depressed industry 
      conditions on our financial performance, liquidity and financial 
      covenant compliance; (2) the prices we receive for our coal and 
      logistics services, our ability to effectively execute our forward sales 
      strategy, and changes in utility purchasing patterns resulting in 
      decreased long term purchases of coal; (3) the timing of reductions or 
      increases in customer coal inventories; (4) our ability to obtain new 
      coal sales agreements on favorable terms, to resolve customer requests 
      for reductions or deferrals, and to respond to any cancellations of 
      their committed volumes on terms that preserve the amount and timing of 
      our forecasted economic value; (5) the impact of increasingly variable 
      and less predictable demand for thermal coal based on natural gas 
      prices, summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth 
      rates and other factors that impact overall demand for electricity; (6) 
      our ability to efficiently and safely conduct our mining operations and 
      to adjust our planned production levels to respond to market conditions 
      and effectively manage the costs of our operations; (7) competition with 
      other producers of coal and with traders and re-sellers of coal, 
      including the current oversupply of thermal coal, the impacts of 
      currency exchange rate fluctuations and the strong U.S. dollar, and 
      government environmental, energy and tax policies and regulations that 
      make foreign coal producers more competitive for international 
      transactions; (8) the impact of coal industry bankruptcies on our 
      competitive position relative to other companies who have recently 
      emerged from bankruptcy with reduced leverage and potentially reduced 
      operating costs; (9) competition with natural gas, wind, solar and other 
      non-coal energy resources, which may continue to increase as a result of 
      low domestic natural gas prices, the declining cost of renewables, and 
      due to environmental, energy and tax policies, regulations, subsidies 
      and other government actions that encourage or mandate use of 
      alternative energy sources; (10) coal-fired power plant capacity and 
      utilization, including the impact of climate change and other 
      environmental regulations and initiatives, energy policies, political 
      pressures, NGO activities, international treaties or agreements and 
      other factors that may cause domestic and international electric 
      utilities to continue to phase out or close existing coal-fired power 
      plants, reduce or eliminate construction of any new coal-fired power 
      plants, or reduce consumption of coal from the PRB; (11) the failure of 
      economic, commercially available carbon capture technology to be 
      developed and adopted by utilities in a timely manner; (12) the impact 
      of “keep coal in the ground” campaigns and other well-funded, anti-coal 
      initiatives by environmental activist groups and others targeting 
      substantially all aspects of our industry; (13) our ability to offset 
      declining U.S. demand for coal and achieve longer term growth in our 
      business through our logistics revenue and export sales, including the 
      significant impact of Chinese and Indian thermal coal import demand and 
      production levels from other basins on overall seaborne coal prices; 
      (14) railroad, export terminal and other transportation performance, 
      costs and availability, including the availability of sufficient and 
      reliable rail capacity to transport PRB coal, the development of future 
      export terminal capacity and our ability to access capacity on 
      commercially reasonable terms; (15) the impact of our rail and terminal 
      take-or-pay commitments if we do not meet our required export shipment 
      obligations; (16) weather conditions and weather-related damage that 
      impact our mining operations, our customers, or transportation 
      infrastructure; (17) operational, geological, equipment, permit, labor, 
      and other risks inherent in surface coal mining; (18) future development 
      or operating costs for our development projects exceeding our 
      expectations; (19) our ability to successfully acquire coal and 
      appropriate land access rights at economic prices and in a timely manner 
      and our ability to effectively resolve issues with conflicting mineral 
      development that may impact our mine plans; (20) the impact of asset 
      impairment charges if required as a result of challenging industry 
      conditions or other factors; (21) our plans and objectives for future

      regulatory challenges, including additional requirements, uncertainties, 
      costs, liabilities or restrictions adversely affecting the use, demand 
      or price for coal, our mining operations or the logistics, 
      transportation, or terminal industries; (23) the impact of required 
      regulatory processes and approvals to lease coal and obtain permits for 
      coal mining operations or to transport coal to domestic and foreign 
      customers, including third-party legal challenges to regulatory 
      approvals that are required for some or all of our current or planned 
      mining activities; (24) any increases in rates or changes in regulatory 
      interpretations or assessment methodologies with respect to royalties or 
      severance and production taxes and the potential impact of associated

      terms and restrictions of our indebtedness; (32) liquidity constraints, 
      access to capital and credit markets and availability and costs of 
      credit, surety bonds, letters of credit, and insurance, including risks 
      resulting from the cost or unavailability of financing due to debt and 
      equity capital and credit market conditions for the coal sector or in 
      general, changes in our credit rating, our compliance with the covenants

      described from time to time in the reports and registration statements 
      we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those in 
      Item 1A - Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and any updates 
      thereto in our Forms 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
    

      Additional factors, events or uncertainties that may emerge from time to 
      time, or those that we currently deem to be immaterial, could cause our 
      actual results to differ, and it is not possible for us to predict all 
      of them. We make forward-looking statements based on currently available 
      information, and we assume no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any 
      obligation to, update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements 
      made in this release or our related quarterly investor presentation, 
      whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, 
      except as required by law.
    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      This release and our related presentation include the non-GAAP financial 
      measure of Adjusted EBITDA (on a consolidated basis and for our 
      reporting segments). Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide additional 
      information only and does not have any standard meaning prescribed by 
      generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of 
      America. (“U.S. GAAP”). A quantitative reconciliation of historical net 
      income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is found in the tables accompanying 
      this release. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before: (1) interest 
      income (expense), net, (2) income tax provision, (3) depreciation and 
      depletion, and (4) amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as 
      further adjusted for accretion, which represents non-cash increases in 
      asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of 
      time, and specifically identified items that management believes do not 
      directly reflect our core operations. For the periods presented herein, 
      the specifically identified items are: (1) adjustments to exclude 
      non-cash impairment charges, (2) adjustments for derivative financial 
      instruments, excluding fair value mark-to-market gains or losses and 
      including cash amounts received or paid, (3) adjustments to exclude debt 
      restructuring costs, and (4) non-cash throughput amortization expense 
      related to payments made to amend the BNSF and Westshore agreements. We 
      enter into certain derivative financial instruments such as put options 
      that require the payment of premiums at contract inception. The 
      reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the 
      mark-to-market gains or losses. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA does 
      not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments; either 
      at contract inception, as these payments pertain to future settlement 
      periods, or in the period of contract settlement, as the payment 
      occurred in a preceding period. In prior years the amortization of port 
      and rail contract termination payments were included as part of EBITDA 
      and Adjusted EBITDA because the cash payments approximated the amount of 
      amortization being taken during the year. During 2017, management 
      determined that the non-cash portion of amortization arising from 
      payments made in prior years as well as the amortization of contract 
      termination payments should be adjusted out of EBITDA because the 
      ongoing cash payments are now significantly smaller than the overall 
      amortization of these payments and no longer reflect the transactional 
      results. Because of the inherent uncertainty related to the items 
      identified above, management does not believe it is able to provide a 
      meaningful forecast of the comparable GAAP measures or reconciliation to 
      any forecasted GAAP measure.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is an additional tool intended to assist our management 
      in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of 
      business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that 
      management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating 
      operating performance, comparing performance across periods, planning 
      and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels 
      of operating and capital investments. Period-to-period comparisons of 
      Adjusted EBITDA are intended to help our management identify and assess 
      additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be 
      shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss). 
      Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also used as part of our incentive 
      compensation program for our executive officers and others.
    

      We believe Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors, analysts and 
      other external users of our consolidated financial statements in 
      evaluating our operating performance from period to period and comparing 
      our performance to similar operating results of other relevant 
      companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure a company’s 
      operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, 
      taxes, depreciation and depletion, amortization and accretion and other 
      specifically identified items that are not considered to directly 
      reflect our core operations.
    

      Our management recognizes that using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance 
      measure has inherent limitations as compared to net income (loss) or 
      other GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain 
      items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be 
      meaningful to investors. As a result of these exclusions, Adjusted 
      EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be 
      an alternative to net income (loss) or other GAAP financial measures as 
      a measure of our operating performance. Because not all companies use 
      identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
