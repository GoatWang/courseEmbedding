Everett Spinco / CSC Merger Tax Documentation

U.S. Federal Income Tax Information Relating to Computer Sciences Corporation’s Merger with New Everett Merger Sub, Inc.
Effective April 1, 2017 (the “Effective Time”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 24, 2016, among Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Houston”), Everett SpinCo, Inc. (“Everett”), Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC: or “Chicago”), Everett Merger Sub Inc. and New Everett Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), as amended as of November 2, 2016, as further amended as of December 6, 2016, and as may be further amended from time to time, Merger Sub merged with and into Chicago (the “Merger”), with Chicago surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Everett.
Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding common share of Chicago was exchanged for one (1) common share of Everett stock.  No cash or other consideration was received in exchange for Chicago common stock. 
The documentation provided below summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, as well as provides additional information.
The information contained herein does not apply to you if you sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of CSC common stock prior to the Effective Time.
The information contained herein has been prepared by CSC for general information purposes only and does not represent an opinion of counsel or otherwise constitute tax advice. It does not purport to be complete or to describe the consequences that may apply to particular categories of shareholders. The information contained herein also assumes that you are a U.S. taxpayer that holds your CSC common stock as a capital asset (generally, property held for investment). The tax rules are very complex, and you are urged to consult your own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distribution, as well as any other U.S. federal, state, local or foreign tax laws. We also urge you to read the information statement for the definitive Proxy Statement for the Merger, noting especially the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution and Merger” for more information regarding the potential tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Form 8937 Final

Everett SpinCo, Inc. Enters into an Indenture with U.S. Bank National Association and Closes Previously Announced Offering of the Notes
Mar 27 17
On March 27, 2017, Everett SpinCo, Inc. entered into an indenture between the company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee), and a First Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee (the First Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture) pursuant to which the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes), $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes and, together with the 2020 Notes and the 2024 Notes, the Notes). The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or under any state securities laws and were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2020 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 2.875% per annum, which is payable in cash on a semi-annual basis on March 27 and September 27 of each year, commencing on September 27, 2017. The 2024 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.250% per annum, which is payable in cash on a semi-annual basis on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2017. The 2027 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.750% per annum, which is payable in cash on a semi-annual basis on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2017.

On March 27, 2017, the company announced the closing of its previously announced offering of the Notes.

Everett Spinco, Inc. Provides Earnings Guidance for the First Quarter Ended January 31, 2017
Mar 8 17
Everett Spinco, Inc. provided earnings guidance for the first quarter ended January 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company estimates that net revenue will be approximately $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion, a decrease of 4% to 11% from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. This estimated decrease is due to weak demand in the EMEA region, particularly the U.K. public sector market, the run off of several large contracts and unfavorable currency fluctuations.

Second quarter net revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 13% from the prior-year period and down 5% when adjusted for divestitures and currency. Second quarter GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations was ($0.29), down from a GAAP  diluted net  earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $0.18 in the prior-year period. Second quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS from continuing operations was $0.25, down from $0.33 in the prior-year period.  Second quarter non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net EPS from continuing operations exclude after-tax costs of $903 million and $0.54 per diluted share, respectively, related to valuation allowances and divestiture taxes, separation costs, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and other related charges, tax indemnification adjustments, defined benefit plan settlement charges and remeasurement benefit, and an adjustment to earnings from equity interests. “Despite some current headwinds, we delivered Q2 non-GAAP EPS in line with our outlook,” said Meg Whitman, President and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  “We saw strength in major components of our growth strategy, including high-performance compute, Aruba, all-flash storage and Technology Services.  While we still have much more work to do, HPE’s Q2 results give me confidence that our efforts are delivering for customers and partners.” HPE fiscal 2017 second quarter continuing operations financial performance  Q2 FY17 Q2 FY16 Y/YGAAP net revenue ($B)$7.4 $8.5  (13%)GAAP operating margin 2.4% 5.3%(2.9 pts.)GAAP net (loss) earnings ($B)($0.5)$0.3  (251%)GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share($0.29)$0.18  (261%)Non-GAAP operating margin 7.8% 9.1%(1.3 pts.)Non-GAAP net earnings ($B)$0.4 $0.6  (29%)Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share$0.25 $0.33  (24%)Cash flow from operations ($B)$0.6 $1.1 ($0.5) Information about HPE’s use of non-GAAP financial information is provided under “Use of non-GAAP financial information” below.  OutlookFor the fiscal 2017 third quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of ($0.02) to $0.02 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.28.

These organizational changes resulted in: (i) within the Enterprise Group segment, primarily, the transfer of the big data storage product group previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Storage business unit; the transfer of the Aruba services capabilities previously reported within the Networking business unit to the Technology Services business unit; and (ii) the transfer of the CMS product group previously reported within the former ES segment to the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment. The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which resulted in: (i) within the Enterprise Group segment, primarily, the transfer of net revenue from the big data storage product group previously reported within the Servers business unit to the Storage business unit; the transfer of net revenue from the Aruba services capabilities previously reported within the Networking business unit to the Technology Services business unit; and (ii) the transfer of net revenue, related eliminations of intersegment revenues and operating profit from the CMS product group previously reported within the former ES segment to the Technology Services business unit within the Enterprise Group segment. Effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and prior to the completion of the spinoff of the enterprise services business, Everett SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Everett SpinCo, Inc. with Computer Sciences Corporation, the Company transferred historical net revenue and operating profit from the previously divested MphasiS product group which was reported within the former ES segment to the Corporate Investments segment. The changes within the Enterprise Group segment had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s previously reported Enterprise Group segment net revenue and earnings from operations. The change between former ES segment and the Enterprise Group segment had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from continuing operations, net earnings from continuing operations or net earnings per share from continuing operations.  HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIESSEGMENT/BUSINESS UNIT INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In millions, except percentages)       Six Months Ended April 30, Change (%)  2017 2016 Y/YNet revenue:(a)      Enterprise Group      Servers $6,094  $7,034  (13%)Technology Services 3,914  4,004  (2%)Storage 1,429  1,645  (13%)Networking 1,131  1,658  (32%)Total Enterprise Group 12,568  14,341  (12%)       Software 1,406  1,554  (10%)Financial Services 1,695  1,564  8%Corporate Investments —  348  (100%)Total segment net revenue 15,669  17,807  (12%)       Elimination of intersegment net revenue and other (668) (766) (13%)Total Hewlett Packard Enterprise consolidated net revenue $15,001  $17,041  (12%)  (a) As of April 1, 2017, with the spinoff of the enterprise services business, Everett SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Everett SpinCo, Inc. with Computer Sciences Corporation, the Company reclassified the historical net (loss) earnings from the former enterprise services segment ("former ES segment"), to Net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Use of non-GAAP financial measuresTo supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed and consolidated financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides revenue on a constant currency basis, revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, non-GAAP diluted net  earnings per share from continuing operations, non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations, gross cash, free cash flow, normalized free cash flow, net capital expenditures, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency is revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating expense is total costs and expenses. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating margin is operating margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations is net (loss) earnings from continuing operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations is net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net   earnings per share from continuing operations is diluted net (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations is diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to normalized free cash flow is cash flow from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net capital expenditures is investment in property, plant and equipment. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net debt and operating company net debt is total company debt. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to each of net cash and operating company net cash is cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett Packard EnterpriseRevenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Revenue from continuing operations adjusted for divestitures and currency excludes revenue resulting from businesses divestitures in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 and also assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit, and non-GAAP operating margin are defined to exclude the effects of a gain on the MphasiS and H3C divestitures and any charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, charges relating to the separation and divestiture  transactions, acquisition and other related charges and defined benefit plan settlement and remeasurement charges. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations consist of net (loss) earnings or diluted net (loss) earnings per share excluding those same charges and tax valuation allowances and divestiture taxes, adjustments to loss from equity interest, tax indemnification adjustments and tax settlements. Non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations and non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations consist of net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations or diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations excluding those same charges, as applicable to discontinued operations. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance relative to its competitors. Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segment operating performance. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to better understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s segments, as Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons: Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded a gain on the sale of its assets and liabilities identified as part of the H3C and MphasiS transactions during fiscal 2016. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these gains for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures because it believes that these one-time gains do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operational performance, thereby facilitating a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets. Those charges are included in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s GAAP earnings from operations, operating margin, net (loss) earnings and diluted net (loss) earnings per share. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to (i) employee termination costs and benefits (ii) costs to vacate duplicative facilities and (iii) an accelerated employee stock compensation program. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these restructuring costs (and any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods) for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures because it believes that these historical costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance or comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Separation costs are expenses associated with HPI’s (formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard Company” or “HP Co.”) separation into two independent publicly-traded companies and the spin-off and merger transactions of the Enterprise Services business with CSC ("Everett Transaction") and the Software business with Micro Focus. The charges are primarily related to third-party consulting, contractor fees, early debt settlement costs, marketing and branding related expenses, and other incremental costs incurred to complete the transactions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these separation costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs cost related to its acquisitions and divestitures, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. The charges are direct expenses such as professional fees and retention costs, as well as non-cash adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as inventory. Because non-cash or non-capitalized acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisitions and divestitures, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s past operating performance.Adjustments to loss from equity interests includes purchase accounting adjustments and the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating profit facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs defined benefit plan settlement and remeasurement charges relating to its defined pension plans. The charges are associated with the net settlement resulting from voluntary lump sum payments offered to certain terminated vested participants and remeasurement of plan assets in connection with the Everett Transaction, resulting in a decrease to the net periodic pension expense. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Tax indemnification adjustments are related to changes in the indemnification positions between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HPI that are recorded by the Company as pre-tax income or expense and not considered tax expense. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.Tax settlements represent settlements of certain pre-separation Hewlett-Packard Company income tax liabilities shared with HP Inc. through the Tax Matters Agreement. The Company excluded this charge for the purpose of calculation non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods.As a result of the Everett Transaction, a full valuation allowance was recorded on U.S. state deferred tax assets, which resulted from the removal of Everett entities. As a result, the Company has a 3 year cumulative loss position and insufficient future earnings to be able to realize these deferred tax assets. There are additional taxes related to the Everett Transaction that was recorded upon the spinoff. Since these charges do not represent ongoing expenses, Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s current operating performance and comparisons to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance in other periods. Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measuresThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are: Items such as amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations, and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets.Items such as restructuring charges and separation costs that are excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and cash flows.Hewlett Packard Enterprise may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure.Other companies may calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations differently than Hewlett Packard Enterprise does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measuresHewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review carefully those reconciliations. Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investorsHewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing revenue on a constant currency basis, revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP net (loss) earnings from discontinued operations, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations, gross cash, free cash flow, normalized free cash flow, net capital expenditures, net debt, net cash, operating company net debt and operating company net cash financial measures to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s results “through the eyes” of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further believes that providing this information better enables Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s investors to understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.  Editorial contact
