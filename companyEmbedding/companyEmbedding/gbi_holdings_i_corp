About Us




Company Profile
The origins of the company commenced in 1959 with two of the originating directors, Ross Gibson and Jim Benness, forming the company Gibson Benness Industries Pty Ltd in 1969, servicing the building sector. This then led to a period of strong growth with many new ventures happening and exciting products released. With this diversification came the decision to form GBI Sales Pty Ltd. The group then clearly had a building division and a supplier to retail. In 2008, GBI Sales formed a camping & hardware division servicing the Homewares, Hardware and Camping Retail Sectors. 

            In 2009 GBI celebrated 50 years of successful service to Industry. The Distribution Company that was originally started by Ross Gibson and Jim Benness has continued the strong philosophy of only representing the best brands. From those first days when the company employed 8 people it has continued to service kitchen manufacturers and today employs over 70 people to cover the diverse range of products now sold. We are very proud of the strong, long standing relationship we share with partners such as: The Laminex Group, Miele, Quantum Quartz and Laminam. The search is always on-going for new and innovative products. 

            Success has been maintained by living out our theme:

Our Motto

"Making the Best Better"  through our staff providing service with personality.
