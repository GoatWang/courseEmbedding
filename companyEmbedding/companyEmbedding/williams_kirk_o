About Us

















Founded in 1949, The Kirk Williams Company was founded by James “Kirk” Williams in 1949. The company began operating out of a small facility in downtown Columbus. Over time, specialty fabrication gave rise to mechanical contracting applications in commercial, industrial, institutional and health care markets.

 










 









Kirk invited his son, Jim, and son-in-law, John Ubbing, to join the company in the early 1950’s. Kirk, Jim and John were the foundation of the organization and were responsible for fostering the growth of the Kirk Williams Company. Jim’s son “JK” joined the firm full time in the mid 1970’s. JK’s brother Joe and sons Pat and Nic are poised to move the corporation into the future.
The company has made a conscious effort to invest in developing key relationships to deliver design-build and design-assist solutions in today’s fast paced construction environment. The Kirk Williams Company prides itself on being an experienced, dependable and multifaceted firm that focuses on finding solutions to our customers’ needs.
The Kirk Williams Company will continue a long-term focus as the fourth generation of owners and managers are active within the company. In order to be truly successful over time, the Kirk Williams Company will continue to operate with the strong values that have insured the success of our organization from its inception. That is our commitment to you, our customers, to continue to bring the quality and consistency that you have come to expect and deserve.

Williams Nursery started with a humble beginning as a family business, growing grape vines in the early 1970's. Since our beginning we have always highly valued our working relationships alongside the growers,                 respecting integrity and honor with a deep appreciation for God, family and community. Our nursery has been involved in growing and providing many of the new and cutting edge table grape varieties of their time since          we began: i.e. Ruby, Flame, Red Globe, Crimson, Autumn Royal, Princess, Summer Royal, and now the Sheehan Genetics varieties.
Williams Nursery is the exclusive agent to all U.S. and Mexico growers for the Sheehan Genetics varieties bred by the late Timothy P. Sheehan. Sheehan Genetics varieties are on the cutting edge becoming the next         generation of table grapes. The fruit speaks for itself, bringing superb qualities and characteristics to the table grape industry such as: excellent flavor, beautiful color, good sugar levels, great production,         return fruitfulness, good market timing, high solids, great texture, durable storage/shipping, even berry size and lower labor and material input which means less production cost for the grower. The Sheehan program         has a line up of green and red seedless grapes starting from the early season continuing all the way into the late season, not to mention that we represent some of the best seeded varieties in the industry as well.         All of the Sheehan varieties that we promote have been and still are grower tested and proven to be high quality marketable grapes.
Parting words of wisdom from the late Timothy Sheehan, "Grapes are for eating."
