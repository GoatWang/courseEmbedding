     The Statement on Schedule 13D dated September 25, 1995, as amended by
Amendment No. 1 dated November 16, 1995 (the "Schedule 13D") filed by B. Wayne  
Hughes relating to the units of limited partnership interest (the "Units") of   
Public Storage Properties, Ltd., a California limited partnership (the          
"Issuer"), is amended by this Amendment No. 2 as set forth below. Capitalized   
terms that are not defined herein have the meanings assigned to those terms in  
the Schedule 13D.                                                               

Item 1. Security and Issuer                                                     

Item 1 of the Schedule 13D is supplemented as follows:          

  The address of the principal executive office of the Issuer is 701
Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2397.                                

Item 2. Identity and Background                                                 

Item 2 of the Schedule 13D is supplemented as follows:          

      This Amendment No. 2 to Statement on Schedule 13D is filed by B. Wayne
Hughes and Tamara L. Hughes (collectively, the "Reporting Persons") pursuant to 
a Joint Filing Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.                          

        Mr. B. Wayne Hughes, a United States citizen, is a co-general partner of
the Issuer. Mr. Hughes is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 
of Public Storage, Inc., formerly known as Storage Equities, Inc. ("PSI"), a    
real estate investment trust which is the other co-general partner of the       
Issuer. Mr. Hughes' business address is 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California
91201-2397.  Mr. Hughes is the father of Tamara L. Hughes.                      

   Ms. Tamara L. Hughes, a United States citizen, is a Vice President-
Administration of PSI. Her business address is 701 Western Avenue, Glendale,    
California 91201-2397.                                                          

Because of the relationship between the Reporting Persons, such 
Reporting Persons may be deemed a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, each of the Reporting Persons  
disclaims that he or she constitutes such a group. In addition, except as       
otherwise disclosed herein, each Reporting Person claims beneficial ownership   
only of those Units set out following his or her name under Item 5 hereof and   
disclaims beneficial ownership of any Units covered by this Amendment No. 2 to  
Statement on Schedule 13D owned by any other Reporting Person. The filing of    
this Amendment No. 2 to Statement on Schedule 13D shall not be deemed an        
admission that the Reporting Persons constitute such a group or that a Reporting
Person is a beneficial owner of Units owned by any other Reporting Person.      

     During the last five years, neither the Reporting Persons nor, to the
best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, any executive officer, director or     
person controlling any Reporting Person, has been convicted in a criminal       
proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a 
party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent   
jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment,
decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or         
mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any
violation with respect to such laws.                                            

Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Compensation                        

Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is supplemented as follows:          

       Subsequent to the date of Amendment No. 1 to Statement on Schedule 13D,
B. Wayne Hughes acquired an additional 25 Units for an aggregate purchase price 
of $4,565 in cash, with funds obtained from Mr. Hughes' personal funds.         

       On October 1, 1997, Tamara L. Hughes acquired 80 Units for an aggregate
purchase price of $15,300 in cash, with funds obtained from Ms. Hughes' personal
funds.                                                                          

Item 4. Purpose of Transaction                                                  

Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is supplemented as follows:          

      The Reporting Persons have acquired the Units for investment purposes.
The Reporting Persons believe that the Units represent a good investment.       

    Although in the future the Reporting Persons or their affiliates may
acquire additional Units thereby increasing the Reporting Persons' ownership    
position in the Issuer, B. Wayne Hughes (a co-general partner of the Issuer) and
Tamara L. Hughes have no present plans or intentions with respect to the Issuer 
for a liquidation, a merger, a sale or purchase of material assets or borrowings
(other than a possible restructure of the existing property debt). No assets of 
the Issuer have been identified for sale.                                       

Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer                                    

Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is supplemented as follows:          

        As of October 1, 1997 and subsequent to that date through June 11, 1998,
each Reporting Person owned the aggregate number of Units set forth below       
opposite his or her name. Such Units constitute approximately 30.5%, in the     
aggregate, of the total number of Units outstanding of 20,000.                  

                                                       Approximate %

(a)  These Units are held of record by BWH Marina Corporation II ("BWH    
  Corp."), a corporation wholly-owned by Mr. Hughes. On November 16,
1995, Mr. Hughes granted to PSI an option to acquire and an     
      irrevocable proxy to vote 6,000 of these Units for a three-year period
  ending November 16, 1998, and therefore Mr. Hughes has no power to
   vote those 6,000 Units; Mr. Hughes has the sole power to dispose of
    those 6,000 Units, but Mr. Hughes has agreed not to dispose of those
  6,000 Units during the term of the option. Mr. Hughes has the sole
      power to vote and the sole power to dispose of the other 25 Units; see
     Item 6 below with respect to Mr. Hughes' grant of an option to PSI to
acquire these 25 Units.                                         

 (b)  Ms. Hughes has the sole power to vote and the sole power to dispose of
      all of these Units; see Item 6 below with respect to Ms. Hughes' grant
of an option to PSI to acquire these 80 Units.                  

      During the 60-day period ending October 1, 1997 and subsequent to that
date through June 11, 1998, the Reporting Persons purchased the number of Units 
in the transactions, on the transaction dates and at the prices per Unit (not

 On October 1, 1997, Tamara L. Hughes granted to PSI the option to
acquire from Tamara L. Hughes 80 Units for an aggregate exercise price equal to 
$15,300 plus Tamara L. Hughes' costs. Such option is exercisable at any time on

Malibu's Wealthy: Bradley Wayne Hughes
Bradley Wayne Hughes is one of Malibu's very successful businesspeople, with net worth estimated by Forbes as $3.2 billion in 2005.  Hughes founded and built the company Public Storage Inc. starting in 1972 with one warehouse location.  The Glendale-based company acquires, develops, owns and operates self-storage facilities at more than 1,000 locations in the United States and Canada.  Building on that success, on March 7, 2006  Public Storage announced the acquisition of Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. -- at a total transaction value of approximately $5.0 billion -- resulting in a combined total market capitalization of approximately $18 billion, with ownership interest in over 2,100 facilities in 38 states and seven European nations.
Additional interests include American Commercial Equities LLC, a Malibu-based investment firm of Public Storage Inc.  And, through its affiliate, PS Business Parks, Public Storage has an investment in more than 120 commercial properties in 11 states with 10 million square feet of space.
His 13,000-square-foot Malibu home is located in the Serra Retreat neighborhood where he lives with his family.  He continues to commute to Glendale, unusual for someone so mega-successful.
Hughes owns and breeds thoroughbred horses that race and win at the major tracks.  At home in Malibu, he maintains 14 of his horses on their ten acre property.  Other horses are spread among top trainers plus he keeps 16 broodmares at Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky.
As an active philanthropist, Hughes and family support cancer research and treatment, especially children's leukemia.  He donated $200 million to establish the Parker Hughes Cancer Center in St. Paul, MN, named for his late son.
In politics, Hughes made a $1 million contribution to California Gov. Schwarzenegger's election organization.
