KindredBio – Bringing the very best science and medicine to our companion animals














































































 

 


0Shopping Cart 







Our Commitment 
Making life better goes beyond the medicines we make.  It’s at the very core of our business.
Innovation through Insight
Delivering a deep pipeline through research, collaboration, and personal experience, to improve the lives of the ones  we love the most.


Our Mission


Our strategy is to bring the very best science and medicine to our animal companions. 


Best Medicines for Our Best Friends

As one of the first pet biotech companies in the world, we develop breakthrough medicines for dogs, cat and horses.

LEVERAGE PROVEN SCIENCE AND MOLECULESWe identify drugs, biologics, and targets that have been validated in humans and develop animal versions for pets. By leveraging the research and development investment in the existing human pharmaceuticals, doing so, we substantially increase the likelihood of success and decrease the cost and time required to develop breakthrough therapies for our animal family members.
FOCUS ON LEAN DEVELOPMENTWe have a world class team experienced in both human and veterinary medicine. We have selected best practices from both fields, and focus on lean development. As a result, we develop most of our drugs and biologics for between $3 million to $5 million and in only 3 to 5 years.
CREATE VALUE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERSOur goal is to transform veterinary medicine by developing best medicines for our best friends. By doing so, we believe we will create value for our patients, our veterinarians, employees, and shareholders.

Kindred Biosciences' stock drops after public stock offering
Shares of Kindred Biosciences Inc.  dropped 3.2% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the biotechnology company focused on pet health announced a public offering of stock to raise $22.5 million. The company said it was selling 3 million shares at $7.50 a share, which was 4.5% below Tuesday's closing price of $7.88. The share amount represents 12.7% of the total shares outstanding. Kindred has granted the underwriters options to buy an additional 450,000 shares of common stock. The offering is expected to close on July 17. Kindred plans to use the proceeds from the offering to expand its infrastructure in anticipation of product approvals and launches, for the development of drug candidates and general corporate purposes. The stock has soared 85% year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.3%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

KindredBio – Bringing the very best science and medicine to our companion animals

Our Commitment 
Making life better goes beyond the medicines we make.  It’s at the very core of our business.
Innovation through Insight
Delivering a deep pipeline through research, collaboration, and personal experience, to improve the lives of the ones  we love the most.


Our Mission


Our strategy is to bring the very best science and medicine to our animal companions. 


Best Medicines for Our Best Friends

As one of the first pet biotech companies in the world, we develop breakthrough medicines for dogs, cat and horses.

LEVERAGE PROVEN SCIENCE AND MOLECULESWe identify drugs, biologics, and targets that have been validated in humans and develop animal versions for pets. By leveraging the research and development investment in the existing human pharmaceuticals, doing so, we substantially increase the likelihood of success and decrease the cost and time required to develop breakthrough therapies for our animal family members.
FOCUS ON LEAN DEVELOPMENTWe have a world class team experienced in both human and veterinary medicine. We have selected best practices from both fields, and focus on lean development. As a result, we develop most of our drugs and biologics for between $3 million to $5 million and in only 3 to 5 years.
CREATE VALUE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERSOur goal is to transform veterinary medicine by developing best medicines for our best friends. By doing so, we believe we will create value for our patients, our veterinarians, employees, and shareholders.
