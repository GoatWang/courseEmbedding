Fort Knox, Kentucky, United States


Occupation

Racehorse owner
Casino Owner


Michael E. Pegram (born February 16, 1952 in Fort Knox, Kentucky) is the co-owner of the 2010 Preakness Stakes winner Lookin at Lucky and owner of the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Real Quiet. He grew up in Princeton, Indiana going to the races at Ellis Park Racecourse and Churchill Downs and dreamed of someday owning a Kentucky Derby winner. He also won the 1998 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies with Silverbulletday and after she was voted that year's Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Filly, came back in 1999 to win the Kentucky Oaks.
Among his other horses, Pegram owned Captain Steve, High Stakes Player, Queen of Money, Miss Gibson County, Wheeler Oil, Argolid, Favored One, Arches of Gold, Pussycat Doll, and The Texas Tunnel.
Pegram became successful as an owner of a number of McDonald's restaurant franchises in the state of Washington, a business that his father, Jim, had been involved with. Pegram has since moved his restaurant empire to Phoenix, where he lives part-time. Pegram also lives in Del Mar, California. He has three children: Amie and Tim Pegram and Tiffany Peach; and three brothers: Jim (a jockey agent), Demont, and Gil. Pegram also enjoyed success by winning the 2 million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Monmouth Park in 2007 with Midnight Lute, who trainer Bob Baffert stated was the best horse he'd ever brought to the Breeder's Cup. His champion returned the following year at Santa Anita Park to capture the same race, the first sprinter to ever do so.

Lettris






Lettris is a curious tetris-clone game where all the bricks have the same square shape but different content. Each square carries a letter. To make squares disappear and save space for other squares you have to assemble English words (left, right, up, down) from the falling squares. 



boggle
Boggle gives you 3 minutes to find as many words (3 letters or more) as you can in a grid of 16 letters. You can also try the grid of 16 letters. Letters must be adjacent and longer words score better. See if you can get into the grid Hall of Fame !

Michael E. Pegram (born February 16, 1952 in Fort Knox, Kentucky) is the co-owner of the 2010 Preakness Stakes winner Lookin at Lucky and owner of the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Real Quiet. He grew up in Princeton, Indiana going to the races at Ellis Park Racecourse and Churchill Downs and dreamed of someday owning a Kentucky Derby winner. He also won the 1998 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies with Silverbulletday and after she was voted that year's Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Filly, came back in 1999 to win the Kentucky Oaks.
Among his other horses, Pegram owned Captain Steve, High Stakes Player, Queen of Money, Miss Gibson County, Wheeler Oil, Argolid, Favored One, Arches of Gold, Pussycat Doll, and The Texas Tunnel.
Pegram became successful as an owner of a number of McDonald's restaurant franchises in the state of Washington, a business that his father, Jim, had been involved with. Pegram has since moved his restaurant empire to Phoenix, where he lives part-time. Pegram also lives in Del Mar, California. He has three children: Amie and Tim Pegram and Tiffany Peach; and three brothers: Jim (a jockey agent), Demont, and Gil. Pegram also enjoyed success by winning the 2 million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Monmouth Park in 2007 with Midnight Lute, who trainer Bob Baffert stated was the best horse he'd ever brought to the Breeder's Cup. His champion returned the following year at Santa Anita Park to capture the same race, the first sprinter to ever do so.
