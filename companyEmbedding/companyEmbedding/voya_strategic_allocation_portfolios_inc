How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Retirement News Release








 




Voya Financial Launches Wealth Portfolios Product, Expanding Advisory Program


THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016


WINDSOR, Conn., May 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA), announced today that its retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor Voya Financial Advisors, Inc., has launched the Voya Wealth Portfolios product, the latest addition to its suite of turnkey offerings available on the firm's WealthSolutions wealth management platform. As a result of this new advisory-focused solution, financial advisors affiliated with Voya Financial Advisors now have access to leading fund families and the ability to provide a best-in-class team approach to constructing investment portfolios. This strategy is focused on finding the right asset allocation mix to match a client's individual financial needs and risk tolerance. 
The Voya Wealth Portfolios product supports the firm's ongoing commitment to strengthen its advisory business, which grew by 30 percent during 2015. The new offering also provides an opportunity for advisors to deliver holistic support that can help clients get ready to retire better by planning, investing and protecting their savings. This reinforces Voya's efforts to further expand its advisory business.
"The introduction of Voya Wealth Portfolios provides an added opportunity for our advisors to focus on what matters most — deepening client relationships, building holistic financial plans and running their businesses," said Tom Halloran, president of Voya Financial Advisors. "As a leading broker-dealer and investment advisor in the industry, it's important that we arm our advisors with the right solutions to help their clients plan and feel confident about their future. In doing this, we are also positioning ourselves to be successful in the new regulatory environment while supporting our vision to be America's Retirement Company™."
Voya Wealth Portfolios is a turnkey solution that includes four different series of portfolios that are fully invested in a specific mutual fund company. These fund partners represent four leading brands in the industry with successful track records. Within each of the Voya Wealth Portfolios are five model options that advisors can work with to give them broad flexibility when building an investment portfolio for their clients.  
Advisors who operate with Voya Wealth Portfolios have access to an institutionally recognized sub-advisor known for robust research and investment consulting services. Working together with Voya Financial Advisors, the firm FDx Advisors provides investment and research support to help manage the asset allocation as well as the fiduciary risk in the fund selection for Voya Wealth Portfolios. With an objective of growth by generating interest, capital gains and dividends for individual accounts, each model maintains an appropriate risk level and is adjusted annually in response to changes in the market.
Since its launch, the Voya Wealth Portfolios offering is proving to be popular with advisors — even drawing new advisors to the advisory platform. "We've seen great interest among advisors," commented Andre Robinson, head of advisory services at Voya Financial Advisors. "Working together with FDx and the fund companies, we designed a solution that allows us to move commission-based accounts into advisory accounts with comparable funds. With this approach, portfolios are reviewed by fund managers that our advisors and clients have come to know and trust." 
Voya Wealth Portfolios also allows advisors to better integrate advisory solutions for clients with smaller accounts. Steve Dunlap, president and COO of FolioDynamix, noted, "Our team of research professionals worked closely with hand-picked investment managers to put the most optimal, innovative solution in place for Voya Financial Advisors. The Voya models are constructed and monitored based on risk-tolerance assessments to determine proper asset allocation, enabling advisors to offer a professionally managed advisory account option to investors of any size."
With the broad range of available models, advisors are able to align their clients with the investment portfolio that best suits their needs. "The decisions made with my clients on how to invest their funds may impact nearly every aspect of their lives down the road," noted Joe O'Boyle, a California-based advisor with Voya Financial Advisors. "With so much at stake, it's great to have a solution that can support their personalized goals while offering access to professionals with the extensive experience, tools and resources."  
In support of its expanding advisory business, Voya Financial Advisors also provides a "white glove" services team and suite of resources to assist advisors with all aspects of growing their advisory business, including support with best practices, case consultation, product and technology training, and conversion assistance.
Voya Financial Advisors is an independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor focused on helping advance the retirement readiness and financial security needs of Americans. For more information, visit www.voyafa.com.
As an industry leader and advocate for greater retirement readiness, Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its vision to be America's Retirement Company™ and its mission to make a secure financial future possible — one person, one family, one institution at a time.

Fund Description
OverviewThe Voya Strategic Allocation Portfolios are a suite of three actively managed asset allocation portfolios. The portfolios invest in a combination of underlying funds that in turn invest in varying degrees, among several classes of equities, fixed-income securities and money market instruments. It is important for investors to regularly assess their risk profile to ensure that they are invested in a diversified portfolio that appropriately meets their needs over time. The Voya Strategic Allocation Growth Portfolio invests in a combination of Underlying Funds that reflects an allocation of approximately 85% in equity securities and 15% in fixed-income securities. The Underlying Funds provide exposure to a wide range of traditional asset classes which includes stocks, bonds and cash and non-traditional asset classes (also known as alternative strategies) which includes real estate, commodities, floating rate loans and absolute return strategies. Absolute return strategies are intended to produce returns that are not correlated or are inversely correlated with equity index performance. Portfolio ObjectiveThe Portfolio seeks to provide capital appreciation.

View Detailed Performance





1The Adviser has contractually agreed to limit expenses of the Portfolio. This expense limitation agreement excludes interest, taxes, investment-related costs, leverage expenses, and extraordinary expenses and may be subject to possible recoupment. Please see the Portfolio's prospectus for more information. 				

					

2The expense limits will continue through at least May 1, 2018. Expenses are being waived to the contractual cap.
					

3The Portfolio's Acquired (Underlying) Funds Fees and Expenses are based on a weighted average of the fees and expenses of the Underlying Funds in which it invests. The amount of fees and expenses of the Underlying funds borne by a Portfolio will vary based on the Portfolio's allocation of assets to, and annualized net expenses of, the particular Underlying Funds during the Portfolio's fiscal year.
					


The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
		



Principal Risks
You could lose money on an investment in the Portfolio. The value of your investment in the Portfolio changes with the values of the Underlying Funds and their investments. Any of the following risks, among others, could affect the Portfolio’s or an Underlying Fund’s performance or cause the Portfolio or an Underlying Fund to lose money or to underperform market averages of other funds.Asset Allocation  Assets will be allocated among Underlying Funds and markets based on judgments by the Adviser or Sub-Adviser. There is a risk that the Portfolio may allocate assets to an Underlying Fund or asset class that underperforms other funds or asset classes.Call   During periods of falling interest rates, a bond issuer may “call” or repay its high-yielding bond before the bond’s maturity date. If forced to invest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, an Underlying Fund would experience a decline in income.Commodities  The operations and financial performance of companies in natural resources industries may be directly affected by commodity prices. This risk is exacerbated for those natural resources companies that own the underlying commodity.Company  The price of a given company’s stock could decline or underperform for many reasons including, among others, poor management, financial problems, or business challenges. If a company declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, its stocks could become worthless.Credit  Prices of bonds and other debt securities can fall if the issuer’s actual or perceived financial health deteriorates, whether because of broad economic or issuer-specific reasons. In severe cases, the issuer could be late in paying interest or principal, or could fail to pay altogether.Currency  To the extent that an Underlying Fund invests directly in foreign currencies or in securities denominated in, or that trade in, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies, it is subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged.Foreign Investments/Developing and Emerging Markets Investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Underlying Funds experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, and nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, foreign currency fluctuations, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign investment risks typically are greater in developing and emerging markets than in developed markets.High-Yield Securities  Investments rated below investment-grade (or of similar quality if unrated) are known as “high-yield securities” or “junk bonds.” High-yield securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks. High-yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer’s continuing ability to make principal and interest payments.Interest Rate  With bonds and other debt securities, a rise in interest rates generally causes values to fall; conversely, values generally rise as interest rates fall. The higher the credit quality of the security, and the longer its maturity or duration, the more sensitive it is likely to be to interest rate risk.Liquidity  If a security is illiquid, an Underlying Fund might be unable to sell the security at a time when the Underlying Fund’s manager might wish to sell, and the security could have the effect of decreasing the overall level of the Underlying Fund’s liquidity. Further, the lack of an established secondary market may make it more difficult to value illiquid securities, which could vary from the amount an Underlying Fund could realize upon disposition. An Underlying Fund may make investments that become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perception. An Underlying Fund could lose money if it cannot sell a security at the time and price that would be most beneficial to the Underlying Fund.Market  Stock prices are volatile and are affected by the real or perceived impacts of such factors as economic conditions and political events. The stock market tends to be cyclical, with periods when stock prices generally rise and periods when stock prices generally decline. Any given stock market segment may remain out of favor with investors for a short or long period of time, and stocks as an asset class may underperform bonds or other asset classes during some periods. From time to time, the stock market may not favor the growth- or value-oriented securities in which the Underlying Funds invest. Rather, the market could favor securities to which the Underlying Funds are not exposed or may not favor equities at all.Market Capitalization  Stocks fall into three broad market capitalization categories - large, mid and small. Investing primarily in one category carries the risk that, due to current market conditions, that category may be out of favor with investors. If valuations of large-capitalization companies appear to be greatly out of proportion to the valuations of mid- or small-capitalization companies, investors may migrate to the stocks of mid- and small-sized companies causing the Underlying Funds that invest in these companies to increase in value more rapidly than a fund that invests in larger, fully-valued companies. Investing in mid- and small-capitalization companies may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines, more limited financial resources, smaller management groups, and a more limited trading market for their stocks as compared with larger companies. As a result, stocks of mid- and small-capitalization companies may decline significantly in market downturns.Other Investment Companies  The main risk of investing in other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, is the risk that the value of the securities underlying an investment company might decrease. Because the Portfolio or an Underlying Fund may invest in other investment companies, you will pay a proportionate share of the expenses of that other investment company (including management fees, administration fees and custodial fees) in addition to the expenses of the Portfolio and a proportionate share of the expenses of each Underlying Fund. Proprietary Hedge Fund Beta Strategy  Because the Portfolio allocates assets to an Underlying Fund that seeks to deliver returns that approximate the beta component of the broad universe of hedge fund returns, the Portfolio’s performance may be lower than the returns of the broader stock market.Real Estate Companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”)  Investing in real estate companies and REITs may subject an Underlying Fund to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including losses from casualty or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and operating expenses, in addition to terrorist attacks, war or other acts that destroy real property.Short Exposures  The Portfolio may invest in an Underlying Fund that takes short exposure on market indices by investing in an instrument or derivative that rises in value with a fall in the related index. If the price of the index rises while an Underlying Fund has a short exposure to it, the Underlying Fund may have to cover its short exposure at a loss. Short exposures are subject to credit risks related to the counterparty’s ability to perform its obligations and further that any deterioration in the counterparty’s creditworthiness could adversely affect the value of the instrument or derivative. The potential loss on a short exposure is unlimited because the loss increases as the price of the instrument sold short increases.

nR2
The way in which a percentage of a portfolio's total returns represents the portfolio's beta measure.


nBeta3Year
Measures the Fund's volatility relative to the overall market. A beta above 1 is more volatile than the overall market, while a beta below 1 is less volatile.
