The Xunlei download manager, generally called Xunlei, is the flagship product of Xunlei Corporation, which also supports Xunlei Kankan, a video-on-demand website, and other desktop software. Xunlei is the most popular download software in China.
Xunlei[edit]
Through Xunlei, users can access a large portion of the files available on the Internet. Features in Xunlei includes a built-in browser, changeable skins, cloud storage, "offline" downloading, hi-speed downloading (only available for members), email service and more.
Xunlei is accompanied by a family of products including Xunlei 5, Mac Xunlei, Xunlei Mini, and Web Xunlei. As adware, Xunlei products feature banner advertisements, which can be disabled if logged in as a user (in the latest version).
Xunlei Kankan[edit]
Xunlei Kankan, also known as Kankan, is a video-on-demand service with a web interface as well as a client application. Xunlei Kankan is also available on mobile platforms including Android and iOS (including iPhone and Kankan HD for iPad).
Others[edit]
Along with Xunlei 7 and Kankan, the company also produces software such as a gaming client, a graphics editor, game "accelerator", software manager, and a web photo viewer.
Concerns and criticisms[edit]
File sharing[edit]
Xunlei is different from P2P tools in that it does not support active file sharing. While copyright advocates view Xunlei as a P2P tool that facilitates copyright violation, P2P advocates criticize Xunlei as a leech with much more downloading than uploading. Also it is often observed that Xunlei prioritizes file sharing with Xunlei users rather than other client users. Many pure P2P tools have blocked Xunlei, although this trend weakened after Xunlei began balancing the number of downloads and uploads.
Xunlei sets up its own storage servers to backup the files which are not active or shared any longer. This feature is named as High-Speed Channel and allows Xunlei users retrieve data faster than others. But only paying users have access to these servers and download files.
Direct linking[edit]
Direct linking, or leeching, concerns many site owners, who may feel that the practice benefits Xunlei at their sites' expense. In 2006, Huajun, the leading download site in China, started blocking Xunlei along with many other downloading sites.
User agent imitation[edit]
Since many websites recognized and blocked Xunlei via user agent (UA) string, Xunlei began to use common browsers' UA as camouflage. The default UA is: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) or Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6. However, if Xunlei determines it is blocked from a website, it will automatically change UA to imitate other browsers, such as: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729)
Privacy[edit]
Xunlei shares files by default without additional notifications after installation. While Xunlei argues that this behavior is a common convention and that users can disable it, some users are still worried, since Xunlei's sharing policy is unclear. Investigations[by whom?] have revealed that Xunlei only shares files downloaded through Xunlei.[citation needed] Moving or renaming files may automatically disable sharing.[clarification needed]

The Xunlei download manager, generally called Xunlei, is the flagship product of Xunlei Corporation, which also supports Xunlei Kankan, a video-on-demand website, and other desktop software. Xunlei is the most popular download software in China.
Xunlei[edit]
Through Xunlei, users can access a large portion of the files available on the Internet. Features in Xunlei includes a built-in browser, changeable skins, cloud storage, "offline" downloading, hi-speed downloading (only available for members), email service and more.
Xunlei is accompanied by a family of products including Xunlei 5, Mac Xunlei, Xunlei Mini, and Web Xunlei. As adware, Xunlei products feature banner advertisements, which can be disabled if logged in as a user (in the latest version).
Xunlei Kankan[edit]
Xunlei Kankan, also known as Kankan, is a video-on-demand service with a web interface as well as a client application. Xunlei Kankan is also available on mobile platforms including Android and iOS (including iPhone and Kankan HD for iPad).
Others[edit]
Along with Xunlei 7 and Kankan, the company also produces software such as a gaming client, a graphics editor, game "accelerator", software manager, and a web photo viewer.
Concerns and criticisms[edit]
File sharing[edit]
Xunlei is different from P2P tools in that it does not support active file sharing. While copyright advocates view Xunlei as a P2P tool that facilitates copyright violation, P2P advocates criticize Xunlei as a leech with much more downloading than uploading. Also it is often observed that Xunlei prioritizes file sharing with Xunlei users rather than other client users. Many pure P2P tools have blocked Xunlei, although this trend weakened after Xunlei began balancing the number of downloads and uploads.
Xunlei sets up its own storage servers to backup the files which are not active or shared any longer. This feature is named as High-Speed Channel and allows Xunlei users retrieve data faster than others. But only paying users have access to these servers and download files.
Direct linking[edit]
Direct linking, or leeching, concerns many site owners, who may feel that the practice benefits Xunlei at their sites' expense. In 2006, Huajun, the leading download site in China, started blocking Xunlei along with many other downloading sites.
User agent imitation[edit]
Since many websites recognized and blocked Xunlei via user agent (UA) string, Xunlei began to use common browsers' UA as camouflage. The default UA is: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) or Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6. However, if Xunlei determines it is blocked from a website, it will automatically change UA to imitate other browsers, such as: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729)
Privacy[edit]
Xunlei shares files by default without additional notifications after installation. While Xunlei argues that this behavior is a common convention and that users can disable it, some users are still worried, since Xunlei's sharing policy is unclear. Investigations[by whom?] have revealed that Xunlei only shares files downloaded through Xunlei.[citation needed] Moving or renaming files may automatically disable sharing.[clarification needed]

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately US$89.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. In addition, 
we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately US$9.7 million from the 
concurrent private placement, after deducting expenses incurred by us in 
connection with this investment. These estimates are based upon an assumed 
initial offering price of US$15.00 per ADS, the midpoint of the estimated 
initial public offering price range shown on the front cover page of this 
prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by 
the selling shareholders. A US$1.00 change in the assumed initial public 
offering price of US$15.00 per ADS would, in the case of an increase, 
increase and, in the case of a decrease, decrease the net proceeds of this 
offering by US$6.9 million, assuming (1) the sale of 6,675,000 ADSs at 
US$15.00 per ADS, the midpoint of the range shown on the front cover page 
of this prospectus and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, and (2) the issuance and 
sale of 2,000,000 Class A common shares we will issue in the private 
placement concurrently with this offering, which numbers of shares has been 
calculated based on an initial offering price of US$15.00 per ADS, the 
midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range shown on the 
front cover page of this prospectus, after deducting expenses incurred by 
us in connection with this investment. 

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain and attract talented 
employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional 
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent 
private placement as follows: 

• US$20.0 million to establish a customer service center and cloud computing 
  data centers to better serve our subscribers; 

• US$20.0 million to acquire digital media content and exclusive online game 
  licenses; 

• US$10.0 million to invest in technology, infrastructure and product 
  development efforts; and 

• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including working capital 
needs and potential acquisitions (although we are not currently negotiating 
any such acquisitions). 

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount 
of cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological 
developments and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, 
we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described in 
this prospectus. 

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide 
funding to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entities only 
through loans or capital contributions, and only if we satisfy the applicable 
government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that 
we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at all.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand 
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.


Due to our multiple service offerings, we face competition in several 
aspects of the internet services market in China. We believe that the key 
competitive factors in the overall internet services market in China include 
brand recognition, user traffic, technology platform and monetization 
abilities. 

Our Xunlei Downloader primarily competes with e-Mule, FlashGet and Tencent 
(QQ Cyclone). Our Xunlei Kankan website primarily competes with other major 
online video companies in China such as Youku.com and Tudou.com. In 
addition, we also face competition for the advertisement budgets of our 
advertisers from other internet companies and other forms of media.


Company Description
We are a leading consumer internet platform for digital media content in 
China. We operate a powerful platform based on cloud computing that enables 
internet users to access and manage digital content. Our platform combines 
our proprietary digital media indexing technology and a massively


 distributed 
computing network that connects 291 million active users in February 2011, 
according to iResearch, as well as over one million third-party servers and 
over 3,600 servers owned by us as of March 31, 2011. Under our leading Xunlei 
brand, we provide digital media download and streaming services. Our mission 
is to build a one-stop consumer-centric platform to enable faster, more 
reliable and more efficient transmission and management of digital content 
across multiple internet-enabled devices. 

As broadband penetration increases in China, various types of digital media 
content have been made available online, including popular software, 
byte-heavy online games, and high definition movies and TV series which in 
turn results in increasing demand for internet access. However, access to 
internet content has become relatively slow and less reliable in China due to 
the growing internet user base. To address this issue, we launched a series 
of download and streaming services empowered by our platform. 

We first launched our core download acceleration software, Xunlei Downloader, 
in 2004, which gradually evolved into the central interface for a growing 
collection of premium download-related services designed to further enhance 
our users' download experience. The core download acceleration functionality 
makes Xunlei Downloader the most popular download acceleration application 
in China, with a 78.7% market share based on the number of software launches 
among all download software in China in February 2011, according to iResearch. 
Xunlei Downloader was used in an average of approximately 138 million 
downloads per day in 2010. These downloads are available to internet users 
free of charge. To complement our download services and to further broaden 
our users' access to video content via online streaming, we also launched 
our online video streaming services in 2007 on our Xunlei Kankan website. 
Xunlei Kankan is the third largest video streaming portal in China, as 
measured by the monthly unique visitors from homes and offices in April 2011 
according to iResearch. Xunlei Kankan had 120.7 million monthly unique 
visitors from homes and offices in April 2011.

Both Xunlei's digital media download and streaming services are based on our 
resource discovery network, which is designed to utilize our proprietary 
digital media indexing technology. Our resource discovery network is based on 
our distributed computing architecture, which is constructed from all Xunlei 
Downloader clients that are running on and connected to the internet at any 
given time, along with the universe of server addresses stored in our digital 
media file index database. Our distributed computing power enhances our user 
experience and reduces our bandwidth and other infrastructure-related costs 
when providing services on a massive scale. 

We generate revenues from multiple sources, including cloud-based 
subscription services, online advertising, and other services. Multiple 
revenue streams provide us with both revenue diversification and multiple 
growth areas. We implemented our current cloud-based subscription service 
revenue model in March 2009 and, by the end of March 2011, we had developed 
over 1.3 million subscribers from the large user base of Xunlei Downloader 
and Xunlei Kankan. We also generate online advertising revenues derived 
principally from various forms of advertisements that we place on Xunlei 
Kankan and Xunlei Downloader. 

We have experienced significant growth in recent years. Our revenues 
increased from US$16.8 million in 2008 to US$29.6 million in 2009 and to 
US$42.8 million in 2010, representing a compound annual growth rate, or 
CAGR, of 59.7%, while we had a net loss attributable to Xunlei of US$4.6 
million in 2008 and achieved net income attributable to Xunlei of US$5.4 
million and US$8.5 million in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Our revenues 
increased by 98.1% from US$7.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 
2010 to US$15.4 million for the same period in 2011, and net income 
attributable to Xunlei increased by 22.1% from US$1.5 million for the three 
months ended March 31, 2010 to US$1.9 million for the same period in 2011. 
In April 2011, we granted options to purchase 841,784 common shares to our 
employees. The vesting period of most of these options is four years.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately US$78.2 million, or US$90.4 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain and attract talented
employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional
capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

.    US$10.0 million to invest in technology, infrastructure and product
     development efforts;

.    US$10.0 million to acquire digital media content and exclusive online game
     licenses; and

.    the balance for other general corporate purposes, including working capital
     needs and potential acquisitions.

The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and
the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an
unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds
of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest
entities only through loans or capital contributions, and only if we satisfy the
applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to meet these requirements on a timely basis, if at
all. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.


Due to our multiple service offerings, we face competition in several aspects of
the internet services market in China. We believe that the key competitive
factors in the overall internet services market in China include brand
recognition, user traffic, technology platform and monetization abilities.

Our Xunlei Accelerator would primarily compete with Tencent (QQ Cyclone) and
Baidu. Our Xunlei Kankan website primarily competes with other major online
video websites in China such as Youku.com, Tudou.com and iQiyi.com. In addition,
we also face competition for the advertisement budgets of our advertisers from
other internet companies and other forms of media.


Company Description
We are one of the top 10 largest Chinese internet companies, as measured by user
base. According to iResearch, we had an average of approximately 300 million
monthly unique visitors for the three months ended on March 31, 2014. Digital
media content, such as video, music and games, is one of the


 most popular usages
for internet users in China. We operate a powerful internet platform in China
based on cloud computing to enable users to quickly access, manage, and consume
digital media content. We are increasingly extending to mobile devices in part
through potentially pre-installed acceleration products in mobile phones and to
living rooms through TV coverage (set-top boxes and IPTV) to further expand our
user base and offer our users a wider range of access points. We aspire to
deliver superior user experience in ease of access, management and consumption
of digital media content anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

We are the No. 1 acceleration product provider in China as measured by market
share in March 2014, according to iResearch. To address deficiencies of digital
media transmission over the internet in China, such as low speed and high
delivery failure rates, we provide users with quick and easy access to online
digital media content through two core products and services:

.   Xunlei Accelerator, which enables users to accelerate digital transmission
    over the internet, is our most popular and free product, with approximately 
    142 million monthly active users and approximately 204 million monthly 
    unique visitors in March 2014, according to the iResearch Report. Xunlei 
    Accelerator enjoys a market share of 84.1% based on the number of launches 
    among all transmission and acceleration products in China in March 2014, 
    according to iResearch; and

.   Our cloud acceleration subscription services, delivered through products
    such as Green Channel, Offline Accelerator and Yunbo, offer users premium
    services for speed and reliability, with approximately 5.2 million
    subscribers as of March 31, 2014, up from approximately 1.1 million as of
    January 31, 2011.

Benefitting from the large user base for our core product, Xunlei Accelerator,
we have further developed various value-added services to meet a fuller spectrum
of our users' digital media content access and consumption needs including:

.   Xunlei Kankan, the 6th largest online video streaming platform in China,
    with monthly unique visitors of approximately 136.0 million in March 2014,
    according to iResearch. Users can watch what they want for free from our
    comprehensive content library;

.   Pay per view services, launched in the second half of 2012 and serving
    approximately 155,000 subscribers as of March 31, 2014, providing them with
    access to our premium content library of over 800 movies, primarily new
    releases. As of March 31, 2014, about 58% of our pay per view subscribers
    are also subscribers for our premium acceleration services, presenting
    opportunities for further cross-selling; and

.   Online game services, including web games and massive multiplayer online
    games, or MMOGs, offered on our gaming platform.

We are increasingly expanding our services to living room based internet devices
and mobile devices, as part of our cloud-based home and mobile strategies.
Starting in 2013, we began to pre-install our acceleration products in set-top
boxes distributed by third-party hardware providers. As of March 31, 2014, we
had accumulated an installed base of approximately 1,552,000 set-top boxes
across China. We believe our living room strategy combined with our success on
PC internet will provide a seamless user experience to access digital media
content from any device. We also target to make our mobile applications the
central user interface for accessing and managing digital media content in a
synchronized manner. Since 2012, we have entered into pre-installment service
agreements with several mobile phone manufacturers, including a Xiaomi group
company, pursuant to which we agree to provide our Xunlei mobile acceleration
applications, and the mobile phone manufacturers agree to install such
applications on their phones, free of charge. Xiaomi is a well-recognized smart
phone brand in China and once such pre-installment arrangements are implemented,
Xiaomi phone users will have access to our acceleration services, which could
enhance our ability to generate more user traffic. These strategies and our
compelling value proposition will provide us with the foundation to further grow
our user base and allow our customers to access and enjoy digital media content
regardless of device or location.

The technological backbone of our products and services is our cloud
acceleration technology, comprised of a proprietary file locating system and
massive file index database. Our technology enables us to support greater user
expansion with incremental increases in server and bandwidth costs. This
technology, based on distributed computing architecture, along with our indexing
technology, enables users to access content in an efficient manner.

We have successfully monetized our large user base. We generate revenues
primarily through the following services:

.   Cloud subscription services. We provide premium acceleration services for
    subscribers to enable faster and more reliable access to digital media
    content;

.   Online advertising services. We offer advertising services by providing
    marketing opportunities on our online video streaming websites and platform
    to our advertisers; and

.   Other internet value-added services. We offer multiple other value-added
    services to our users, including online games and pay per view services.
