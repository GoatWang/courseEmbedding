Foodservice Chemicals

Swisher offers a complete line of chemicals for foodservice operators, offering you an affordable and effective alternative to traditional chemical suppliers. Our products all perform as well as or better than any other on the market, and our weekly delivery means that you’re always properly stocked. Plus, we have low order minimums and will even break cases where necessary, so you never spend more than you have to or wind up with chemicals you don’t really want.
Concentrated Chemicals 
Active foodservice operations can benefit significantly from the use of concentrated chemicals. Swisher’s concentrate provides the lowest use cost available, in many cases as much as 90% less than retail prices, and frequently 20% - 50% less expensive than other chemical providers.
Moreover, our 3-compartment sink dispensers and wall-mounted dilution systems are simple and safe to operate, making concentrate as easy to use as ready-mixed product.
Operators with smaller-scale needs can take advantage of our ready-to-use products. They perform to the same high standards you expect from Swisher, and their packaging is exceptionally convenient for dealing with hygiene issues wherever and whenever they happen to arise.
Best of all, our selection is as complete as you’ll find anywhere, including such products as:





• No-rinse sanitizer
• Spray cleaner/degreaser
• Neutral pH cleaner

• Foaming meat room cleaner
• All purpose cleaner
• Stainless Steel Polish

• Heavy duty degreaser
• Mild acidic restroom disinfectant
• Non-acid soap scum remover
• Disinfectant cleaner
• Heavy-duty restroom cleaner

• Non-acid restroom disinfectant
• Odor neutralizer
• Concentrated, clear formula cleaner/maintainer
• Bioactive enzyme floor cleaner
• Pot and pan detergent

Swisher Hygiene Inc. is a sanitation company in the United States which until 2015 traded on the NASDAQ . Originally a janitorial service company, two-thirds of its revenue are now generated by selling cleaning and sanitizing chemicals.[2]
History[edit]
Swisher was founded by Patrick Swisher to provide cleaning products and services for restaurants and other businesses. In November 2004, Fort Lauderdale, Florida entrepreneurs Wayne Huizenga and Steve Berrard bought the firm for a reported $14 million.[2]
Huizenga and Berrard paid Patrick $8.1 million for more than 900,000 shares to obtain a majority stake in the company.[3] They operated Swisher as a private company until November 2, 2010, when Swisher became publicly traded through a reverse takeover of CoolBrands International Inc.
CoolBrands was once a major frozen food and dessert manufacturer based in Markham, Ontario. Due to financial problems, it had sold its core operating businesses (including Breyers yoghurt, Eskimo Pie and Chipwich) in 2007 and was little more than an empty corporate shell, but was still listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Swisher, through the reverse takeover, acquired the strength of CoolBrands' balance sheet and CoolBrands' status as a publicly traded enterprise.
As a publicly traded company, Swisher could pay in stock or partially in stock for acquisitions of other companies. It went on an acquisition spree in 2011, purchasing 54 different businesses nominally valued at $220 million.[2] The acquisitions increased gross revenue but did not bring the company to profitability.[4]
Swisher had purchased Fort Lauderdale-based Choice Environmental Services in February 2011 for $50 million in stock and an assumption of $41.5 million in debt.[5] Glenn Miller and Neal Rodrigue, the former owners of Choice Environmental Services, had become the fourth-largest shareholders in Swisher under a merger agreement but were restricted from selling any of their shares, causing them substantial losses when the stock plummeted.[6] They later sued.
The company had to re-state its 2011 financial information due to accounting irregularities, increasing that year's losses by $4.8 million before taxes.[2] It incurred repeated quarterly losses through much of 2012, a year for which it missed Toronto Stock Exchange deadlines for both quarterly and annual financial reports.[7][8] At one point, NASDAQ had threatened to de-list the stock due to reporting delays.[9]
On November 15, 2012 Swisher sold Choice Environmental Services to Waste Services of Florida for $125,000,000 in cash, using the money to repay debt.[5]
The company's losses extended into 2012 and 2013.[10] Thomas Byrne, previously president of Viacom and vice-chairman of Blockbuster Video, became Swisher's Interim President and CEO in February 2013 in an attempt to turn the company around.[2] Wayne Huizenga, who worked with Byrne at Blockbuster, became Chairman of the Board. The company's stock by mid-year was trading below a dollar a share[11] and the company lost $3/share in 2013, losses which continued into 2014.[12]
On June 4, 2014 a reverse stock split replaced every ten existing shares in Swisher with one new share, as the company had to be brought out of penny stock territory and back above $1/share to retain a NASDAQ listing.[13] As of July 2014[update] the stock was trading slightly above $4/share.
On Nov 2, 2015 the company's US operations were sold to EcoLab for $40.2 million and the company no longer has operating assets or revenue producing operations in the US.

Swisher Launches Innovative Bed Bug Product
Shield RTP to Help Businesses Combat Insect Infestations



















August 28, 2013 08:00 ET

 | Source: Swisher Hygiene Inc.





CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug. 28, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Swisher Hygiene Inc. ("Swisher") (Nasdaq:SWSH) (TSX:SWI), a leading provider of essential hygiene and sanitizing products and services, today announced the launch of Shield RTP (Ready to Protect), an easy-to-use insecticide engineered to eliminate bed bugs and its relatives on contact and provide lasting residual control.

	Available in a 32-ounce spray bottle, Shield RTP uses naturally derived oils and plant extracts to safely and effectively eradicate the insects commonly found in and around bedding, sofas, chairs, carpets, rugs, cabinets, sinks, walls and luggage. Once applied, Shield RTP's non-toxic, non-flammable spray creates a chemical barrier stopping bed bug pests in their tracks, with the added benefit of reducing the chances of additional infestations.

	"The introduction of Shield RTP helps expand the full suite of products we can provide to our customers," said Thomas C. Byrne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Swisher. "With the considerable increase over the last few years in bed bug outbreaks, we believe there is a particular need for this type of product in the hospitality industry."

	Certified by the Food and Drug Administration as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), Shield RTP is designed for use in a variety of highly populated environments such as hotels, airports, restaurants, schools, healthcare facilities and more. With the release of Shield RTP, Swisher provides business owners with a fast, affordable option to combat the documented rise of bedbugs across the United States.

	To learn more about Shield RTP, contact a Swisher representative by calling 1.800.360.SWSH or by emailing customercare@swsh.com.

About Us
There's a reason why Swisher is a respected name in the cleaning products and services industry: we invented it. We started back in 1986 with the conviction that business people would welcome the opportunity to have their facilities maintained by a true specialist, and the response has been overwhelming.
It's not surprising. Matters of cleaning products and services are too important to be left to anyone but an expert. Businesses that require their employees to maintain their facilities get the level of service they pay for. And those who count on conglomerates that try to be everything to everyone too often wind up with superficial work at best.
At Swisher, we concentrate on one thing and one thing only: commercial solutions.
We deliver a wide a range of customized cleaning programs and innovative products that make us the industry's only true partner to help deliver clean, safe results:* A complete set of products and programs at industry-leading prices* Concentrated and ready-to-use foodservice chemicals* Dishmachines available for purchase, rent or lease* Warewashing products and service, including emergency service* Kitchen soap, sanitizers and antibacterial products* Floorcare products and drainline treatments
