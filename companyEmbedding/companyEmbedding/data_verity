Easy. Versatile. Trustworthy



Easy – Designed with humans in mind, Verity is intuitive and easy for voters and election officials to use.

Versatile – Verity’s uniquely flexible hardware and software approach means the system adapts as your needs change.

Trustworthy – Comprehensive audit logs and reports shed light on user activity and build stakeholder confidence.

	All Verity components are based on a single integrated platform, providing user-friendly end-to-end election management for all voting types.

At the polling place. Voters scan their paper ballots on the Verity Scan digital scanning device.  Voters with disabilities mark their ballots on the accessible Verity Touch Writer ballot marking device; then scan them, along with other voters’ ballots, using Verity Scan. For electronic voting, voters use the Verity Touch DRE device.

Absentee and by-mail ballots. Verity Central is a scalable, high-speed scanning solution that uses Hart-integrated COTS scanners at affordable price points. Verity Central eliminates the need for pre-sorting ballots as it scans and records cast vote records. And Verity Central's second-generation onscreen adjudication features make it easy for election officials to quickly and accurately resolve questionable ballot marks.

Election management. The Verity Data and Verity Build software applications enable election officials to import and manage election data, design ballots and define and deploy elections, all within a single, unified, user-friendly workflow - no coding skills required. The Verity Count tabulation and reporting software provides standard and customized reports on a wide variety of cast vote record and audit information gathered from other voting system components. Verity Count's user-friendly dashboards enable election officials to monitor progress on Election Night, or to perform post-election audits, in a highly filterable way.

 Degausser Comparison








Why Use Hard Drive Degaussers?
Hard drives are robust storage mediums. Nowadays, anyone can send a drive to a data recovery company to retrieve the vast majority of ‘deleted’ data. Furthermore many manufacturers are now engineering hard drives to include data retrieval processes.
To remove data from a hard drive to the point where the previous data is entirely unrecoverable, only by degaussing a hard drive will it be sufficient. Degaussers erase data by randomizing the magnetic charge of a hard drive using a powerful magnetic field. This field completely destroys any resemblance of previously recorded data.
Degaussing is a permanent method of data erasure, and the most widely recognized high-security method of disposal. You cannot use a hard drive after it’s been degaussed. This is because degaussing will also destroy the start-up program hard-coded into the hard drive, known as firmware. For more information, see our introduction to degaussers.


Government Approved Degaussers
The NSA, DOD and the UK National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC (Formally CESG) only approve degausser equipment that can ensure total data erasure of highly sensitive, classified material. These degaussers are rigorously evaluated before they are able to meet government performance requirements.
Generally, degausser strength is rated by a magnetic property called “gauss” or “coercivity”. Our SDD Master triple pulse degausser is rated at 20,000 gauss – generating the strongest erasure field of any degausser on the market.
Any organization involved in managing critical, confidential information, such as financial, medical, military or legal information must take great care in how they deal with the erasure of such data. In many of these cases, the use of an approved degausser is highly recommended.

With over 30 years’ experience designing and manufacturing degaussers, VS Security Products has built a trusted reputation worldwide as the market leader for data destruction and erasure technology.
