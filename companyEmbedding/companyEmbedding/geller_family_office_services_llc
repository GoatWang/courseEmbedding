 Career History



Chief Compliance Officer & Chief Financial Officer

                                    2013 - Prior                


Geller Family Office Services LLC


                  Geller Family Office Services' asset allocation recommendations are based on a customized, comprehensive financial plan that is based on each client's individual objectives, time horizons, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and liquidity needs. They stress-test potential strategic allocations through the imposition of historical scenarios, during which the risks of loss in securities and the potential for all asset classes to perform similarly are observed. This process also establishes the degree to which portions of the portfolio can have limited liquidity. Portfolio construction typically involves establishing a risk-appropriate allocation among cash, fixed income, global equities and alternatives, such as hedge funds where appropriate. Global equity allocations are usually indexed to varying degrees in a \"\"core and satellite\"\" structure. The satellite managers typically have concentrated holdings and may exhibit meaningful divergence from their benchmarks. In addition, such a plan can support selective use of alternative investments, appropriately sized to meet individual liquidity needs. Geller Family Office may allocate a client’s assets among several third party investment managers, which may include mutual funds, separate account managers, hedge funds, private equity and other investments and ETFs. Client portfolio holdings may also include individual equities and fixed income, option contracts, warrants, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Portfolio weighting among third party investment managers and other investments is determined by each client's asset allocation.

        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

Geller & Company Names Joe Calabrese CEO of Geller Family Office Services Business

NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Geller & Company, a premier strategic financial advisory firm, today announced that Joe Calabrese has been named Chief Executive Officer of Geller Family Office Services LLC (GFOS), the firm's family office and wealth advisory business.  In his role as CEO, Mr. Calabrese will work closely with Martin Geller, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Geller & Company, and the GFOS leadership team to further develop and shape the business' operations and strategic direction.  
Mr. Calabrese joins Geller & Company from Harris myCFO, the multifamily-office unit of BMO Private Bank and one of the nation's leading integrated wealth management and independent investment advisory firms for high-net-worth individuals and families.  He most recently served as President and CEO of Harris myCFO, setting the strategic direction for growth and delivery excellence, and managing the firm's largest family relationships.  Mr. Calabrese has extensive experience providing integrated advisory services across all facets of wealth, including investments; trusts and estates; tax planning; philanthropy; family education; capital advisory; risk management and insurance advisory; and financial reporting and expense management.   
Martin Geller said, "We are delighted to welcome an executive of Joe Calabrese's caliber as the new CEO of GFOS.  Joe has an exceptional record of industry leadership and of consistently providing clients with first-class service and results. Throughout his distinguished career, Joe's vision and initiatives spurred tremendous growth for his respective organizations.  At Harris myCFO, Joe built significant brand presence, forged a business culture that attracted top talent and assembled client-focused teams dedicated to the advocacy of client interests in all wealth matters."
Mr. Geller continued, "Bringing Joe to GFOS is an important step in ensuring that the organization is well-positioned to continuously enhance its capabilities, performance and service level for each of our clients."
Mr. Calabrese said, "It is a privilege to become part of the Geller organization and to lead an outstanding team of GFOS professionals as we work together to expand the firm's highly respected advisory platform.  The most critical differentiator for success in the niche high-net-worth advisory space is the ability to consistently understand each client's distinct expectations and to provide exceptional service and results.  That is exactly what Geller has done throughout its history and we will build on that impressive legacy."
Mr. Calabrese will lead a GFOS team comprised of more than 60 professionals with extensive experience in family office and wealth advisory, including ultra-high-net-worth investment advisory, tax, estate and trust planning, CFO advisory services and concierge services.  As of June 2013, based on the efforts of this team, GFOS had in excess of $5 billion in assets under advisement (AUA).
To continue to capitalize on its success Geller has enhanced its talent base by retaining top talent and continually hiring high-quality professionals in various aspects of its business.  GFOS has been significantly strengthened through a number of recent key hires, including Rob Wedeking as Chief Investment Officer, Tricia Levin as Partner in Charge of Tax Services and Stan Trotta as Director of Family Office Tax.  Geller & Company also named Jerry Leamon, former Global Managing Director for Deloitte, as Vice Chairman of its Advisory Board.  Each of these individuals has had a long and successful career and has been extremely successful in working in Geller's collaborative culture and helping the continuous strengthening of the organization.
Mr. Calabrese is a Chartered Accountant with a joint honors degree in Economics and Finance from McGill University.
