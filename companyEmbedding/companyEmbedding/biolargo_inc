BioLargo Story

The Beginning
Kenneth Reay Code, the ‘Inventor’, entrusted with the BioLargo Technology, began this journey of ours over 10 years ago when his father had a severe stroke and was left severely impaired, bed ridden or wheel chair confined and in need of long-term convalescent care. Out of concern for his father’s great risk of secondary infection, Ken set out to find a way to extend his father’s life expectancy and improve his quality of life by reducing his risk of contracting disease and by reducing compounding risks of secondary infections that are so common in long-term care facilities.
Through his scientific trials of blending low dose inorganic chemical compounds and absorbent materials he made what may just be called a “genuine discovery”.
When the BioLargo Technology is incorporated into products, many of which are already widely known and in use, those products become an effective tool in stopping the transmission of life threatening disease.
“All we had to do was figure out how to apply these naturally occurring compounds to products so they could do what they were created to do and put them to use out in the field where disease is most prevalent”.  – Kenneth Reay Code
Kenneth Reay Code Performs Quality Assurance
The company has expanded the original technology to now include long list product designs and delivery systems keeping the original mission intact, to, “Make Life Better”.  
The company has a broad base of science and technology to impact our: 
Water – Air – Food – Plants – Animals – People
Making them Clean Safe & Healthy
BioLargo Technology
Disclaimer: The products in which the BioLargo Technology can be used include both regulated and unregulated uses and applications. Certain specific regulated applications and its use therein require highly technical analysis, additional third party validation and will require regulatory approvals from organizations like the FDA or EPA.  Regulated products not offered for sale or distribution prior to registration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or US FDA as required.

You are bound by the requirements and standards set forth in the Code of Business Conduct, as well as those set forth in this Code of Ethics and other applicable policies and procedures. In the event of any conflict between the Code of Business Conduct and this Code of Ethics, this Code of Ethics shall govern your behavior or any required approvals or waivers. Compliance with this Code of Ethics is a condition of your employment and any violations of this Code may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of your employment.
Waivers of this Code of Ethics may be made only by the board of directors of the Company or a committee of the board of directors comprised solely of independent directors. Any waivers of this Code of Ethics will be disclosed in accordance with applicable law, regulation or the requirements of any listing criteria of an exchange upon which the Company’s stock may be traded.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS
You are expected to comply with both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of our business and to report any suspected violations of all applicable laws, rules and regulations to either the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee. You will not be subject to retaliation because of a good faith report of a suspected violation of this Code of Ethics.
FRAUD, THEFT, BRIBERY AND SIMILAR CONDUCT
Any act that involves theft, fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation of any property, including that of the Company or any of its employees, suppliers or customers, is prohibited. Offering or accepting kickbacks or bribes are forbidden.

You may not serve as a director of a private company that is a supplier, customer, developer, or other business partner without first obtaining the approval of the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee. You also may not become a director of any public company, without first obtaining the approval of the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee.
You must not speculate or deal in materials, supplies, equipment or products that the Company buys or sells, or in property rights in which the Company may be interested.
Solicitation or acceptance by you or a member of your immediate family of any personal loan or guarantee from a customer, supplier or competitor.

Before acting in a manner that creates or appears to create a conflict of interest, you must make full disclosure to and obtain written approval of either the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE; REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS
If you have questions about this Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers, you should seek guidance from the Company’s legal counsel. If you know of or suspect a violation of applicable laws or regulations or this Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers, you must immediately report that information to either the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee. No one will be subject to retaliation because of a good faith report of a suspected violation.
NO RIGHTS CREATED
This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies and procedures that govern the Company’s Senior Officers in the conduct of the Company’s business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in any employee, customer, supplier, competitor, stockholder or any other person or entity.

BioLargo’s Clyra Medical Subsidiary on Track to File 510K with FDA for Novel Wound Care Products









Tamarack Advisers recently published an article focused on Clyra Medical Technologies' exciting presentation at the Peter Sheehan Wound Healing: Science & Industry Conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 



______________________________________________________



A year and a half ago, BioLargo,
Inc. (OTC: BLGO) announced that its Clyra Medical division secured financing to
advance its novel wound care products.  Steve Harrison,
President of Clyra Medical Technologies, then commented,
"We believe this financing will provide the capital needed to help Clyra
secure the regulatory approvals and launch what we believe will become a game
changer for the Advanced Wound Care industry. This is a fast-growing $8 to $10 billion market in which we
believe we will be able to offer better and more cost-effective solutions.”









Last month, Clyra Medical presented their
breakthrough products at the 15th annual Peter
Sheehan Wound Healing: Science & Industry Conference in Puerto Rico
that was attended by leading wound care clinicians and researchers. We had a chance to speak with Mr. Harrison who reported, “We
are highly encouraged by the overwhelming positive response from the clinical
wound care experts attending the conference.  The data from the FDA pre-submission
testing generated a great deal of enthusiasm among the leading clinicians and
researchers at the conference.  The required
pre-submission studies were conducted by Nelson
Labs,
an independent third party that is recognized as one of the leaders in
laboratory testing for FDA submissions.”







The presentation at the conference highlighted Clyra’s
advantages over existing wound care products: 



Clyra’s
hydrogel wound dressings and wound wash are highly effective and have no known
antimicrobial resistance


GLP
lab studies demonstrated sustained release and continued antimicrobial effectiveness against major organisms


Effective
against biofilm in laboratory controlled in vivo pig studies has shown effectiveness against mature biofilm, with better results than certain prescription antimicrobial solutions


Non
cytotoxic, non-sensitizing, and safe to human cells


Can
easily integrate Clyra technologies into existing products and new ones in the pipeline including regenerative tissue

  

Dr. Brock Liden, DPM, a wound care expert with an extensive
wound and limb salvage practice in Ohio presented the latest Clyra data to the
conference. He commented “When I was introduced to the Clyra technology I was
very interested to learn more. This is a complex that has been shown to impact
bacteria, and show sustained activity, yet be safe to cells and the wound
healing process. It may have clinical application to be used with cellular
tissue products, stem cells, and growth factors with no harm to the modality.
This is a significant breakthrough in the wound space. With further clinical
research we may even have a modality to impact established biofilms while doing
no harm to the host or the healing modalities being utilized.  As I learn more about Clyra’s technology, I
feel that it has the potential to have a significant impact in wound care as
well as potential in other areas of medicine”







On the flip side of their enthusiasm is that Clyra is
keenly aware of the stiff competition they will face in the wound care industry.  One established competitor offering a broad
line of wound care products is Smith & Nephew (NYSE: SNN).  Another is Osiris Therapeutics (NASDAQ: OSIR)
that offers regenerative medicine products for difficult to treat acute and
chronic wounds. 



Clyra has retained Emergo, a global firm specializing
in medical device regulatory consulting, to prepare its FDA filings, and
reports they are on track for filing in the very near future. With the
relatively short turnaround times for 510k submissions and the ongoing need for
better wound care products, it is possible that Clyra’s powerful, gentle and
long-lasting products may soon find themselves entering the rewarding stage of commercialization.

BioLargo Signs "National Purchasing Agreements" with Three Top Waste Industry Leaders






DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / June 27, 2017 / With population density and urbanization increasing around the world, the need for cost-effective industrial odor control has become an even greater priority, and the problem has largely gone unsolved by the traditional suppliers. Historically, the available solutions have not satisfied users because most products only mask foul odors with heavy fragrances rather than eliminating the odors. Leading waste handling companies have been struggling with industrial odors for decades, believing there was no cost-effective solution that truly works. The only true solution is a product that will mitigate waste-related odors by actually eliminating the odor-causing compounds, and doing so without breaking the bank. Until now, no such product has been on the market.

Recently, a new product is gaining traction among leading waste handling companies that may change the paradigm: CupriDyne® Clean Industrial Odor Eliminator, made by Odor-No-More, Inc., a subsidiary of BioLargo, Inc (BLGO). The company claims CupriDyne Clean "actually works" by eliminating odors, rather than masking them with fragrances. The product has been proven effective against the nasty odors created at all types of facilities that handle and process our trash - from the trash trucks that haul it, to the "transfer stations" that sort it, and at the landfills, composting centers, and recycling operations where it ends up. From a scientific perspective, CupriDyne Clean oxidizes odors such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, mercaptans, fatty acids, sulfur compounds, and VOC's (volatile organic compounds). It can even be delivered fragrance-free since it does not rely on any sort of masking strategy.

In the past few weeks BioLargo's subsidiary Odor-No-More has signed what are known as national purchasing or national supply agreements with three leading US waste handling companies; an interesting development given that they started selling the product a year ago and had since not reported major advances in sales. In an audio interview with SNNLive posted on the BioLargo blog a few weeks ago, BioLargo's president described the signing of these national agreements as breaking a "barrier to entry". According to their SEC filings the agreements do not guarantee any volume of sales, but they do put the company in the system of a large company as an approved vendor, allowing the local facilities to easily order product and get their account serviced, without having to secure payment or deal with new contracts. And, according to Calvert, the agreements allow them to approach a facility, explain the product has been reviewed and approved by corporate and been evaluated for safety, and that other company facilities are using it with success. Doing business with a larger company can have its challenges, and 'corporate approval' in agreements like these, would be a major gateway to sales in any industry. Calvert believes sales will continue to grow and have the potential to increase "significantly", calling 2017 a "breakthrough year".

In addition to the news about these national agreements, BioLargo has also recently reported additional scientific breakthroughs in its clean water treatment technology the AOS (Advanced Oxidation System), and that the company is on the verge of filing for an FDA approval for its advanced wound care products through its subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies. In any event, the market should respond positively as sales figures climb.

In BioLargo's April 25, 2017 trade release to industry at WasteExpo 2017, it disclosed the first national agreement, with Waste Connections, Inc., a multi-billion dollar company operating in 39 states. It announced a second national agreement in an interview on May 22, and then later identified the customer as Waste Industries USA, another top 10 U.S. company. At BioLargo's annual stockholder meeting on June 19th, they announced a third arrangement with another top 10 company but refused to disclose its identity. In a recent letter to BioLargo stockholders, Calvert reported, "We are now servicing 3 of the top 10 companies in the waste handling industry," and confirmed that sales are growing.




While the waste handling industry is certainly a prolific consumer of industrial odor control products, the need for such products extends into other large industries such as wastewater treatment, livestock and poultry production, food processing, composting and more. In fact, across these industries there are over one million industrial facilities with serious and chronic odor control challenges.

U.S. Industries that generate industrial odors

Approximate # U.S. Operations
Solid waste facilities - 15,740
Waste to energy plants - 300
Cattle and calf operations - 915,000
Poultry farms - 233,770
Meat & poultry slaughtering plants - 6,278
Hog farms - 12,200
Publicly operated wastewater plants - 14,780


Total U.S. Industrial Facilities - 1,198,068

Regardless of how large the market need is, the big question is: how much of this large market can be won by a "disruptive" new product, categorically superior to competitors? BioLargo has reported in its market analyses that the facilities they target could use anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000 per month in odor control products, although weather and temperature may have an impact on the need to control odor at any one facility. Hypothetically, if CupriDyne Clean captured 10% of the market in the solid waste facilities business alone, at a gross revenue per month of $2,000 that would equate to approximately $36 million in annual sales. There's no way to know what market share they will eventually capture. Sales should be ramping up as a result of breaking through the barriers and everyone, including management, will be anxious to see the results come in. The three recent national agreements are certainly a good sign for BioLargo's commercial future.

There appear to be a few big competitors in the industrial odor control market like ProSweet by General Electric (GE), and Versene by Dow Chemical (DOW) but apparently none perform like CupriDyne® Clean.

With all the excitement surrounding these recent developments, Calvert was quick to point out in a recent meeting at LD Micro that "Odor-No-More's continued success in this market will require careful attention to product support and customer service." Calvert added, "We love our customers, we offer exceptional service and, our CupriDyne Clean Industrial Odor Eliminator actually works."

Developing Clean Water, Clean Air, and Advanced Wound Care Technologies, BioLargo, Inc. Focuses on Products that Improve Quality of Life









CEO/CFO Magazine Interview

Dennis P. Calvert

President, Chief Executive Officer

and Chairman of the Board



BioLargo, Inc. 

(OTCQB: BLGO)

www.biolargo.com



Interview conducted by:

Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published – June 26, 2017



CEOCFO: Mr. Calvert, the BioLargo tagline is “We Make Life Better.” Would you tell us how you do that?

Mr. Calvert: The company has been inventing technologies and products for about ten years. Our primary focus is in the areas of clean water, clean air, and advanced healthcare. Our technologies were all designed and developed with the singular goal to improve quality of life in some way in their respective field and we believe they are all technical breakthroughs that can improve quality of life in many areas and for many people.



CEOCFO: How do you decide what to bring into the fold?

Mr. Calvert: We work hard to focus on important technical advances that are purposeful and valuable to make life better. We only invest in products that have the potential to become known as the #1 technical performer in their respective markets. However, innovation does involve risk. In order to pick winning opportunities, the first thing we do is conduct substantial market research to look for areas or challenges that are not well-served by existing products or technologies. Secondly, we look for margins – a place where innovation can be awarded so that as you find market traction, there are sufficient margins to pull and drive the risk and cost of innovation, because the R&D budget and time commitment to develop these products is very significant. Additionally, we are also coming into crowded marketplaces typically dominated by very large companies, so we look for the area in which we can find access to the market, whether by relationship or distribution channel or through a partnership. Our motto for our development cycle is that we invent, we prove, and we partner. At the end of the day, most of the market adoption that we enjoy is through partnerships with companies and people that already serve well-established marketplaces.



CEOCFO: Would you tell us about the products that you have available now?

Mr. Calvert: Our advanced water treatment technology is called AOS (Advanced Oxidation System), and the research and development work for this product has now received approximately thirty-five grants. It is in the Alpha prototype stage and heading into Beta stage, and was developed in conjunction with a number of industry leaders and researchers at the University of Alberta. The AOS represents a technical leap forward in the way we can treat contaminated water, and its primary value proposition is that it performs superior disinfection and decontamination, with an emphasis on soluble organics. The remarkable characteristic that gets everyone’s attention is its highly efficient performance and incredibly low electricity consumption, which translates to low cost. Its technical efficacy is now proven, and we are now heading into the scale-up and engineering effort for large scale commercial uses.



CEOCFO: How does AOS work?

Mr. Calvert: The discovery is that we can take low levels of electrical energy and combine it with an oxidant (iodine) at a low dose in a special carbon bed, resulting in highly efficient water disinfection/decontamination. Because of the way our system is configured, we actually generate what is called “super-oxides”, which are incredibly high-energy oxidative molecules, across the length of a filter apparatus made of carbon materials. The key to our discovery is that we can generate super-oxides while requiring incredibly low electrical energy levels, and the oxidation potential we generate is an order of magnitude higher than was previously known possible with electrochemical systems. 



CEOCFO: How is this used?

Mr. Calvert: The water industry is a behemoth at approximately $850 billion annually. In principle, our technology could have application in just about every sector of the water industry. Our focus at the moment is on picking the market where we believe we can win and where there are margins that sufficiently award innovation, and where we have relationships and access to the marketplace. We are focused right now in the food and beverage sector with an emphasis on processing wastewater. In this application, it’s an incredibly difficult, technical, and costly challenge to clean up contaminated wastewater, and the food and beverage industry is facing increasing pressure to deal with their waste streams. Existing water treatment platforms are not serving this market need sufficiently, which spurred us to focus our efforts in this area. We have a number of relationships in this industry; in fact our research center is located at Agri-Food Discovery Place at the University of Alberta. As a result of those key relationships, we have access to expertise, potential customers, collaborators and leading researchers. While this area is our first focus, we believe eventually that our technology will find its way into just about every segment of the water market. 



CEOCFO: What else is going on at BioLargo?

Mr. Calvert: We have two other key product lines: one is our industrial odor control product, CupriDyne Clean, which is now finding rapid adoption in the waste handling and wastewater treatment industries. We recently signed three national contracts with leading companies that serve the waste industry and we believe we are going to get all the major industry leaders. In this application, we are delivering liquid chemistry to solve odor control challenges through misting systems, and also water delivery systems like water trucks and spray apparatuses. CupriDyne Clean is being used to oxidize odorous compounds that are the natural byproduct of waste, but that cause the waste handling industry substantial grief. These compounds include ammonia and H2S, and other sulphur compounds, as well as mercaptans and fatty acids. Waste handling and wastewater treatment facilities are a primary target and we have chosen to target national corporate accounts. We have secured three national contracts in the last six weeks. The product is effective, safe, easy to use and affordable. We believe we are going to land contracts with all of the industry leaders.



CEOCFO: Why is now the time?

Mr. Calvert: CupriDyne Clean was first launched in May of 2016, and the science was first developed and refined for consumer product applications. Our consumer products won all sorts of praise and acclaim, including four “product of the year awards” in the pet and companion animal industry, but those consumer products have not yet found a meaningful channel for distribution. About a year and a half ago, as a result of my relationship as board member of SustainOC.org, an industry trade group based in Southern California, we had a chance to meet one of the regional vice presidents at one of the largest waste handling companies in the world. He urged us to consider taking the technology into a development cycle to serve the national waste handling industry, which is commonly referred to as industrial odor control. That led to trials, which were exceptional, and we were even congratulated as having a “revolutionary” technological advance for the waste handling industry – this was a little over a year ago. Since then we have invested in becoming familiar with and learning that industry, working with top management, and developing both top-down and bottom-up marketing strategies. CupriDyne has been serving the industrial odor control industry in the field for about a year now, and we just have recently broken through a significant barrier to entry by securing those national accounts, and now we’re selling product to many of the largest companies in the waste handling industry.



CEOCFO: Do you have a third area of focus?

Mr. Calvert: One of our technologies is organized in a subsidiary named Clyra Medical Technologies, and it is focused on developing and commercializing a series of advanced wound care products. In that company, we recently brought in a strategic investor who invested about $1 million over the past year. We then invested to recruit the best talent possible –  leaders from the industry and well-entrenched specialists – to develop a series of advanced wound care products. As a result of all that work, we believe we will be making FDA applications under 510(k) in the next few weeks for the first of these products. We believe these advanced wound care products will be highly disruptive for a very large, important and urgent need in the advanced wound care field. 



CEOCFO: Why has it been so hard to find a way to treat chronic wounds?

Mr. Calvert: Chronic infected wounds are often the result of suppressed immune systems, and typically occur with senior citizens who commonly suffer from poor circulation and/or diabetes. The nature of these wounds makes them extremely difficult to manage. When it comes to treating and healing those wounds, the industry is continually seeking new and improved technical solutions. Silver compounds historically had the largest market share, however, these compounds are coming under increased scrutiny for their potential to cause microbial resistance and, as one might imagine, they can be very expensive. There are a number of iodine-based products that have done well, but the traditional iodine products on the market are often considered cytotoxic, and they often cause staining and are difficult to work with. They are quite effective as disinfectants, but they also had a potential to cause tissue damage and in some cases inhibit scar formation. Physicians and patients have therefore been forced to accept side effects for the sake of efficacy. These dynamics and the obvious need for improvement create a market gap for an antimicrobial strategy with no known acquired resistance that is gentle and at the same time helps promote rapid healing. This is where our Clyra Medical Technologies will shine. Our products are proven effective in the disinfection of a broad array of pathogens and include ingredients that are naturally accepted by the body and have well-established metabolic pathways. We have successfully passed the required Cytotox and sensitivity testing. We also believe some of our ingredients will be highly effective in helping the body form scar tissue. We also have evidence to support their potential role to help manage biofilms. The combination of all these features gives our subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies a significant competitive edge in a highly competitive and highly technical market. There is a market gap, and we intend to fill that gap with these products.



CEOCFO: What are the challenges as CEO with so much happening at one time?

Mr. Calvert: In each of these product lines we have actually formed companies and recruited specialists to guide us as we fully develop these technical products and platforms. We invent, prove and partner. In all of these situations we believe the ultimate outcome will be for these products to find their way into partnerships by licensing and joint venturing. We are exceptionally good at the inventing and proving side. However, it would be difficult to manage the full execution of all of these products to a full-scale commercial level. For example, if we look at our wound care technology, it presents itself into a perfect spinoff into its own company, and we intend to pursue that when it is ready. In other situations, like our industrial odor control product, we are taking the product directly to market through our wholly owned subsidiary Odor-No-More. The water technology is so big that we believe multiple partnerships will present themselves across the various industry segments. 



CEOCFO: What has changed in your approach over time?

Mr. Calvert: Over time we have become increasingly more discerning and selective as to where we choose to invest our time, energy and money. We seek opportunities where we can succeed and where there is a previously unidentified solution to a problem. Over time we have become highly skilled at that. As a result of the refinements and technical advances, we are finding success. We know that proper capitalization and finding the right talent are ever so critical. We are becoming increasingly skilled at making sure that both of those key pieces of the puzzle are in place to execute a successful commercial strategy. Relative to the opportunities in the general marketplace, we see problems associated with microbial control, increasing urbanization, consolidation of industry, and so on. If you think of it at the highest level, and look at the nature of air and water and healthcare, they all face problems that are a direct result of concentration and vacuums – this idea that with highly industrialized waste streams, highly concentrated urban density, we often overload the system with microbial threats and the problems require technological innovation to overcome them efficiently and cost effectively.



CEOCFO: Has the investment community been paying attention?

Mr. Calvert: We have a significant group of investors that have supported our business. Our total invested capital is about $20 million since we began this journey in 2007. We are beginning to capture early-stage institutional investor’s attention and we are anxious to take the company into a national market when ready. We also are now at the point where we are finding commercial traction in very large markets with substantial upside. That is new and certainly increases our exposure. Our company has an important piece of the puzzle to help make life better in a few of the most critical markets known, water, air and healthcare. The marketplace has not fully recognized that yet, but it will!



CEOCFO: What might be missed about Biolargo at first look?

Mr. Calvert: As a science and technology-based company, it is difficult for the average onlooker to fully appreciate the significance of our technical advances. It takes discernment and digging in. When people dig deep they tend to be  quite astonished. The innovation behind BioLargo is the culmination of our founder and Chief Science Officer Ken Code’s life’s work. I can’t imagine a more meaningful legacy. Everything that we do represents a significant technical leap forward and that is not necessarily easy to identify for the average investor. As a result, unfortunately, many investors might wait for commercial success. Those who recognize the significance of our technical advances often become our investors. As hard as it might be to pick a winner before commercial success is fully realized, we know that BioLargo’s sustainable technologies will become recognized around the world to help make life better as we deliver clean water, clean air and advanced healthcare as the low cost and high impact solution provider.



Of course, we remind everyone to study our Annual Report and Quarterly Report’s at www.sec.gov for complete disclosure the various risk factors and financial condition of the company as they evaluate our business.

President and CEO’s report of BioLargo 2017 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting








Dear BioLargo Stockholders,



We had a great meeting yesterday (June 19th)
at our corporate offices in Westminster California. If you were unable to
attend, we missed you and we encourage you to attend in the future. Of course,
we also encourage you to reach out to us anytime to discuss our status and
progress. It was so good to reconnect
with old friends and share our team’s enthusiasm for BioLargo and our mission
to make life better.  



The business of the meeting was successfully
accomplished. All recommendations presented to the stockholders were approved. During
a discussion of business progress, we provided insights about a series of important
commercial milestones, and helped explain why we believe the future remains so
bright for BioLargo. Here are a few highlights: 

 Jack B. “Jay” Strommen has
officially joined our Board of Directors . He plays a critical role with
BioLargo as an investor, partner, and financier of our subsidiary Clyra Medical
Technologies. He is a winner and a strong addition to our team, and on behalf
of the company we thank him for his hard work. 
We want to take a moment to
thank Gary Cox for his years of dedicated service as a Board Member at BioLargo
that ended yesterday. We look forward to pursuing new business relationships together
in the future. 
We reviewed our presentation
given at the 7th Annual LD Micro Invitational conference on June 6,
2017 (linked here),
which provided a comprehensive overview of our progress, our milestones, and
our near term and long term goals. 
We shared the news (linked here) about our increasing
sales of our CupriDyne Clean Industrial Odor Control products,  nd that we expect
these sales to continue to increase due to the very recent execution of “National
Purchasing Agreements” with two of the top 10 waste handling companies in the industry,
as previously announced, providing us vendor status that allows us to sell to
the local facilities of these large companies. We also shared new information
that we have just entered into a similar contractual relationship with another top
industry member. We are now servicing three of the top 10 companies in the waste
handling industry. These agreements demonstrate that we are breaking through the
significant barriers-to-entry for this market, and are a testimony to the
now-recognized superior quality of our products, as well as the continuing
commitment of the team at our subsidiary Odor-No-More, Inc. to support these
very important customers. As our satisfied customers say, “Finally, an
industrial odor control product that actually works”. Stay tuned for more
information as we advance sales! 
We enjoyed an update from Mr.
Steve Harrison, President of our subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies, on his
plan to file a 510(k) application with the FDA very soon. With the support of a
$1 million investment from the Strommen family made over the past year, we were
able to develop an advanced wound care product for topical use on chronic
infected wounds, and a dental product that can help patients avoid post-surgical
infections. We believe these two products set the stage to build a portfolio of
products to serve these important markets. Mr. Harrison reported that the first
public presentation about our products will be made later this week at the Annual Wound Healing: Science and Industry Conference
(WoundHSI), sponsored by the Peter Sheehan Diabetes Care Foundation (http://www.woundhsi.org). Our products will be highlighted in a presentation by a
leading professional in the field, Dr. Brock A. Liden, DPM, titled Anti-Infective and Biofilm Therapy. 
We updated the attendees on the advancing discussions with
potential engineering scale-up partners, potential commercial partners, and
public funding sources for our AOS clean water technology. As you may recall,
we have proven the science behind the AOS, and have developed its water
disinfection and decontamination thoroughly in the lab. We are now heading from
the “Alpha” prototype to a “Beta” prototype, and subsequently to commercialization.
The science of this technology is advancing and gaining international acclaim,
and we look forward to sharing more details as we prepare for our 3rd
annual technical symposium in August. 


Before I close, I want to take a moment to
remember one our original team members, Mr. Jeffrey Wallace, who recently
passed away. Jeff was critical part of the early days of organizing BioLargo
into what it has become today. He was a GREAT man that invested his life
serving others. As a man of integrity, he mentored more than 50 Eagle Scouts in
the Boy Scouts of America program and he left a lasting mark in this world for
all things good and right. We will miss Jeff and pray for his family in their
loss. Amen.



2017 is the break-through year for BioLargo
and we are thankful for your continued support. 




Stay tuned as we march forward in our
mission to make life better!

BioLargo's Odor-No-More to Revolutionize Waste Handling Industry with Industrial Odor Control Product – CupriDyne® Clean





“FINALLY AN INDUSTRIAL ODOR CONTROL PRODUCT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS”

By: Tamarack Advisers

For the original article, by Tamarack Advisers, go here.

Anyone who’s taken the trash out to the garbage cans knows that trash smells. And, we’re thankful when the trash truck comes by once a week to collect it. The waste handling industry, which exceeds $75 Billion annually in the U.S. makes our smelly trash and sewage “go away” without us giving it a second thought. While our trash and sewage seems to magically disappear from our lives, we know it has to end up somewhere. This “somewhere” is usually a landfill or wastewater treatment plant and more recently with new laws and regulations, a composting or recycling facility. On the way there, our trash passes through a “transfer station”, probably not far from where you live. These facilities – transfer stations, landfills, wastewater treatment plants and the like - harbor some of the more putrescent odors on the planet. In fact, with increasing urbanization and population growth, many US neighborhoods are close enough to these facilities to be impacted by these strong, far-reaching odors, resulting in frequent complaints, regulatory violations, and litigation.  According to Waste360, the leading information, event, commerce and education provider to the solid waste, recycling, organics industries, “a survey reveals that odors continue to trouble the solid waste industry” and “odor has even been referred to as the Achilles heel of composting.”



from: https://www.pexels.com/search/landfill/

Foul odors are a natural result of decomposing organic material that is a major constituent in trash and sewage. Common problematic odor-causing compounds found in such material include hydrogen sulfide (H2S), that smells like rotten eggs, ammonia, (NH3), that smells like a cat litter box, fatty acids, mercaptans, and other malodors including volatile organic compounds.

To combat regulatory violations and neighbor lawsuits, the waste handling industry has historically relied on odor control products that use strong fragrances (e.g., citrus or cherry) to try to overpower unpleasant odors. Some companies have installed expensive covers and enclosures to mitigate the negative impact of odors on their neighbors. But, while solutions like these have historically been considered the “best available,” these old strategies do not go to the root of the problem – the odor-causing compounds themselves – and therefore tend to fail. While some enzyme-based solutions do eliminate some odor-causing compounds, they often have a limited range of activity, and can take a while to work.

The industry has operated so long without a suitable technical solution that they are understandably skeptical when a new product emerges with claims that it actually dismantles and eliminates the odor causing elements. However, one newcomer to the industry is now gaining traction and awareness of its odor-elimination claims…

CupriDyne Clean Finding Welcome Market

Word is spreading in the waste services industry that BioLargo’s CupriDyne Clean is the only industrial odor control product that actually eliminates foul odors by oxidizing the compounds that cause them while remaining safe, easy to use, and affordable. Just a few weeks ago, BioLargo, Inc. (OTCQB: BLGO) announced that its subsidiary Odor-No-More had signed a “National Purchasing Agreement” (NPA) with one of the largest solid waste and recycling companies in North America to be able to provide them with their revolutionary odor control product CupriDyne Clean. Additional details were highlighted in a trade press release by Waste360. Just weeks later, the company reported that it had signed its second top 10 waste industry company to an NPA. Management recently reported in an interview by Uptick Newswire that more contracts with leading companies are in the works and sales had started to grow.



In a special Waste360 report, Joseph Provenzano, President of BioLargo’s Odor-No-More division explained, “CupriDyne Clean oxidizes all volatile organic compounds (VOCs), amines, sulfur compounds, fatty acids, and mercaptans prevalent at sites that process organics. Our products are broad spectrum and work indiscriminately on all organically derived odors. They eliminate odors rather than cover them. Most other industry products use fragrance to mask odors, often exacerbating the problem. Our products are not masking agents. Rather, this green technology breaks down odorous compounds through oxidation. Odor reduction is immediate and it is safe.”

The Waste360 special report adds, “Odor-No-More’s patented product line features CupriDyne Clean, an odor control solution tailored to integrate within a site’s operations, whether it is a landfill, composting facility, materials recovery facility (MRF), transfer station, or wastewater treatment plant. Scientifically-proven and eco-friendly, CupriDyne Clean can be dispensed through misting systems, portable sprayers and/or water trucks to accommodate current infrastructure, each available in varied sizes.”

In the article, “BioLargo Subsidiary Odor-No-More Finds Welcome Market: Executes National Purchasing Agreement with Leading Waste and Recycling Service Company”  Dennis P. Calvert, president and CEO of BioLargo commented, "Our claim that CupriDyne Clean is the top performing, safe and sustainable odor control product in the waste industry today continues to be supported by our performance trials and sales with leading waste handing companies.  Our start in this industry was a pretty humble beginning. We made a key contact through SustainOC, a regional trade association in Southern California where we serve on the board with industry business leaders. A regional executive from one of the biggest companies in the world requested that we develop a product for this industry and later witnessed our first onsite trail to validate its performance.  Having witnessed the results, he turned to our team, offered a handshake and commented, ‘Congratulations, you are going to revolutionize the waste-handling industry.’  To offer some temper to our enthusiasm, as great as that prediction sounds, we then had to set about the task building out the product line, developing infrastructure, performance data, a marketing campaign and delivery processes to support this enormous and demanding industry. That work continues. Having broken through a major barrier to entry, our national purchasing agreements designate us as an approved vendor and allows us to initiate sales and service efforts to all of their operations without any formal guarantee of purchase volumes. We have much work to do to support this and every other opportunity like this, as we serve our important and valuable customers. Stay tuned to watch us build our business."

CupriDyne will compete with a large number of vendors providing strong fragrance masking solutions and traditional enzyme-based industrial odor control products offered by GE (NYSE: GE) and DOW Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW). GE offers ProSweet Odor Solutions and DOW offers Versene.

Unmanageable odors can be a public relations nightmare for waste industry operators. In an industry that did not believe there was a solution that can actually eliminate troublesome systemic odors, finding an industrial odor control product that actually works sounds… ‘revolutionary’.

BioLargo is certainly a company to watch. It is a science and technology company with multiple irons in the fire, with its focus on clean air, clean water and advanced wound care. With this news, it seems BioLargo found a welcome market for its industrial odor control product CupriDyne Clean. (www.cupridyne.com)

	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published � June 26, 2017

 


CEOCFO:
Mr. Calvert, the BioLargo tagline is �We Make Life Better.� Would you 
	tell us how you do that?


Mr. Calvert: 
The company 
	has been inventing technologies and products for about ten years. Our 
	primary focus is in the areas of clean water, clean air, and advanced 
	healthcare. Our technologies were all designed and developed with the 
	singular goal to improve quality of life in some way in their respective 
	field and we believe they are all technical breakthroughs that can improve 
	quality of life in many areas and for many people.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you decide what to bring into the fold?


Mr. Calvert: 
	We work hard to focus on important technical advances that are purposeful 
	and valuable to make life better. We only invest in products that have the 
	potential to become known as the #1 technical performer in their respective 
	markets. However, innovation does involve risk. In order to pick winning 
	opportunities, the first thing we do is conduct substantial market research 
	to look for areas or challenges that are not well-served by existing 
	products or technologies. Secondly, we look for margins � a place where 
	innovation can be awarded so that as you find market traction, there are 
	sufficient margins to pull and drive the risk and cost of innovation, 
	because the R&D budget and time commitment to develop these products is very 
	significant. Additionally, we are also coming into crowded marketplaces 
	typically dominated by very large companies, so we look for the area in 
	which we can find access to the market, whether by relationship or 
	distribution channel or through a partnership. Our motto for our development 
	cycle is that we invent, we prove, and we partner. At the end of the day, 
	most of the market adoption that we enjoy is through partnerships with 
	companies and people that already serve well-established marketplaces.
	

 


CEOCFO: 
	Would you tell us about the products that you have available now?


Mr. Calvert: 
	Our advanced water treatment technology is called AOS (Advanced Oxidation 
	System), and the research and development work for this product has now 
	received approximately thirty-five grants. It is in the Alpha prototype 
	stage and heading into Beta stage, and was developed in conjunction with a 
	number of industry leaders and researchers at the University of Alberta. The 
	AOS represents a technical leap forward in the way we can treat contaminated 
	water, and its primary value proposition is that it performs superior 
	disinfection and decontamination, with an emphasis on soluble organics. The 
	remarkable characteristic that gets everyone�s attention is its highly 
	efficient performance and incredibly low electricity consumption, which 
	translates to low cost. Its technical efficacy is now proven, and we are now 
	heading into the scale-up and engineering effort for large scale commercial 
	uses.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How does AOS work?


Mr. Calvert: 
	The discovery is that we can take low levels of electrical energy and 
	combine it with an oxidant (iodine) at a low dose in a special carbon bed, 
	resulting in highly efficient water disinfection/decontamination. Because of 
	the way our system is configured, we actually generate what is called 
	�super-oxides�, which are incredibly high-energy oxidative molecules, across 
	the length of a filter apparatus made of carbon materials. The key to our 
	discovery is that we can generate super-oxides while requiring incredibly 
	low electrical energy levels, and the oxidation potential we generate is an 
	order of magnitude higher than was previously known possible with 
	electrochemical systems. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	How is this used?


Mr. Calvert: 
	The water industry is a behemoth at approximately $850 billion annually. In 
	principle, our technology could have application in just about every sector 
	of the water industry. Our focus at the moment is on picking the market 
	where we believe we can win and where there are margins that sufficiently 
	award innovation, and where we have relationships and access to the 
	marketplace. We are focused right now in the food and beverage sector with 
	an emphasis on processing wastewater. In this application, it�s an 
	incredibly difficult, technical, and costly challenge to clean up 
	contaminated wastewater, and the food and beverage industry is facing 
	increasing pressure to deal with their waste streams. Existing water 
	treatment platforms are not serving this market need sufficiently, which 
	spurred us to focus our efforts in this area. We have a number of 
	relationships in this industry; in fact our research center is located at 
	Agri-Food Discovery Place at the University of Alberta. As a result of those 
	key relationships, we have access to expertise, potential customers, 
	collaborators and leading researchers. While this area is our first focus, 
	we believe eventually that our technology will find its way into just about 
	every segment of the water market. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What else is going on at BioLargo?


Mr. Calvert: 
	We have two other key product lines: one is our industrial odor control 
	product, CupriDyne Clean, which is now finding rapid adoption in the waste 
	handling and wastewater treatment industries. We recently signed three 
	national contracts with leading companies that serve the waste industry and 
	we believe we are going to get all the major industry leaders. In this 
	application, we are delivering liquid chemistry to solve odor control 
	challenges through misting systems, and also water delivery systems like 
	water trucks and spray apparatuses. CupriDyne Clean is being used to oxidize 
	odorous compounds that are the natural byproduct of waste, but that cause 
	the waste handling industry substantial grief. These compounds include 
	ammonia and H2S, and other sulphur compounds, as well as 
	mercaptans and fatty acids. Waste handling and wastewater treatment 
	facilities are a primary target and we have chosen to target national 
	corporate accounts. We have secured three national contracts in the last six 
	weeks. The product is effective, safe, easy to use and affordable. We 
	believe we are going to land contracts with all of the industry leaders.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why is now the time?


Mr. Calvert: 
	CupriDyne Clean was first launched in May of 2016, and the science was first 
	developed and refined for consumer product applications. Our consumer 
	products won all sorts of praise and acclaim, including four �product of the 
	year awards� in the pet and companion animal industry, but those consumer 
	products have not yet found a meaningful channel for distribution. About a 
	year and a half ago, as a result of my relationship as board member of 
	SustainOC.org, an industry trade group based in Southern California, we had 
	a chance to meet one of the regional vice presidents at one of the largest 
	waste handling companies in the world. He urged us to consider taking the 
	technology into a development cycle to serve the national waste handling 
	industry, which is commonly referred to as industrial odor control. That led 
	to trials, which were exceptional, and we were even congratulated as having 
	a �revolutionary� technological advance for the waste handling industry � 
	this was a little over a year ago. Since then we have invested in becoming 
	familiar with and learning that industry, working with top management, and 
	developing both top-down and bottom-up marketing strategies. CupriDyne has 
	been serving the industrial odor control industry in the field for about a 
	year now, and we just have recently broken through a significant barrier to 
	entry by securing those national accounts, and now we�re selling product to 
	many of the largest companies in the waste handling industry.

 


CEOCFO: Do 
	you have a third area of focus?


Mr. Calvert: 
	One of our technologies is organized in a subsidiary named Clyra Medical 
	Technologies, and it is focused on developing and commercializing a series 
	of advanced wound care products. In that company, we recently brought in a 
	strategic investor who invested about $1 million over the past year. We then 
	invested to recruit the best talent possible �  leaders from the industry 
	and well-entrenched specialists � to develop a series of advanced wound care 
	products. As a result of all that work, we believe we will be making FDA 
	applications under 510(k) in the next few weeks for the first of these 
	products. We believe these advanced wound care products will be highly 
	disruptive for a very large, important and urgent need in the advanced wound 
	care field. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why has it been so hard to find a way to treat chronic wounds?


Mr. Calvert: 
	Chronic infected wounds are often the result of suppressed immune systems, 
	and typically occur with senior citizens who commonly suffer from poor 
	circulation and/or diabetes. The nature of these wounds makes them simply 
	extremely difficult to manage. When it comes to treating and healing those 
	wounds, the industry is continually seeking new and improved technical 
	solutions. Silver compounds historically had the largest market share, 
	however, these compounds are coming under increased scrutiny for their 
	potential to cause microbial resistance and, as one might imagine, they can 
	be very expensive. There are a number of iodine-based products that have 
	done well, but the traditional iodine products on the market are often 
	considered cytotoxic, and they often cause staining and are difficult to 
	work with. They are quite effective as disinfectants, but they also had a 
	potential to cause tissue damage and in some cases inhibit scar formation. 
	Physicians and patients have therefore been forced to accept side effects 
	for the sake of efficacy. These dynamics and the obvious need for 
	improvement create a market gap for an antimicrobial strategy with no known 
	acquired resistance that is gentle and at the same time helps promote rapid 
	healing. This is where our Clyra Medical Technologies will shine. Our 
	products are proven effective in the disinfection of a broad array of 
	pathogens and include ingredients that are naturally accepted by the body 
	and have well-established metabolic pathways. We have successfully passed 
	the required Cytotox and sensitivity testing. We also believe some of our 
	ingredients will be highly effective in helping the body form scar tissue. 
	We also have evidence to support their potential role to help manage 
	biofilms. The combination of all these features gives our subsidiary Clyra 
	Medical Technologies a significant competitive edge in a highly competitive 
	and highly technical market. There is a market gap, and we intend to fill 
	that gap with these products.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What are the challenges as CEO with so much happening at one time?


Mr. Calvert: 
	In each of these product lines we have actually formed companies and 
	recruited specialists to guide us as we fully develop these technical 
	products and platforms. We invent, prove and partner. In all of these 
	situations we believe the ultimate outcome will be for these products to 
	find their way into partnerships by licensing and joint venturing. We are 
	exceptionally good at the inventing and proving side. However, it would be 
	difficult to manage the full execution of all of these products to a 
	full-scale commercial level. For example, if we look at our wound care 
	technology, it presents itself into a perfect spinoff into its own company, 
	and we intend to pursue that when it is ready. In other situations, like our 
	industrial odor control product, we are taking the product directly to 
	market through our wholly owned subsidiary Odor-No-More. The water 
	technology is so big that we believe multiple partnerships will present 
	themselves across the various industry segments. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What has changed in your approach over time?


Mr. Calvert: 
	Over time we have become increasingly more discerning and selective as to 
	where we choose to invest our time, energy and money. We seek opportunities 
	where we can succeed and where there is a previously unidentified solution 
	to a problem. Over time we have become highly skilled at that. As a result 
	of the refinements and technical advances, we are finding success. We know 
	that proper capitalization and finding the right talent are ever so 
	critical. We are becoming increasingly skilled at making sure that both of 
	those key pieces of the puzzle are in place to execute a successful 
	commercial strategy. Relative to the opportunities in the general 
	marketplace, we see problems associated with microbial control, increasing 
	urbanization, consolidation of industry, and so on. If you think of it at 
	the highest level, and look at the nature of air and water and healthcare, 
	they all face problems that are a direct result of concentration and vacuums 
	� this idea that with highly industrialized waste streams, highly 
	concentrated urban density, we often overload the system with microbial 
	threats and the problems require technological innovation to overcome them 
	efficiently and cost effectively.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Has the investment community been paying attention?


Mr. Calvert: 
	We have a significant group of investors that have supported our business. 
	Our total invested capital is about $20 million since we began this journey 
	in 2007. We are beginning to capture early-stage institutional investor�s 
	attention and we are anxious to take the company into a national market when 
	ready. We also are now at the point where we are finding commercial traction 
	in very large markets with substantial upside. That is new and certainly 
	increases our exposure. Our company has an important piece of the puzzle to 
	help make life better in a few of the most critical markets known, water, 
	air and healthcare. The marketplace has not fully recognized that yet, but 
	it will!

 


CEOCFO: 
	What might be missed about Biolargo at first look?


Mr. Calvert: 
	As a science and technology-based company, it is difficult for the average 
	onlooker to fully appreciate the significance of our technical advances. It 
	takes discernment and digging in. When people dig deep they tend to be 
	 quite astonished. The innovation behind BioLargo is the culmination of our 
	founder and Chief Science Officer Ken Code�s life�s work. I can�t imagine a 
	more meaningful legacy. Everything that we do represents a significant 
	technical leap forward and that is not necessarily easy to identify for the 
	average investor. As a result, unfortunately, many investors might wait for 
	commercial success. Those who recognize the significance of our technical 
	advances often become our investors. As hard as it might be to pick a winner 
	before commercial success is fully realized, we know that BioLargo�s 
	sustainable technologies will become recognized around the world to help 
	make life better as we deliver clean water, clean air and advanced 
	healthcare as the low cost and high impact solution provider.


	 


	Of course, we remind everyone to study our Annual Report and Quarterly 
	Report�s at 


	www.sec.gov 
	for complete disclosure the various risk factors and financial condition of 
	the company as they evaluate our business.

	to help make life better as we deliver clean water, clean air and advanced 
	healthcare as the low cost and high impact solution provider.�- Dennis P.

                        BioLargo Story
                    


The Beginning
Kenneth Reay Code, the ‘Inventor’, entrusted with the BioLargo Technology, began this journey of ours over 10 years ago when his father had a severe stroke and was left severely impaired, bed ridden or wheel chair confined and in need of long-term convalescent care. Out of concern for his father’s great risk of secondary infection, Ken set out to find a way to extend his father’s life expectancy and improve his quality of life by reducing his risk of contracting disease and by reducing compounding risks of secondary infections that are so common in long-term care facilities.
Through his scientific trials of blending low dose inorganic chemical compounds and absorbent materials he made what may just be called a “genuine discovery”.
When the BioLargo Technology is incorporated into products, many of which are already widely known and in use, those products become an effective tool in stopping the transmission of life threatening disease.





                        Our Purpose
                    


We help solve some of the world’s most important problems that threaten our water, air, food, agriculture, healthcare and energy by delivering products and services that feature our BioLargo Technology. Our innovative technologies deliver Nature’s Best Solution, Free Iodine, an essential nutrient, oxidizing agent, catalyst and all natural broad spectrum disinfectant with no known microbial resistance, to help keep people safe from disease and infection and to help keep our water, earth, and air clean, safe, and healthy. Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people world-wide, to protect the environment, and to produce positive economic results for our customers, partners, and shareholders.





                        Mission Statement
                    


Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people worldwide.
