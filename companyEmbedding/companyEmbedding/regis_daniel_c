From 1996 to 1999, he was President of Kirlan Venture Capital, Inc., where he managed similarly focused technology funds. During that time, he was also a director or chairman of several pre-public companies. Prior to 1996, Mr. Regis spent more than 30 years with Price Waterhouse LLP, including serving as Managing Partner of the Seattle office and previously of the Northwest and Portland, Oregon offices. From 2003 to 2015, Mr. Regis served as a member of the board of directors of Columbia Banking Systems, Inc., was a member of its audit committee and chaired its Risk Management Committee from 2010 to 2015. In 2004, Mr. Regis was a member of the audit committee of Art Technology Group, Inc. and also joined their board and became Chairman of the board of directors in 2005, where he served in this role until January 2011 when Art Technology Group merged with Oracle Corporation. From 2003 to 2004, Mr. Regis was a member of the board of directors of Primus Knowledge Solutions, Inc. until its merger with Art Technology Group, Inc. in 2004 and chaired its audit committee. He received a B.S. from Seattle University. We believe Mr. Regis' qualifications to sit on our Board of Directors include his over three decades of experience in finance and accounting, including as a managing partner at a national accounting firm, as well as his experience evaluating and directing technology companies.
