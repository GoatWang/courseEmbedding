	Whole-House Framing Decay & Termite Protection

	Termite attack on wooden structures in the United States leads to billions of dollars in damages each year. In recent years, the introduction of the Formosan termite into Hawaii and the southern US has been well documented, and has lead to a significant increase in the degree and rate of termite damage caused to homes and commercial structures.

	For interior applications such as wood-frame construction and interior sheathing applications, TimberSaver wood treatment solutions provide protection against attack from Formosan termites and fungal decay.  It is not suitable for applications exposed to the weather or in-ground contact, and must be protected from exposure to liquid water and wet weather while in transit and while being stored at retail yards and job sites.  

	Standards and Approvals


		Meets American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards

		Meets State of Hawaii requirements for protection against Formosan termites

Wood Treatment
Would you like to enjoy the benefits of working with green wood knowing that your efforts will not be wasted by cracking and checking? With our wood stabilizers, your masterpiece will endure.
Use Pentacryl on your freshly cut green wood or Wood Juice to stabilize wood with a lower moisture content. Strengthen soft and punky wood with Polycryl or clean wood surfaces with Solvitol. Not ready to work with your wood yet, but want to prevent it from drying? Or you need to slow down the drying on that large piece, try our End Grain Sealer. Treat those large green logs, timbers and beams with our Log & Beam Treatment. It conditions and stabilizes the wood without forming a film. For protecting outside wood, try the Exterior Wood Sealer. This will prevent wood treated with our wood stabilizer from leaching out while still allowing the wood to breathe.

US Coating Solutions' system for decks. Stain Once and Protect with Flex-Clear Urethane!! 
US Coating Solutions' system for exterior wood                 restoration, wood protection and refinishing employs the next generation                 of high tech coating advances in order to provide exceptional durability                 that will  provide a sustainable                 beautiful finish. The system contains proven UV protection and complete                 anti-microbial protection for the life of the coating to include                 mold/mildew/algae prevention. 
You can stain your deck once with Saturant Stain and protect it for a lifetime with Flex-Clear Urethane when properly maintained.
Application is a three step process each being                 as important as the other:

Anti-Mold Soap is the authorized cleaning agent to kill mold,                   mildew and bacteria. It will clean the deck and prepare the deck                   for the stain and topcoat. Saturate the deck with Anti-Mold Soap,                   let it set for about 1/2 hour and power wash clean. 
Saturant Stain Concentrate contains our exclusive "Anti-Microbial                   System" that saturates into the wood and delivers stain very                   effect lively as well as our exclusive anti-microbial package protecting                   the wood from the inside from mold, mildew and pest infiltration.
Flex-Clear Urethane (matte, semi-gloss or gloss) is the recommended                   topcoat to protect the stain and deck, keeping it looking great                   for many years. Flex-Clear Urethane cross-links with the cellulose                   in the wood providing a very durable topcoat. Flex-Clear Urethane                   has proven to be a bullet proof finish that eliminates peeling                   and flaking. Flex-Clear Urethane forms a seamless bond                   that actually becomes part of the surface to which it is applied.                   It is highly UV resistant providing long term protection for the                   wood and the coating. Flex-Clear Urethane has been designed to                   provide superior performance where an advanced High Performance                   Coating is desired.




Why Conventional Deck Coatings Fail 


Cause of Failure
Conventional Deck Coatings
Deck Protection System from US Coating Solutions


Moisture 
Conventional Deck Coating Systems allow moisture and chemical                     penetration accelerating failure. 
Flex-Clear Urethane has unique properties that compensate                     for moisture in the wood protecting the deck from moisture with                     a durable and waterproof topcoat.


UV Rays
Conventional Deck Coating Systems do not have adequate UV                     protection and fade within 1 year.
Flex-Clear Urethane prevents UV Rays from deteriorating the                     stain for the life of the coating with proven UV protection.


Poor Adhesion
Surface coatings peel over time because they separate from                     the substrate due to normal weathering.
Saturant Stain Concentrate and Flex-Clear Urethane penetrate                     the surface and cross link with the substrate forming a tenacious                     bond that cannot peel.


Stress Cracking
Stress cracking is caused by the coatings inability to be                     as flexible as the substrate resulting in premature failure.                     All substrates move, expand and contract.
Our deck system cross-links to the substrate to form a seamless                     coating that expands and contracts with the substrate


Mold, Mildew and Bacteria
Conventional deck coatings are vulnerable to deterioration                     from fungi, bacteria and chemicals accelerating failure and                     poor appearance. 
Our Exterior Wood Protection contains "sustainable anti-microbial                     protection" for the life of the coating resulting in a                     system that lasts and looks great for many years without worry                     from mold, mildew or bacteria.


Durability
Conventional deck coatings contain acrylic resins designed                     to cover the substrate with chain polymers that do not hold                     up on decks.
Our Exterior Wood Protection contains a cross-linking system                     resulting 3D polymer chains with more durability and flexibility.


Improper Preparation and Application
Manufacturers of most deck coating systems provide generic                     application instructions and leave the consumer on their own.
US Coating Solutions evaluates each project to insure a successful                     outcome and provides application instructions for each project.                     We are also available for questions during the application process.




Flex-Clear Urethane provides a long term solution                 for wood protection that looks great for many years!!
