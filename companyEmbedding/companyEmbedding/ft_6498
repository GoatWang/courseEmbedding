                    The area that will be discussed in this local insight is at Woodrow and Gettysburg. I currently live in this neighborhood in a 3bd 2.5ba condo and I love it.

This area is the ideal location for anyone that likes to walk places because of all of the business that surround the area. There is the new development across from Fresno State with the Maya Movie Theater and the abundance of delicious restaurants including DogHouse. Costco and Winco are also a short drive away at Ashlan and Peach which makes that weekly shopping trip less of a errand. 

The best part of living in this neighborhood though is when the SaveMart Center is having a show you can walk there and back without paying for parking and dealing with the traffic. Also, when Fresno State is having a football game you can bypass all that traffic as well.
