What is Portus?





 Portus is a data mining, analysis and reporting platform that turns transactional data into analytically rich content delivered in an interactive, easy to use Web experience.

Designed by manufacturers, for manufacturers
Manufacturing is in our DNA. Portus is the culmination of our team's extensive manufacturing and ERP reporting software experience. As manufacturers, we know that strong data analytics capabilities are essential to running efficient operations, supporting a continuous improvement culture and making sound business decisions. We also found the process of creating the analysis needed to run our business inefficient, time consuming and ultimately frustrating.
Our vision resulted in a self-contained application that enables access to the information manufacturers need to make faster (and better) decisions, get tactical insights across key areas, and do a great job managing their business.


Plug and Play
Using Portus requires no additional skills or software. It is truly plug and play; plug in your data source and out pops a full featured business intelligence solution - reports, analytics and search capabilities that you need. All interactive with drill-downs.

 

Portus pays for itself immediately
Henry Ford once said "If you need a machine and don’t buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don’t have it."
Think about the most productive technology/machinery that you have on your shop floor. It leverages your investment (its cost and time you invested to get it there) and makes everyone that uses it more productive.
Because Portus is Plug and Play, there is literally no lag between the time it is installed and the time you start gaining tangible benefits; its time to value is immediate.  As all of our existing customers will tell you, Portus will bring returns on multiple fronts from making simple repetitive reporting tasks much faster, to organizing the analytical processes around certain key business drivers, to enabling management to quickly sift through the noise and get to the important analytics that allow streamlined decision making with better results.
We are so confident in the return on investment that Portus will bring to our customers that our sales model has been specifically engineered for immediate payback and to minimize risk. There are no large upfront investments or long-term commitments in order to get Portus. You pay for Portus on a monthly subscription basis and can cancel at any time. As a result you have a built-in mechanism to reassess your investment decision every month. We are confident that once you start using Portus, the investment rationale will be self-evident and that it will be an integral part of your overall tool chest for success.

What is Portus?





 Portus is a data mining, analysis and reporting platform that turns transactional data into analytically rich content delivered in an interactive, easy to use Web experience.

Designed by manufacturers, for manufacturers
Manufacturing is in our DNA. Portus is the culmination of our team's extensive manufacturing and ERP reporting software experience. As manufacturers, we know that strong data analytics capabilities are essential to running efficient operations, supporting a continuous improvement culture and making sound business decisions. We also found the process of creating the analysis needed to run our business inefficient, time consuming and ultimately frustrating.
Our vision resulted in a self-contained application that enables access to the information manufacturers need to make faster (and better) decisions, get tactical insights across key areas, and do a great job managing their business.


Plug and Play
Using Portus requires no additional skills or software. It is truly plug and play; plug in your data source and out pops a full featured business intelligence solution - reports, analytics and search capabilities that you need. All interactive with drill-downs.

 

Portus pays for itself immediately
Henry Ford once said "If you need a machine and don’t buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don’t have it."
Think about the most productive technology/machinery that you have on your shop floor. It leverages your investment (its cost and time you invested to get it there) and makes everyone that uses it more productive.
Because Portus is Plug and Play, there is literally no lag between the time it is installed and the time you start gaining tangible benefits; its time to value is immediate.  As all of our existing customers will tell you, Portus will bring returns on multiple fronts from making simple repetitive reporting tasks much faster, to organizing the analytical processes around certain key business drivers, to enabling management to quickly sift through the noise and get to the important analytics that allow streamlined decision making with better results.
We are so confident in the return on investment that Portus will bring to our customers that our sales model has been specifically engineered for immediate payback and to minimize risk. There are no large upfront investments or long-term commitments in order to get Portus. You pay for Portus on a monthly subscription basis and can cancel at any time. As a result you have a built-in mechanism to reassess your investment decision every month. We are confident that once you start using Portus, the investment rationale will be self-evident and that it will be an integral part of your overall tool chest for success.
