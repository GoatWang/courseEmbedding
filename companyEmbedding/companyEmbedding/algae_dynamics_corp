Unlike fish-based Omega-3 products, Algae Dynamics use of algae does not threaten the world's increasingly stressed fish stocks (which are predicted to collapse by 2050), nor does it risk PCV contamination or the problems occasionally associated with fish farming. Algae Dynamics is proud that its products contribute to a healthier planet for our children. 
Algae Dynamics technology is premised on extremely high efficiency, both in terms of footprint and carbon usage. Our proprietary algal production system, the BioSilo™, uses a unique CO2 delivery system that maximizes the absorption of the greenhouse gas by the algae. This creates a higher quality product while reducing its environmental impact. 
Algae Dynamics is also committed to social responsibility. Click here for our Statement on Social Responsibility and Fair Practices.

The result of these efforts is a new strategy to develop unique health and nutraceutical products utilizing cannabis, hemp and algae oils. Management believes that this strategy engenders both an immediate product development opportunity leading to near-term revenue and a longer-term vertically-integrated sustainable enterprise approach.The revised strategy resulted in a seven-step program for 2017 aimed at rapid implementation of this strategy, as follows:Research Agreement with University of Waterloo to investigate the use of cannabis oil in the context cancer -- $600,000, three-year program (signed February 24, 2017) Research Agreement with University of Western Ontario to investigate the use of cannabis derivatives for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health -- C$1,000,000, four-year program (signed March 13, 2017). Collaboration Agreement with ARA - Avanti Rx Analytics, a company approved by Health Canada, to extract, purify, manufacture, sell, import/export medical marihuana products (signed March 15, 2017). Sign supply agreements with cannabis producers, licensed by Health Canada. Select location suitable for future cannabis production. Apply to Health Canada for licence to produce, sell, import/export medical cannabis. Develop collaboration opportunity with pharmaceutical company.Paul Ramsay, Chairman and President of the Company said, "We believe this revised corporate strategy will allow us to build value for all stakeholders over both the near and longer terms. In the short-term we are fast-tracking to revenue growth. In the longer term, we believe we have a sustainable enterprise-building opportunity in a rapidly expanding market."The full slide deck is available at:  http://www.algaedynamics.com/files/ADC-Company-PPT-March-28-2017.pdfAbout Algae Dynamics CorpADC is currently engaged in the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals that utilize hemp, cannabis and algae oils.

NetworkNewsWire Releases Exclusive Audio Interview with Algae Dynamics Corp. (ADYNF)
























NEW YORK, NY, Jul 18, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jul 18, 2017) -  NetworkNewsWire ("NNW"), a multifaceted financial news and publishing company that delivers a new generation of social communication solutions for business, today announces the online availability of its interview with Algae Dynamics Corp. (otcqb:ADYNF).


                                        








The interview can be heard at         https://www.networknewswire.com/solutions/corporate-communications/interviews/algae-dynamics-corp-interview/









Kicking off the interview, NNW's Stuart Smith introduces Algae Dynamics Chairman and President Paul Ramsay, who provides insight into the company's operational focus on the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals utilizing cannabis, hemp and algae oils.


                                        








"We're working with cannabis in isolation, but we are also formulating different combinations of algae mixed with cannabis oils," he explains. "It's quite an interesting program and quite exciting given the health benefits."


                                        








Research for these formulations is conducted via multi-year partnerships with the University of Waterloo and the University of Western Ontario, which are focused on the application of cannabis oil for cancer and mental health issues, respectively. As noted later in the interview, Algae Dynamics has committed to a combined contribution of $1.6 million in the collaborations, and will retain all patents from the agreement without royalties. 


                                        








Ramsay next describes two ways in the Company plans to become the No. 1 cannabis oil product formulator, leveraging its expertise in algae oil extraction. 


                                        








"We're doing this because we have a lot of background with algae oil extraction," he says. "We have a lot of expertise, and we are rolling that into the cannabis oil extraction field. We are also combining the algae and the cannabis oil because it enhances the efficacy of treatment of the benefit of cannabis oils. There [is] a lot of research done, and we think [our team] will make some big strides in that area."


                                        








The interview also highlights the experience of key members of the Algae Dynamics' management team, and concludes with milestones the Company expects to achieve in 2017. In addition to signing supply service and sales agreements with several licensed producers, Algae Dynamics plans to select a location for its cannabis oil extraction production facility and gear up for an expected increase in cannabis demand in Canada. 


                                        








"We're going to apply for a Health Canada license to extract oil, and produce, sell and import/export for medical and eventually recreational cannabis, [which is] going to be legalized, per the prime minister of Canada, by July 1, 2018. So, there is going to be a huge ramp-up of demand," Ramsay says in conclusion.


                                        








About Algae Dynamics

        Algae Dynamics is engaged in the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals that utilize hemp, cannabis and algae oils. To assist in this development, Algae Dynamics engaged two Canadian universities to provide research, focusing on the use of cannabis oil in the context of cancer and the use of cannabis derivatives for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health. Algae Dynamics intends to utilize this research to develop products that combine the significant health benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids derived from algae oil with extracts from cannabis oil for the rapidly growing medical and non-medical markets in Canada and globally. The company has developed strategic relationships with licensed producers of cannabis to ensure a source of cannabis oil. Algae Dynamics' product development efforts are designed in the near-term for over-the-counter nutraceuticals, and in the longer-term for patented medicines. The company's recent initiatives are an extension of its previous plan, which was focused solely on commercialization of its proprietary BioSilo® algae cultivation system for the high volume, low cost production of pure contaminant-free algae biomass which is high in Omega-3 fatty acids.

Algae Dynamics Corp. (ADYNF) is Developing Therapies that Offer Safer Delivery of Cannabinoids
July 18, 2017




Focused on cannabis oil product development
Collaborating with Universities of Waterloo & Western Ontario in R&D
Strategy to capture market share of non-smoke MMJ products

For MMJ patients who don’t want to take up smoking, Algae Dynamics Corp. (OTCQB: ADYNF) is developing non-smoking delivery systems for cannabinoids. The company aims to produce new formulations of algae and cannabis oils that deliver health benefits without the attendant dangers that result from smoking.
Smoking is a killer. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that ‘cigarette smoking kills more than 480,000 Americans each year, with more than 41,000 of these deaths from exposure to secondhand smoke’ (http://dtn.fm/DkH6X). Smoking–related illness costs the U.S. economy ‘more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical care for adults and $156 billion in lost productivity’. Yet, tobacco use is a preventable cause of death and disease, which the 15 percent of the population who smoke can avoid, and many would do so if they are presented with non-smoking ways to use tobacco or cannabis.
Luckily, there is more than one way to skin the cannabis cat, for not only can it be smoked but it can be vaporized, and its oil can be extracted or tinctures may be made from it. Smoking is, undoubtedly, a common method of delivery. The simplest way of using cannabis is burning and smoking the (female) inflorescence. The flowers and buds of female plants contain the highest concentrations of cannabinoids, while male flowers contain much less. Leaves of both genders contain cannabinoids and may be mixed with the inflorescence to be smoked. Extracts from the plant are also processed to produce hashish, for example, which tends to be smoked as well. Cannabis is sometimes heated to produce a vapor that can be inhaled or the inflorescence may be immersed in a solvent, such as alcohol, to produce a tincture rich in cannabinoids.
The Algae Dynamics Corp. way, however, is the extraction of the oils from cannabis. In December 2016, the company announced a new oil extraction initiative in the Canadian cannabis industry (http://dtn.fm/ZbS8h). It plans to deploy its existing extraction technology of algae oil to cannabis. To supplement this initiative, ADYNF is expanding its research and product development (R&D) partnerships with Canadian academia, planning to sign supply, service and sales agreements with existing Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) licensed producers, and the company plans to submit an application to become a producer and seller of medical marijuana under the ACMPR.
The cannabis oil extraction industry is expected to hit C$1.7 billion by 2020. This exponential growth will, in part, be propelled by a desire for cannabinoid delivery methods that do not involve smoking. A study by Mackie Research Capital found that 45 percent of dried marijuana users in Colorado State would eventually convert to marijuana extracts and oils. If that is indicative of cannabis use generally, then ADYNF’s safer delivery methodology is soon likely to be very much in demand.

Algae Dynamics Corp Revised Business Strategy to Include Product Development Using Other Botanicals Such as Cannabis and Hemp



Share Article


















Management believes that this strategy engenders both an immediate product development opportunity leading to near-term revenue and a longer-term vertically-integrated sustainable enterprise approach.








Paul Ramsay, President said, “We believe this strategy will allow us to build value for all stakeholders over both the near and longer terms."


Toronto, Ontario, Canada (PRWEB)
March 30, 2017
 ALGAE DYNAMICS CORP (OTCQB: ADYNF) (the "Company" or “ADC”), a development stage company previously focused solely on commercialization of its proprietary BiloSilo™ system for the cultivation of highly-pure algae biomass, today announced a formal re-alignment of its business focus and strategy. 
The Company had previously announced, in December 2016, that it was considering ways to capitalize on synergies between its focus on algae cultivation and algae oil extraction, and oil extractions from other botanicals such as cannabis and hemp. The result of these efforts is a new strategy to develop unique health and nutraceutical products utilizing cannabis, hemp and algae oils. Management believes that this strategy engenders both an immediate product development opportunity leading to near-term revenue and a longer-term vertically-integrated sustainable enterprise approach.
The revised strategy resulted in a seven-step program for 2017 aimed at rapid implementation of this strategy, as follows:
1.    Research Agreement with University of Waterloo to investigate the use of cannabis oil in the context cancer - $600,000, three-year program (signed February 24, 2017).
2.    Research Agreement with University of Western Ontario to investigate the use of cannabis derivatives for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health - C$1,000,000, four-year program (signed March 13, 2017).
3.    Collaboration Agreement with ARA – Avanti Rx Analytics, a company approved by Health Canada, to extract, purify, manufacture, sell, import/export medical marijuana products (signed March 15, 2017).
4.    Sign supply agreements with cannabis producers, licensed by Health Canada.
5.    Select location suitable for future cannabis production.
6.    Apply to Health Canada for licence to produce, sell, import/export medical cannabis.
7.    Develop collaboration opportunity with pharmaceutical company.
Paul Ramsay, Chairman and President of the Company said, “We believe this revised corporate strategy will allow us to build value for all stakeholders over both the near and longer terms. In the short-term we are fast-tracking to revenue growth. In the longer term, we believe we have a sustainable enterprise-building opportunity in a rapidly expanding market.”

About Algae Dynamics Corp
ADC is currently engaged in the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals that utilize hemp, cannabis and algae oils. This is an extension of our plan to commercialize our proprietary BioSilo(R) algae cultivation system for the high volume, low cost production of pure contaminant-free algae biomass which is high in Omega-3 fatty acids. We have engaged two Canadian universities to provide research into the use of extracts from cannabis oil, which we plan to use to develop products that combine the significant health benefits of Omega-3s derived from algae oil and extracts from cannabis oil. Our research is focusing on the use of cannabis oil in the context of cancer, and the use of cannabis derivatives for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health.

Algae Dynamics Corp. (USOTC:ADYNF)Historical Stock Chart
6 Months : From Jan 2017 to Jul 2017


 TORONTO, CANADA / March 30, 2017, 9:30 AM EDT/ ALGAE DYNAMICS CORP (OTCQB: ADYNF) (the "Company" or "ADC"), a development stage company previously focused solely on commercialization of its proprietary BiloSilo™ system for the cultivation of highly-pure algae biomass, today announced a formal re-alignment of its business focus and strategy. The Company had previously announced, in December 2016, that it was considering ways to capitalize on synergies between its focus on algae cultivation and algae oil extraction, and oil extractions from other botanicals such as cannabis and hemp. The result of these efforts is a new strategy to develop unique health and nutraceutical products utilizing cannabis, hemp and algae oils. Management believes that this strategy engenders both an immediate product development opportunity leading to near-term revenue and a longer-term vertically-integrated sustainable enterprise approach.The revised strategy resulted in a seven-step program for 2017 aimed at rapid implementation of this strategy, as follows:Research Agreement with University of Waterloo to investigate the use of cannabis oil in the context cancer - $600,000, three-year program (signed February 24, 2017)Research Agreement with University of Western Ontario to investigate the use of cannabis derivatives for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health - C$1,000,000, four-year program (signed March 13, 2017).Collaboration Agreement with ARA - Avanti Rx Analytics, a company approved by Health Canada, to extract, purify, manufacture, sell, import/export medical marihuana products (signed March 15, 2017).Sign supply agreements with cannabis producers, licensed by Health Canada. Select location suitable for future cannabis production.Apply to Health Canada for licence to produce, sell, import/export medical cannabis.Develop collaboration opportunity with pharmaceutical company.Paul Ramsay, Chairman and President of the Company said, "We believe this revised corporate strategy will allow us to build value for all stakeholders over both the near and longer terms. In the short-term we are fast-tracking to revenue growth. In the longer term, we believe we have a sustainable enterprise-building opportunity in a rapidly expanding market."The full slide deck is available at: http://www.algaedynamics.com/files/ADC-Company-PPT...About Algae Dynamics CorpADC is currently engaged in the development of unique health products and pharmaceuticals that utilize hemp, cannabis and algae oils. This is an extension of our plan to commercialize our proprietary BioSilo(R) algae cultivation system for the high volume, low cost production of pure contaminant-free algae biomass which is high in Omega-3 fatty acids. We have engaged two Canadian universities to provide research into the use of extracts from cannabis oil, which we plan to use to develop products that combine the significant health benefits of Omega-3s derived from algae oil and extracts from cannabis oil. Our research is focusing on the use of cannabis oil in the context of cancer, and the use of cannabis derivatives for the development of novel pharmacotherapies for mental health.

Algae Dynamics Corp. (ADYNF) is “One to Watch”
June 21, 2017



Algae Dynamics Corp (OTCQB: ADYNF) is focused on developing proprietary research and products involving botanical oils derived from cannabis and algae.
The original core of the company’s product development strategy was the extraction of Omega-3 fatty acids from certain strains of algae with high concentrations of DHA to create various nutraceutical products. As a result of the many demonstrated health benefits of other botanical oils, most notably cannabis oil, Algae Dynamics developed a strategy aimed at developing products that combined the health benefits of algae and cannabis oils. Capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for cannabis oil and other smoke-free alternatives to marijuana consumption will help support ongoing initiatives to create and market research-driven product formulations.
Although the company is publicly traded in the U.S., business is conducted in Canada with no exposure to U.S. federal regulation involving cannabis. The Canadian cannabis oil extraction marketplace is projected to grow from C$1 million in 2015 to C$1.7 billion in 2020, which is more than a 1,000-fold increase. With the Government of Canada indicating a target date for full legalization on or before July 2018, numerous opportunities for sales in extracts and oils will open up very soon.
Using Colorado as a comparable example, a study performed by Mackie Research Capital found that 45% of dried marijuana users in the state would eventually convert to marijuana extracts and oils. This is because most consumers taking cannabis for medical purposes are increasingly looking for delivery systems that do not involve smoking marijuana. The market’s attractiveness can be further realized when considering that the Canada’s licensed producer marketplace is far less competitive with 45 current licensed producers for the whole country vs. 624 licensed cultivators in Colorado.
Collaborating with prominent Canadian universities is a core part of the Algae Dynamics’ plan to bolster cannabis extraction expertise, develop premium products and add to its portfolio of intellectual property. Through its agreements with the University of Waterloo and the University of Western Ontario, the company is focusing primarily on the use of extracts from cannabis oil and algae oil in the context of cancer as well as the development of new pharmacotherapies for mental health.
Near-term goals include expanding research and development work with existing and new Canadian universities, securing supply/service agreements with licensed producers, and submitting an application to Health Canada to become a licensed producer of medical marijuana and ultimately have a license to sell products derived from cannabinoids. Algae Dynamics also owns a proprietary technology for the cultivation of low cost, highly pure algae biomass, which will be developed as a vertical integration strategy in the future to support the need to source algae oil for research-driven product formulations. The management team leading these initiatives has nearly a century of beneficial experience spanning from management and process experience to successful fund raising and commercialization.
As part of its key objective to be the #1 research Canadian cannabis oil research-driven product formulator, the company has also formed a strong team of scientific and strategic advisors that complement ongoing R&D relationships and initiatives. Individuals who support the company’s initiatives include Dr. Jonathan Blay PhD, FRSB, FIBMS, Csci, CBiol, who performs research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of colorectum, pancreas, breast and prostate cancers; and Dr. Steven Laviolette, BSc, PhD, who performs research and product development on cannabis oil and its constituents in the context of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and schizophrenia.
With such a strong foundation laid in the areas being pursued, Algae Dynamics is well positioned to execute on its carefully developed business plan to fast-track to revenue growth while having a longer-term strategy to build a sustainable enterprise-building opportunity in a rapidly expanding market.
