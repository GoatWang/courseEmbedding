					Full Description



Flex Pharma, Inc., incorporated on February 26, 2014, is a biotechnology company that is developing treatments for nocturnal leg cramps, muscle cramps and spasms associated with severe neuromuscular conditions, and exercise associated muscle cramps (EAMCs). The Company's product candidates activate certain receptors in primary sensory neurons, which then act through neuronal circuits to reduce the repetitive firing, or hyperexcitability, of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord, thereby preventing or reducing the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms. The Company operates through developing and commercializing products for nocturnal leg cramps, muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neuromuscular conditions, and exercise-associated muscle cramps segment. The Company's product candidates are based on the mechanism of action described as Chemical Neuro Stimulation, which is the process by which a small molecule chemical signal, acting topically, is translated into a neuronal sensory signal that produces a beneficial effect. The Company's lead drug product candidate is FLX-787, which is in the Phase II clinical trial stage. It is developing products using TRP activators.The Company intends to pursue the use of its drug product candidates in several other conditions where muscle cramps, spasms or abnormal muscle contractions afflict patients, including spasms due to brain injury, such as in stroke or cerebral palsy or trauma, cervical dystonia, spasticity as a result of spinal cord injury, focal dystonias (e.g. blepharospasm), peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetic), fibromyalgia, Machado-Joseph disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, cramp fasciculation syndrome, cramps due to dialysis, spasmodic dysphonia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, piriformis syndrome, lower lumbar radiculopathy and neuromyotonias (focal). It is developing a consumer brand and products specifically formulated to treat athletes suffering from EAMCs.The Company competes with Xenoport, Inc. and GW Pharma.

The Absurdity of Flex Pharma IPO: 2 Spices and a Veg Net $86M









Adam Feuerstein




Jan 29, 2015 7:44 AM EST













 




























































 The biotech industry's Arctic ice-cube salesman Cristoph Westphal managed to raise $86 million Wednesday night in an initial public offering to develop a treatment for leg cramps made from food ingredients commonly found in your spice drawer and refrigerator. If the biotech bull market hasn't reached 11 on the absurdity meter quite yet, the Flex Pharma (FLKS) IPO gets us darn close. Flex's "proprietary" treatment for leg cramps -- prescription and over-the-counter retail versions to be developed -- is made from extracts of ginger, cinnamon and capsicum, otherwise known as bell peppers, according to its registration statement. Wednesday night's offering sold 5.4 million shares of Flex at $16 per share, higher than the expected $12-14 pricing range. If the offering's over-allotment is also sold, Flex will raise $99 million. Westphal, Flex's co-founder and CEO, seemingly has a knack for convincing unsuspecting investors and pharma companies to buy his food-as-medicine concoctions. Among his past dealings, Westphal founded and then sold Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was developing resveratrol (a component of red wine) as an age-defying miracle drug, to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for $700 million. Glaxo later wrote off its Sirtris investment after the resveratrol compound turned out to be a dud. More recently, Westphal co-founded and served as first CEO of Verastem (VSTM) , a developer of drugs based on cancer stem cells, which went public in January 2012 at $10 per share. None of Verastem's pipeline drugs have worked out so far and the stock closed Wednesday at $7.53. In the same time frame, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 186%.

Seeing is Believing
How Curiosity Killed the Cramp
 


Our Company
Novel Treatments for Neuromuscular Disorders, including Muscle Cramps
There is currently no proven or effective product for muscle cramps and spasms.
Most muscle cramps are not caused by dehydration, lactic acid, electrolyte imbalance, or muscle tightness. That is why popular remedies like sports drinks, bananas, magnesium tablets, and stretching are usually ineffective.
New research has shown that cramps and spasms do not originate in the muscle itself, but are caused instead by a neural mechanism: excessive firing of the motor neurons in the spinal cord that control muscle contraction.
Flex Pharma is developing products to address muscle cramps and spasms by halting repetitive firing of the motor neurons.
Our founders include professors from Harvard Medical School and Rockefeller University (Nobel prize, 2003).

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in
this offering will be approximately $78.5 million (or $90.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares from us in
full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. $30.1 million to fund research and development efforts of our drug product 
  candidates for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps and spasms associated 
  with severe neuromuscular conditions; 

. $11.1 million for the sales and marketing efforts to launch our consumer 
  brand and products; and 

. the remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, which 
  may include the acquisition or licensing of drug product candidates, 
  technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses. 

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
progress of our pre-clinical and clinical development efforts. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds from this
offering. Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
for the acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of drug product
candidates, technologies, compounds, other assets or complementary businesses,
we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so. Pending
these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations through
2017, including through completion of at least one proof-of-concept study of our
proprietary treatment for individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps under
the dietary supplement regulatory framework in the United States, the continued
development of our pre-clinical drug product candidates, and the initiation of a
Phase 2 clinical trial and through the launch of our consumer brand and
cornerstone product. If the results of our proof-of-concept study of our
proprietary treatment are not favorable, we intend to pursue the development of
drug product candidates using the TRP activators in our proprietary treatment
for other indications where muscle cramps, spasms or abnormal muscle
contractions afflict patients. We have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly
advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary
products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and
scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential
competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical,
specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and
governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug
product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete
with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the
future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our drug product
candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety,
price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and
other third-party payors.

For nocturnal leg cramps, systemic treatments, such as dietary supplements,
vasodilators and calcium channel blockers, have shown some benefit, but we do
not believe any medication has shown evidence of clinical efficacy. Quinine is
taken by some individuals outside the United States but the FDA banned the
over-the-counter use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in
1994 and it is presently available only for the prescription treatment of
malaria and its labeling contains a boxed warning against use in treating
nocturnal leg cramps.

For patients suffering from MS spasticity, the current treatments include muscle
relaxants, sedatives and Botox injections. Other biotechnology companies are
currently developing drug products to treat MS spasticity, including
Xenoport, Inc., which is developing a r-Baclofen Prodrug, and GW Pharma, which
is developing Sativex.

Botox injection is the most commonly used treatment for cervical dystonia. SCI
spasticity is treated with physical therapy, including surface electrical
stimulation, surgery or drug therapy, including muscle relaxants, sedatives or
Botox injections.

We believe our consumer product for the prevention of EAMCs will compete against
traditional beverage companies, sports beverage companies and companies
developing dietary supplements. We believe the principal elements of competition
in the consumer product industry will be price, brand recognition, distribution
channel offerings and the effectiveness of the product. We do not expect any
third-party payors to cover and reimburse for our consumer products.


Company Description
We are a biotechnology company that is developing innovative and proprietary
treatments for nocturnal leg cramps and spasms associated with severe
neuromuscular conditions. Novel insights regarding neuromuscular physiology from
our co-founders form the basis of our development efforts. We believe


 that
activation of certain receptors in primary sensory neurons reduces the
repetitive firing, or hyperexcitability, of alpha-motor neurons, thereby
preventing or reducing the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms.
We also believe that we are the only company developing products based on this
mechanism of muscle cramp and spasm inhibition. We have conducted three
randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over studies of our proprietary
treatment, which have shown a statistically significant reduction in the
intensity of muscle cramps induced in healthy normal volunteers. We intend to
initially focus our drug development efforts on developing a product to treat
nocturnal leg cramps. There is no drug product currently available in the United
States that has been approved to treat nocturnal leg cramps.

In the second quarter of 2015, we intend to initiate at least one human
proof-of-concept study of our proprietary treatment for individuals who suffer
from nocturnal leg cramps. Nocturnal leg cramps are muscle cramps that occur
during sleep and can cause distress, interrupted sleep, reduced quality of life
and interference with activities of daily living. We believe our primary target
patient population will include individuals that suffer from nocturnal leg
cramps daily or weekly and, based on independent third-party survey results, we
estimate that approximately four million U.S. adults over the age of 65 suffer
from nocturnal leg cramps on a daily basis. Nocturnal leg cramps also affect
people younger than 65 and we believe there is an opportunity to serve this
patient population as well.

A muscle cramp is a sudden and painful contraction of a muscle that may last
several minutes and, in many instances, results in soreness lasting several
days. Frequently experienced by patients with severe neuromuscular conditions,
such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, or SCI, spasticity is an
abnormal, involuntary tightness of muscles and is characterized by uncontrolled
movement, muscle stiffness, difficulty straightening joints, reduced mobility,
limb weakness, shaking, intermittent spasms and pain. Dystonias are
characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal,
often repetitive, movements, postures or both.

Recent research has shown that muscle cramping is caused by the uncontrolled and
repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in
maintained contraction of the muscle. We believe that by reducing this firing of
the alpha-motor neurons that control muscle contraction, muscle cramping can be
reduced or prevented. Motor neurons respond to inputs from complex circuits in
the spinal cord that both reduce neuronal and muscle activity, known as
"inhibitory" input, and increase neuronal and muscle activity, known as
"excitatory" input. Our approach exploits a general principle of neural
circuits — that strong excitatory input from one source in the body enhances the
overall inhibitory tone in the spinal cord and thereby reduces neuronal response
to other excitation throughout the body. We believe this reduction of neuron
excitation has the effect of reducing muscle cramps and spasms.

Our proprietary treatment stimulates primary sensory neurons in the mouth,
esophagus and stomach by activating transient receptor potential, or TRP, cation
channel receptors. We believe that the effects of the TRP activators in our 
proprietary treatment directly interact with the TRP subfamily A, member 1, or 
TRPA1, and TRP vanilloid-1 receptor, or TRPV1, ion channels in a topical and 
local fashion to yield strong, centrally acting excitatory inputs from primary 
sensory neurons. We believe that the signals activated in the TRPA1 and TRPV1 
ion channels are channeled directly to the spinal cord, creating an inhibitory 
effect from the central nervous system on alpha-motor neurons throughout the 
body, thereby reducing neuron excitation and muscle cramps. Moreover, we 
believe that the physical properties of the TRP activators largely limit their 
action to sensory neurons in the mouth, esophagus and stomach, with minimal 
concentrations reaching the bloodstream and, consequently, fewer potential 
systemic side-effects. Muscle contractions associated with dystonia and 
spasticity are also believed to result from abnormal repetitive firing of 
alpha-motor neurons. Our proprietary treatment contains three active 
ingredients: (1) ginger extract, an activator of both TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion 
channels, (2) cinnamon extract, an activator of TRPA1 ion channels, and (3) 
capsicum, an activator of TRPV1 ion channels. 

We may also initiate human proof-of-concept studies of our proprietary treatment
in patients outside the United States that suffer from spasms associated with
severe neuromuscular conditions and other conditions where patients experience
abnormal muscle contractions, including multiple sclerosis, cervical dystonia
and SCI. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke, between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States suffer from
multiple sclerosis, or MS, approximately 84% of whom experience spasticity.
According to the National Spasmodic Torticollis Association, cervical dystonia
affects approximately 90,000 people in the United States and we estimate, based
on industry sources, that spasticity following SCI affects at least 150,000
people in the United States.

In parallel with the development of our drug product candidates, all of which
are currently in the pre-clinical phase of development, we are also developing a
consumer brand with products based on the same mechanism of action as our
proprietary treatment. Our consumer brand and products will be targeted towards
athletes experiencing exercise-associated muscle cramps, or EAMCs. EAMCs are
painful, spasmodic and involuntary contractions of skeletal muscle that occur
during or following exercise in individuals with no underlying metabolic,
neurological or endocrine pathology. EAMCs can be experienced by individuals
participating in any sport but are particularly prevalent in athletes that
engage in high-intensity activities, such as running, cycling and triathlons.
There are a number of well-known sports drinks and other consumer products used
to prevent EAMCs. However, we do not believe any of these products have been
proven to be clinically effective in preventing EAMCs. We have commenced
formulation and commercialization efforts of our cornerstone product to address
this attractive market and we anticipate launching our consumer brand and
cornerstone product in the first half of 2016. While our consumer product and
any eventual drug product we may develop may contain the same active
ingredients, we believe the TRP activators in our consumer product will not be
purified and will be at lower amounts than the TRP activators in any future drug
product.
