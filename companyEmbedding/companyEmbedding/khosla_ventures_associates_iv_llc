Download White Paper View AllEntrepreneur ResourcesA philosophical view of what boards should and should not doThe right advisor asks the questions you never knew were important. Instead of focusing on regular board “governance,” we ask CEOs to focus on the most critical and pivotal risks, questions and opportunities facing the company. Read Article View AllENTREPRENEUR ResourcesCompany buildingThe main thing you’re trying to do in startups is optimize risk management. The real test of a company is the tradeoffs you make and how much courage and conviction you have to pursue the billion dollar vision while doing the million dollar tactics.

What we work on | Khosla Ventures                                   What we work on  At KV, we fundamentally like large problems that are amenable to technology solutions. We seek out unfair advantages: proprietary and protected technological advances, business model innovations, unique partnerships and top-notch teams.  Broadly, a venture we back offers one or more of the factors below.Significant technology or business model innovationUnusual technology approaches, ventures into new markets or contrarian approaches to existing markets.“Black Swan” ideas with significant upside or a significantly better mousetrapBlack swans are high-impact innovations beyond the realm of normal expectations. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb put it, black swans are characterized by rarity, extreme impact and retrospective predictability.High-impact investments can change the dynamics of large markets. Can we alter the design of an engine to substantially change its efficiency and make it more economic than hybrid drivetrains? Can we make cleaner building materials? Going beyond normal expectations means we take on the challenge of rethinking the familiar. Can we store energy in elements other than lithium? Or can we make lithium-ion batteries better?Large markets, either existing or newly enabled by the innovation at hand Will you disrupt a large existing market? We love breaking monopolies. Or can you find a billion dollar market (versus a million dollar market) with a credible path to grow?Short innovation cyclesStartups by nature take on more risk than larger, established competitors. However, the nature of startups also adds significant difficulty to getting large, capital-intensive projects up and running. Instead, we look for rapid innovation cycles so proof points and results are available quickly (whether good or bad). That said, we also break our own rules; we have invested in a nuclear reactor with long innovation cycles because other factors were compelling.Upfront riskEvery plan has risks, and we both understand and cherish risk. But we prefer technology risk to market risk, and we prefer to remove technology and business risks up front. Clearly identified and understood risks, along with a cogent plan for removing those risks for the least amount of money, is an important criteria for evaluating ventures. It is more advantageous to all parties to fail in six months and on $75,000 than in six years and $75 million — we want to focus on the key risks early.If you have a compelling technology-based story or are exceptionally accomplished or credentialed, we are willing to listen. We are not looking for good ROI; we are looking to build companies. In our view, the ROI follows the company building. We will help you redefine your plan to meet these criteria if the technology breakthroughs are significant.   Contact Us | Khosla Ventures                                   Contact Us  To be considered for funding, please email a full business plan to kv@khoslaventures.com.Job seekers with exceptional qualifications, interested in positions with our portfolio companies should email jobs@khoslaventures.com.2128 Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, CA 94025Phone: 650-376-8500 Fax: 650-926-9590  How we work | Khosla Ventures                                   How we work  Our focus and mission: assisting entrepreneursWe assist great entrepreneurs determined to build companies with lasting  significance.Knowing and doing what it takes to foster winnersWe are in the company-building business, not the “deal” or “capital” business. We have a history of leveraging relationships to build teams, attract partners and customers and then–together–build billion dollar businesses.We are active partners who do everything we can for our companies and have not forgotten how to hustle. We get our hands dirty.Strategic advice, creative ideasWe opine on and sometimes help refine business plans. We love working together to turn something good into something great. Are we working to protect against the worst that can happen? Are we leveraging the upside? Are we planning for assets as well as liabilities? When good isn’t good enough, we help you think outside the box, and we help you change the rules. Every business goes through pivotal moments – cave on a term or lose a customer, cancel the product line or keep it in market, make a key hiring decision. We have made most of these mistakes before. Now, we can help or find someone in our portfolio who can help you think through what to do.A direct, straightforward styleWe prefer brutal honesty to hypocritical politeness. We seldom vote against management teams in our board roles, but we can have strong opinions. We will challenge you without confronting you. Once we pick a management team, we back it and don’t second-guess it. We are less about sweet talk and more about helping you build a business. We are definitely not about controlling ownership in your business.    Resources | Khosla Ventures                                   Resources    EntrepreneurshipThe resource-rich lifestyle seven hundred million people enjoy is one for which seven billion people are still striving. Technology-based entrepreneurship, may be the only necessary, if not sufficient, response to meet the global population’s desires for a better life. This is the promise of Silicon Valley. Get started.   Standard operating proceduresAt Khosla Ventures, we offer real targeted help to entrepreneurs. As part of that, we have a set of standard operating procedures that will guide you in building a lasting company.   Growth marketingStartups are defined by growth. Many entrepreneurs have fever dreams about creating a product that takes the world by storm—the next Google, Facebook or WhatsApp—and investors have similar visions of funding them. Behind product, growth is the single most important thing on which startups should focus. Learn more.   Team buildingA company becomes the people it hires. Successful startups seldom follow their original plans. Teams not only determine how risk is handled but also evolve to better utilize opportunities and address and redefine risks. Learn how to make the platitude of “hire great people” an actionable and quantifiable process.   Design/UXWhether it’s hardware or software innovation, design has the power to make even the most complicated technology usable, useful and delightful.  Good designers will be drawn to inspiring missions and companies where they feel they can do great work. Learn how you can create an environment where design will be successful.

Khosla Ventures is an American venture capital firm focused on early stage companies in the Internet, computing, mobile, silicon technology, biotechnology, healthcare and clean technology sectors that was founded by Vinod Khosla.[1][2]
The firm is based in Menlo Park, California, and manages approximately $1.3 billion of investor capital as well as earlier funds funded by Khosla.
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 2004 by Vinod Khosla, a former general partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The firm's first two investment vehicles were funded with Khosla's own personal capital and were not open to institutional investors. In March 2009, Pierre Lamond became General Partner.[3] In December 2009, Khosla completed fundraising for two new funds, to invest in cleantech and information technology start-ups.
Khosla Ventures Fund III secured $1 billion of investor commitments to invest in traditional early stage and growth stage companies. Khosla also raised $300 million for Khosla Seed, which will invest in higher-risk opportunities and science experiments.[4] The firm has invested in bio-refineries for energy and bioplastics, solar, wind, battery, engines, LED, HVAC efficiency and other environmentally friendly technologies.[5][6] The company focuses on technology risk based investing in very large markets.
Some companies funded by Khosla Ventures include: Academia.edu, Amyris, Bloom Energy, DB Networks, EcoMotors, Cosaint Technologies, GreatPoint Energy, Neverware, Panzura, SeaMicro, Tapingo, Cogenra Solar, Snip.it, Instacart, Relcy and Thync. [7][8]
As of October 2015[update], Khosla Ventures is one of the five largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[9]
