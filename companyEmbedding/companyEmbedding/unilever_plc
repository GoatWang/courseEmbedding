Unilever And IRi Invest In MachineVantage For Marketing AI - Unilever Plc (NYSE:UL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Unilever And IRi Invest In MachineVantage For Marketing AIJul. 5.17 | About: Unilever Plc (UL) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryConsumer products giant Unilever and IRi have invested an undisclosed amount in MachineVantage.MachineVantage is developing machine-learning and AI-enabled algorithms to maximize consumer product development and marketing.Unilever, which has already piloted MachineVantage's system, stands to gain faster product development and better marketing ROI.By adopting AI-driven consumer marketing that discovers unconscious consumer drives on a product basis, Unilever risks consumer charges of manipulatory practices.



 Quick Take Unilever Ventures (UL) and IRi have teamed up to invest in marketing machine learning and artificial intelligence firm MachineVantage. MachineVantage is developing advanced AI-driven methods to more effectively discover and market consumer goods products. Unilever hopes to expand the use of MachineVantage’s AI insights into unconscious consumer demand drivers, but should proceed carefully, lest it provoke a consumer backlash against AI manipulation. Investee Company Berkeley, California-based MachineVantage was founded in 2016 to provide consumer products firms with improved methods of discovering product innovation potential and improving their digital and retail point of sale messaging. Management is headed by founder A.K. Pradeep, who says he has ‘pioneered the field of neuromarketing, the application of advanced neuroscience to marketing.’ MachineVantage aims to provide three main services:
  Trend Spotting – A ‘scientific approach’ to the product innovation ideation process Product Innovation – Discover important variables that result in successful product design Messaging – Assists in the development of a meta-marketing model that is ‘pre-emptive not reactive’  Investment Terms and Rationale The amount of the financing round was not disclosed by the participants, and given MachineVantage’s young age, I suspect it was likely for under $10 million. As part of the investment, IRi will integrate MachineVantage’s algorithms with its Liquid Data platform to create a combination that can be used by brand marketers such as Unilever on a greater scale. Unilever had previously worked with MachineVantage, with ‘several of Unilever’s largest brands, operating across many of the countries where those brands are well-established consumer favorites, including in emerging markets.’ As Stan Sthanunathan, EVP Consumer & Market Insights at Unilever stated in the deal announcement, It is crucial to understand consumer trends and preferences and to determine how our brands can best respond to people's evolving needs. We are already using artificial intelligence and machine learning to gain insights that our product development and marketing teams can translate quickly and effectively into innovations. A year of working with MachineVantage convinced us of the unique power of their technology and the value of our investment. With Unilever’s 400 brands worldwide, it seeks to garner early-mover opportunities with the implementation of machine learning and AI to improve its brand development, innovation time-to-market and consumer messaging. However, I’m concerned about the potential for abuse with MachineVantage’s technologies. As its CEO says, ‘What makes MachineVantage stand out is our deep understanding of the foundational principles driving consumer purchase behavior combined with our unique algorithms that process information that consumers imbibe under the threshold of conscious consumption.’ [Italics mine]
 So, essentially MachineVantage, a play on the phrase, ‘Machine Advantage,' says it can determine the unconscious drives and processes that consumers exhibit, and adjust a company’s messaging to take advantage of that knowledge at the point of sale. In many countries, subliminal advertising or marketing is either illegal or considered speech that is not protected. While I’m not asserting that MachineVantage’s technologies meet the full definition of subliminal, if its ‘Digital and Creative Messaging’ services take advantage of that greatly improved knowledge of ‘information that consumers imbibe under the threshold of conscious consumption’, the company or its clients will be armed with far greater power to manipulate the consumer unconscious by virtue of their machine-learning technologies. Unilever, and other consumer product marketers, would be wise to tread carefully in their use of artificial intelligence to achieve their sales goals. If consumers feel manipulated by an ever-increasing artificial intelligence, the results could be unpredictable. I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK.

In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]
Operations[edit]
Unilever is organised into four main divisions: Personal Care (production and sale of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products); Foods (production and sale of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads); Refreshment (production and sale of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight-management products and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets); and Home Care (production and sale of home care products including powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and other cleaning products).[78] In the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Unilever had a total turnover of €49.797 billion of which 36% was from Personal Care, 27% from Foods, 19% from Refreshment and 18% from Home Care.[78] Unilever invested a total of €1.04 billion in research and development in 2013.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]

In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]
Operations[edit]
Unilever is organised into four main divisions: Personal Care (production and sale of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products); Foods (production and sale of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads); Refreshment (production and sale of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight-management products and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets); and Home Care (production and sale of home care products including powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and other cleaning products).[78] In the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Unilever had a total turnover of €49.797 billion of which 36% was from Personal Care, 27% from Foods, 19% from Refreshment and 18% from Home Care.[78] Unilever invested a total of €1.04 billion in research and development in 2013.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]

On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]
Operations[edit]
Unilever is organised into four main divisions: Personal Care (production and sale of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products); Foods (production and sale of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads); Refreshment (production and sale of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight-management products and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets); and Home Care (production and sale of home care products including powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and other cleaning products).[78] In the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Unilever had a total turnover of €49.797 billion of which 36% was from Personal Care, 27% from Foods, 19% from Refreshment and 18% from Home Care.[78] Unilever invested a total of €1.04 billion in research and development in 2013.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

In March 2011 it was announced that Unilever had entered into a binding agreement to sell the Sanex brand to Colgate-Palmolive for €672 million, and that Unilever would acquire Colgate-Palmolive's laundry detergent brands in Colombia (Fab, Lavomatic and Vel) for US$215 million.[44] In April 2011 Unilever was fined €104 million by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel in Europe along with P&G, who was fined €211.2 million, and Henkel (not fined). Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Unilever is organised into four main divisions: Personal Care (production and sale of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products); Foods (production and sale of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads); Refreshment (production and sale of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight-management products and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets); and Home Care (production and sale of home care products including powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and other cleaning products).[78] In the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Unilever had a total turnover of €49.797 billion of which 36% was from Personal Care, 27% from Foods, 19% from Refreshment and 18% from Home Care.[78] Unilever invested a total of €1.04 billion in research and development in 2013.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Unilever is organised into four main divisions: Personal Care (production and sale of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products); Foods (production and sale of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads); Refreshment (production and sale of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight-management products and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets); and Home Care (production and sale of home care products including powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and other cleaning products).[78] In the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Unilever had a total turnover of €49.797 billion of which 36% was from Personal Care, 27% from Foods, 19% from Refreshment and 18% from Home Care.[78] Unilever invested a total of €1.04 billion in research and development in 2013.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Best Stocks In Personal Products: Unilever PLC and Estee Lauder Companies Inc
Unilever and Estee Lauder are two standout players in the slow-growth personal products sector.

Personal product stocks are often considered defensive plays in a volatile market, because demand is generally non-cyclical. Unfortunately, currency impacts can take a big bite out of earnings, while sluggish sales growth can cause stocks to underperform the market. Today, we'll cut through the losers and discuss two promising plays in the sector -- Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL). 
UnileverUnilever, which is co-headquartered in London and Rotterdam, owns a portfolio of over 400 brands. However, the company mainly focuses on boosting sales of its top 13 brands with annual sales of over 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) each, which include Dove, Axe, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, and Rexona.

Unilever's brands. Source: Unilever.
Unilever's "underlying" sales -- which excludes currency impacts, acquisitions, and brand disposals -- rose 5.7% annually during the third quarter, up from 2.9% growth in the second quarter. Unilever attributed that growth to a strong ice cream season in southern Europe, a competitor's recall in North America, and the phasing of Latin American sales between the third and fourth quarters. 57% of Unilever's sales come from emerging markets.
Unlike its U.S.-based rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Unilever benefits from a stronger dollar because it reports earnings in euros, which have been weak against the dollar for most of the year. Last quarter, currency impacts boosted Unilever's total revenues by 2.9%. Unilever estimates that if exchange rates hold steady, currency tailwinds will add 5% to sales and 2% to its EPS for the full year. 





Unilever expects its full-year underlying sales to rise 2% to 4%. By comparison, P&G posted a 12% drop in sales last quarter, with currency impacts accounting for nine percentage points of that decline. P&G's organic growth, which is comparable to Unilever's underlying growth, slipped 2%. In addition to better growth numbers, Unilever's P/E of 24 is also cheaper than P&G's P/E of 28, and comparable to the industry average of 24 for personal product stocks. However, P&G's forward annual dividend yield of 3.5% is slightly higher than Unilever's 3.1% yield.
Estee LauderThe crowded beauty category within personal products can be a tough one to succeed in. However, Estee Lauder has remained fiercely competitive, thanks to its portfolio of well-established brands like Aveda, Donna Karan, MAC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, and Clinique.

Estee Lauder's top brands. Source: Estee Lauder.
Last quarter, Estee Lauder's revenues rose 7.6% annually to $2.83 billion, which exceeded estimates by $50 million. Currency impacts reduced overall sales by $198 million. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), its two biggest markets, respectively rose 14% and 8%. Asia-Pacific revenues, which accounted for 19% of its top line, fell 4% due to a "softer retail climate" in China and the MERS impact in South Korea. But looking ahead, Estee Lauder expects new e-commerce partnerships, department store counter openings, and lower import taxes on skin care products to boost sales in China. 





All four of Estee Lauder's main product categories -- skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care -- posted positive year-over-year growth during the quarter. Gross margins also remained unchanged from the prior year quarter at nearly 80%. Excluding currency impacts, sales are expected to rise 8% to 10% annually in fiscal 2016. On the bottom line, Estee Lauder's net earnings rose 36% to $309.3 million, or diluted earnings of $0.82 per share. Currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. Estee Lauder also raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.30, which gives it a forward annual yield of 1.5% at current prices.
Estee Lauder's numbers look solid, but investors should beware of the stock's valuation. With a trailing P/E of about 28, Estee Lauder trades at a premium to both the S&P 500 and the personal products industry. Nonetheless, Estee Lauder remains a "best in breed" stock in the tough beauty products market and a top personal products stock.
The key takeawaysUnilever's and Estee Lauder's recent earnings highlight the significance of currency impacts and the strength of well-known brands. While many growth-oriented investors might ignore personal products stocks altogether, they should note that both stocks have easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 12 months.

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Unilever is organised into four main divisions: Personal Care (production and sale of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products); Foods (production and sale of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads); Refreshment (production and sale of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight-management products and nutritionally enhanced staples sold in developing markets); and Home Care (production and sale of home care products including powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and other cleaning products).[78] In the financial year ended 31 December 2013, Unilever had a total turnover of €49.797 billion of which 36% was from Personal Care, 27% from Foods, 19% from Refreshment and 18% from Home Care.[78] Unilever invested a total of €1.04 billion in research and development in 2013.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]

In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

The company's products cover two categories: food and home, and personal care. Its brands include Axe, Dove, Pond's, Suave, Vaseline, Signal, Snuggle, Surf, Slim Fast, Lipton, Ben & Jerry's, Breyers, and Country Crock. Unilever maintains two headquarters locations in the Netherlands and the UK. 

Procurement Process:
The company's group procurement organization oversees both direct procurement (consisting of materials necessary for product development and manufacture) and indirect procurement (consisting of items supporting internal business operations). IT is managed within the company's indirect procurement processes. The Chief Procurement Officer is located in Singapore.
IT Priorities:
•Risk management systems within IT systems supporting all business areas are being centralized and automated.
•Gradually investing in modernizing IT infrastructure.
•Developing new digital marketing strategies is an important part of the company's long term business strategy.

2013 and Previously:

Unilever is a worldwide manufacturer of packaged consumer goods operating in Asia, Africa, North America, the Middle East, Western Europe, and Latin America. The company's products cover two categories: food and home, and personal care. Its brands include Axe, Dove, Pond's, Suave, Vaseline, Signal, Snuggle, Surf, Slim Fast, Lipton, Ben & Jerry's, Breyers, and Country Crock. Unilever is part of the Unilever Group owned by the Netherlands-based Unilever N.V. and UK-based Unilever PLC.

The Global CIO, who is located at the company's headquarters in London, leads the IT department at Unilever. Another key figure in the department is the Chief Technology Officer, whose focus is on IT architecture, as well as global information security.

These top executives rely on vice presidents whose duties range from company-wide initiatives dealing with SAP to the provision of IT services. For example, there is an executive in charge of information management who is dedicated to ensuring that the local and divisional level business leaders get financial reports with the level of aggregation appropriate to their level of responsibility. Other executives with a regional focus manage IT for Europe, regional application integration, and IT for the AMETCEE region.

Two of the VPs and a director handle the provision of IT services on a regional basis. The VP of Enterprise Computing Services is concerned with the data center initiatives in Europe. The VP of Global IT Services manages service desk operations, telecommunications, and networks. The Director of Global IT Innovation handles other aspects of IT services and business partnering, including agreements for application services.

The company relies on key outsourcing partners in some areas. To manage these relationships, the Director of Global Services is involved with service delivery. Preparing and monitoring the contracts involves the Director of Global IT Finance, whose duties include the financial aspects involved in preparing the outsourcing agreement, but also in the benchmarking and performance monitoring necessary once the contracts are in place.

Other IT directors handle financial applications and strategic architecture. There are also managers working on security architecture and SAP services. There is also a business application architect working with the CTO and an IT business partner for R&D.

The company uses SAP as its primary enterprise resource planning (ERP) application, and prefers off the shelf solutions to custom application development. IT works closely with its IT service providers. HP was brought in to manage data center operations in the Americas, Asia, Africa, Turkey, and the Middle East. 

Unilever also has a contract with BT for the innovation and management of its supply chain. The company works with Accenture to implement a unified IT platform for Europe and relies on products and services from IBM and Oracle.

In order to keep costs low, the company recently implemented a Microsoft private cloud infrastructure in which it uses Windows server 2008 R2 and Windows server 2012 and virtualizes those servers using Hyper-V technology.

Estimates of the company's total IT workforce near 4,000, with as many as 3,000 of its staff members involved with IT professionals stationed in Europe.

Axe
For 33 years, we’ve helped guys look, feel and smell great, and research tells us that what makes a guy most attractive is... himself. His strengths, his weaknesses, his individuality and most of all how he expresses it. Yet, these days, many guys don’t feel comfortable being themselves. We want to change that.

Axe
For 33 years, we’ve helped guys look, feel and smell great, and research tells us that what makes a guy most attractive is... himself. His strengths, his weaknesses, his individuality and most of all how he expresses it. Yet, these days, many guys don’t feel comfortable being themselves. We want to change that.

Unilever has been in business since the 1880s. Our unique heritage shapes the way we do business today.





Helping people get more out of life




Unilever Archives




The Unilever archives are amongst the most important collections of business records in the world.



                            Unilever Archives
                        





Unilever's corporate vision – helping people to look good, feel good and get more out of life – shows how clearly the business understands 21st century-consumers and their lives. But the spirit of this mission forms a thread that runs throughout our history.In the 1890s, William Hesketh Lever, founder of Lever Bros, wrote down his ideas for Sunlight Soap – his revolutionary new product that helped popularise cleanliness and hygiene in Victorian England.It was 'to make cleanliness commonplace; to lessen work for women; to foster health and contribute to personal attractiveness, that life may be more enjoyable and rewarding for the people who use our products'.This was long before the phrase 'Corporate Mission' had been invented, but these ideas have stayed at the heart of our business. Even if their language – and the notion of only women doing housework – has become outdated.Follow our timeline to find out more about our history that now crosses three centuries.

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]
2010–2014[edit]

In March 2011 it was announced that Unilever had entered into a binding agreement to sell the Sanex brand to Colgate-Palmolive for €672 million, and that Unilever would acquire Colgate-Palmolive's laundry detergent brands in Colombia (Fab, Lavomatic and Vel) for US$215 million.[44] In April 2011 Unilever was fined €104 million by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel in Europe along with P&G, who was fined €211.2 million, and Henkel (not fined). Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Unilever's highest executive body is the Unilever Leadership Executive, which is led by the Chief Executive (currently Paul Polman).

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]

Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]

FAQs



Could you send me samples or coupons for your products?


Please contact your local Unilever careline to see if free samples or coupons are being distributed. You can find their details from our contacts page.



I wish to suggest a business proposal to you. How do I go about it?

We partner with external organisations – individuals, businesses, existing suppliers, universities or NGOs – to research and develop new products in an approach called Open Innovation.Read more here about Open Innovation and find out what we are looking for – our challenges and wants.Our company European Ventures Ltd – the European venture capital arm of Unilever – partners with entrepreneurs to develop products, new distribution channels and marketing technologies in the following areas: technologies linked to sustainability; personal care products and distribution; digital marketing; novel foods; and health and vitality. To find out more, visit Unilever Ventures where there are full details and a section on online submissions.



Does Unilever test any of its products on animals?

Our commitment to ending animal testing is under-pinned by our research since the 1980s to develop alternatives to animal tests for assessing safety. We routinely use a wide range of non-animal approaches to assess the safety of our products for consumers. We do not test our products on animals, but occasionally some ingredients we use have been tested to meet government requirements. A few governments still test our products on animals in their own laboratories, and we are working with these authorities to help them adopt non-animal approaches.Our leading-edge research has one clear purpose: to continue to develop new non-animal approaches that can guarantee our products are safe. We are making good progress in developing a non-animal approach for assessing the safety of ingredients that may cause skin allergy. Information about our research strategy and partners is available on our Safety Science in the 21st Century website. Find out more about alternative approaches to animal testing.

Unilever (/ˈjuːnᵻˌliːvər/) is a Dutch-British transnational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom. Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world's largest consumer goods company measured by 2012 revenue,.[4] Unilever is the world's largest producer of food spreads, such as margarine.[5] Unilever is one of the oldest multinational companies; its products are available in around 190 countries.[6]
Unilever owns over 400 brands, but focuses on thirteen brands with sales of over one billion[7] euros: Axe/Lynx, Dove, Omo, Becel/Flora, Heartbrand ice creams, Hellmann's, Knorr, Lipton, Lux, Magnum, Rama, Rexona, Sunsilk and Surf.[6] It is a dual-listed company consisting of Unilever N.V., based in Rotterdam, and Unilever plc, based in London. The two companies operate as a single business, with a common board of directors. Unilever is organised into four main divisions – Foods, Refreshment (beverages and ice cream), Home Care, and Personal Care. It has research and development facilities in the United Kingdom (two), the Netherlands, China, India and the United States.[8]
Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soapmaker Lever Brothers. During the second half of the 20th century the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats, and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Lipton (1971), Brooke Bond (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), Best Foods (2000), Ben & Jerry's (2000), Alberto-Culver (2010), and Dollar Shave Club (2016). Unilever divested its speciality chemicals businesses to ICI in 1997. In 2015, under leadership of Paul Polman, the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.[5]
Unilever N.V. has a primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam and is a constituent of the AEX index. Unilever plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is also a lux of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[9]

History[edit]
1870s–1910s[edit]
In 1872, Antoon Jurgens, founded the first margarine factory in the world in Oss, Netherlands. Then, in 1888, Samuel van den Bergh, also from Oss, opened his margarine factory in Kleve. These two companies merged in 1927 to form Margarine Unie.[10]
1910s–1920s[edit]




Lever House in Port Sunlight, United Kingdom, the former headquarters of Lever Brothers


The initial harvesting of palm oil was from British West Africa, from where news reports seen back in England showed the workers abroad in favourable conditions.[11] In 1911, the company received a concession for 750,000 hectares of forest in Belgian Congo, mostly south of Bandundu, where a system of forced labour operated.[12]
1920s–1930s[edit]
In 1922 Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons.[13] In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[14]
1930s–1940s[edit]
In the 1930s business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.[15] In 1943 it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][16] In 1944, Pepsodent was acquired.[16]
After 1945 Unilever's once successful US businesses (Lever Brothers and T.J. Lipton) began to decline.[1] As a result, Unilever began to operate a "hands off" policy towards the subsidiaries, and left American management to its own devices.[1]
1950s–1960s[edit]
Sunsilk was first launched in the UK in 1954.[17] Dove was first launched in the US in 1957.[17] Unilever took full ownership of Frosted Foods in 1957, which it renamed Birds Eye.[18] The US-based Good Humor ice cream business was acquired in 1961.[19]
By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.[13] However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify.[13] In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers.[13] In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.[20]
1970s–1980s[edit]
By the end of the 1970s, through acquisitions, Unilever had gained 30 per cent of the Western European ice cream market.[13] In 1982 Unilever management decided to reposition itself from an unwieldy conglomerate to a more concentrated FMCG company.[21]
In 1984 Unilever acquired Brooke Bond (maker of PG Tips tea) for £390 million in the company's first successful hostile takeover.[13] In 1986 Unilever strengthened its position in the world skin care market by acquiring Chesebrough-Ponds (merged from Chesebrough Manufacturing and Pond's Creams), the maker of Ragú, Pond's, Aqua-Net, Cutex, and Vaseline in another hostile takeover.[21] In 1989, Unilever bought Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Fabergé, and Elizabeth Arden, but the latter was later sold (in 2000) to FFI Fragrances.[22]
1990s[edit]
In 1993 Unilever acquired Breyers from Kraft, which made the company the largest ice cream manufacturer in the United States.[23]
In 1996 Unilever merged Elida Gibbs and Lever Brothers in its UK operations.[24] It also purchased Helene Curtis, significantly expanding its presence in the United States shampoo and deodorant market.[22] The purchase brought Unilever the Suave and Finesse hair-care product brands and Degree deodorant brand.[22]
In 1997 Unilever sold its speciality chemicals division, including National Starch & Chemical, Quest, Unichema and Crosfield to Imperial Chemical Industries for £4.9 billion.[25]
Unilever established a sustainable agriculture programme in 1998.[26]
2000s[edit]

In April 2000 Unilever bought both Ben & Jerry's and Slim Fast for £1.63 billion.[25] Later that year, the company acquired Best Foods for £13.4 billion.[25] The Bestfoods acquisition increased Unilever's scale in foods in America, and added brands such as Knorr and Hellmann's to its portfolio.[25] The transaction was the second largest cash acquisition in world business history.[25] In exchange for European regulatory approval of the deal, Unilever divested itself of such well-known brands as Oxo, Royco and Batchelors.[25] The same year the company bought worldwide mustard and products firm Maille. Maille had three boutiques in Europe, all of which sell mustard from the pump in the traditional Maille fashion. Paris, Dijon, France and London, UK. The merge between Best Foods and Unilever was approved by the Israeli Anti trust agency.[27]
In 2001 Unilever split into two divisions: one for Foods and one for Home and Personal Care.[25] In the UK it merged its Lever Brothers and Elida Faberge businesses as Lever Faberge in January 2001.[28]
In September 2002, the company sold its specialty oils and fats division, Loders Croklaan, for RM814 million (€218.5 million) to IOI Corporation, a Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based oil palm company. As part of the deal, the Loders Croklaan brand will be maintained.[29]
Also in 2002 Unilever sold the Mazola, Argo & Kingsfords, Karo, Golden Griddle, and Henri's brands, along with several Canadian brands, to ACH Food Companies, an American subsidiary of Associated British Foods.[30][31]
In 2004 Unilever sold its share in Rushdi food industry to the Bashir family which started to used the Baracke brand name.[32] As of 2014 Roshadi food industries was one of the three largest tahini producers in Israel and one of the largest producers of Tahini worldwide.[33]
In May 2007 Unilever became the first large-scale company to commit to sourcing all its tea in a sustainable manner,[34] employing the Rainforest Alliance, an international environmental NGO, to certify its tea estates in East Africa, as well as third-party suppliers in Africa and other parts of the world.[35] It declared its aim to have all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in Western Europe certified by 2010, followed by all Lipton tea bags globally by 2015.[36]
In September 2009 Unilever agreed to acquire the personal care business of Sara Lee Corporation, including brands such as Radox, Badedas and Duschdas, strengthening its category leadership in skin cleansing and deodorants.[37] The Sara Lee acquisition was completed on 6 December 2010.[38]

Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after Unilever and P&G admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.[45] On 24 August 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to sell the Alberto VO5 brand in the United States and Puerto Rico, and the Rave brand globally, to Brynwood Partners VI L.P.[46] On 14 October 2011 it was announced that Unilever had agreed to acquire 82% of the Russia-based beauty company Kalina.[47]

Hampton Creek lawsuit[edit]
In November 2014, Unilever was the subject of a media backlash[61] due to its lawsuit against rival Hampton Creek. In its suit,[62] Unilever revealed that Hampton Creek is "seizing market share" and the losses are causing Unilever "irreparable harm." Unilever used standard of identity regulations in claiming that Hampton Creek's "Just Mayo" products are falsely advertised because they don't contain eggs.[63]
The Washington Post[64] headline on the suit read, "Big Food's Weird War Over The Meaning of Mayonnaise." The Los Angeles Times[65] began its story with "Big Tobacco, Big Oil, now Big Mayo?" A Wall Street Journal writer described that with "Giant corporation generates huge quantities of free advertising and brand equity for tiny rival by suing it."[66]
Eat Drink Politics headlined the controversy with "Unilever's Bullying Backfires, Boosts Hampton Creek". Negative media coverage of Big Mayo lawsuit goes viral in case study of PR blunder".[61]
2015–present[edit]
In March 2015, Unilever confirmed it had reached an agreement to acquire REN Skincare, a British niche skincare brand.[67] This was followed in May 2015 by the acquisition of prestige skincare brand Kate Somerville Skincare LLC.[68]
In July 2015, the company separated its spreads business,[69] including its Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! brands, into a standalone entity named Unilever Baking, Cooking and Spreading.[70] The separation was first announced in December 2014 and was made in response to declining worldwide sales in that product category.[71]
In October 2015, Unilever agreed to acquire the Italian premium ice cream maker GROM for an undisclosed fee.[72]
In July 2016, Unilever bought the US start-up Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1bn (£764m) in cash to compete in the male grooming market.[73]
In September Unilever acquired Seventh Generation Inc. for $700 million.[74]
On February 17, 2017, significantly smaller Kraft Heinz made a $143 billion bid for food and consumer products giant Unilever[75][76] The deal was declined by Unilever and further abandoned on February 19 when UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[77]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Legal structure[edit]




100 Victoria Embankment, Unilever House in London, United Kingdom


Unilever has two holding companies: Unilever N.V., which has its registered and head office in Rotterdam, Netherlands and Unilever plc, which has its registered office at Port Sunlight in Merseyside, United Kingdom and its head office at Unilever House in London, United Kingdom.[85] Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. and their subsidiary companies operate as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, whilst remaining separate legal entities with different shareholders and separate stock exchange listings.[85]
There are a series of legal agreements between the parent companies, together with special provisions in their respective Articles of Association, which are known as the Foundation Agreements.[85] A key requirement of the agreements is that the same people be on the Boards of the two parent companies. An Equalisation Agreement regulates the mutual rights of shareholders in Unilever plc and Unilever N.V. with the objective of ensuring that, in principle, it does not make any financial difference to hold shares in Unilever plc rather than Unilever N.V. (and vice versa).[85]

Logo[edit]
In 1930, the logo of Unilever used the Helvetica font in all caps. In 1969, the typeface of the logo was changed, but the basic design remained the same. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by Wolff Olins, a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.[86] The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."[87]
Advertising[edit]
Dove: Dove describes itself as being dedicated to "help ... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential". (Dove, "Our Vision")[88] Dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign, focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007 this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly, and that women's ageing process was something to be ashamed of.[89]
Lynx/Axe: Axe, known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of 16 and 24.[90] Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products.[91][92] Unlike Dove's long running beauty campaign Lynx advertising often creates mini series' of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. This advertising campaign thrives on controversy. Using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012 Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. This advert designed for television, shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls. In 2011 in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned. The poster for Lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach, with the headline: "The cleaner you are the dirtier you get."[91][93]
Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual, flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men, of all ages and stature, for their use of the Lynx product. Their target audience are men between the ages of 16-24 who are single.[90]
Environmental record[edit]
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by: halving the environmental footprint of its products over the next 10 years; helping 1 billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.[94]
Palm oil[edit]
Unilever has been criticised by Greenpeace for causing deforestation,[95] Unilever was targeted in 2008 by Greenpeace UK,[96] which criticised the company for buying palm oil from suppliers that are damaging Indonesia's rainforests.[97] By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country. The United Nations Environmental Programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia.[97]
Furthermore, Indonesia was the fourteenth[98] largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.[99] According to Greenpeace, palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.[99] Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.[99]
Unilever, as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.[100] It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.[101]
In Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a primate species, Miss Waldron's red colobus. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.[102]
According to Amnesty International in 2016 Unilever palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14 year old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemical. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was world’s biggest palm oil grower.[103]
Paper use[edit]
For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third largest paper producer in the world, which was labelled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.[104] In 2011, when Unilever cancelled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended the company for efforts made towards forest protection, for "taking rainforest conservation seriously."[105]
Rainforest Alliance[edit]
Unilever certifies its tea products by the Rainforest Alliance scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over Fairtrade, because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".[106]
Criticism[edit]
Main article: Rainforest Alliance § Criticism and response
The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,[107] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. The alternative certificate, Fairtrade, has however received similar criticism as well. The Rainforest Alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.[108]
July - September 2016 Salmonella affair[edit]
Salmonella affair in cereals in Israel[edit]
In July 2016, rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among Israeli consumers.[109] Initially, Unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a non-story and nonsense. On the night of 26 July 2016, Unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains.[110] On 28 July, Yediot Ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed.[111] By 28 July, despite the company's assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption, many customers stopped buying Unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by Unilever.[112] The company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates.[113]
On 2 August 2016, Globes reported that the company has published more information about Telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a Telma announcement had been made: "We again stress that all Telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat. According to our company's strict procedures, every production batch is checked and put on hold. These products are not marketed until test results for this production series are returned, confirming that all is well. If any flaw is discovered, the batch is not marketed to stores, as was the case."[114] In the following days the Health Minister, Yakov Litzman, threatened to pull Unilever's licence in Israel. He accused Unilever of lying to his ministry regarding salmonella-infected breakfast cereals.[115]
On 7 August, Globes reported that contamination may be sourced in pigeon faeces, the Health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source. Globes also said that the production line is automatic ("without human hands") and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance.[116] On 8 August 2016, the Israeli Health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until Unilever carry out a number of corrections; the action came after an inspection of the Arad plant, stating "This was a series of negligent mistakes, and not an incident with malicious intent by the firm's management and quality control procedures."[117] An investigation led by Prof. Itamr Grutto and Eli Gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence.[118]
On 23 September it was reported that the cereals produced between the 18th and 20th at the Arad plant had traces of salmonella.[119]
Class actions[edit]
A filed class action must first be approved by an Israeli court, after an approval the case will be held.

For a sum of 1.2 million NIS (~$329K USD) against Unilever for hiding the contamination and misleading the public[120]
For a sum of 76 million NIS (~$23m USD) against Unilever after a 15-year-old teen had been hospitalised for Salmonellosis after allegedly contracting it from Unilever products[121]

Salmonella affair in Tehnia[edit]
On 31 August, Unilever stated that the Tehnia products produced by RJM had been contaminated by Salmonella.[122]
Kodaikanal[edit]
In 2015, Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf released the music video "Kodaikanal Won't," set to the beat of Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," to criticise Unilever for dumping mercury into waste ground at the Indian town of Kodaikanal.[123][124] Unilever acknowledges it took on a thermometer factory there through the acquisition of Chesebrough-Ponds. According to Unilever's statement, the factory had sold mercury-contaminated scrap glass to a local dealer, prompting Hindustan Unilever to immediately close the factory, plan the clean-up of the affected sites and monitor the health of its workers. Unilever's website states that it has been waiting since 2010 for the local government Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to give it permission for the clean-up.[125]
