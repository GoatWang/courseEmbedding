              Home security with smart AI.
            


              False alerts are practically a “feature” on home security cameras
              because their ordinary sensors get tricked by pets, headlights and
              moving shadows. Lighthouse camera's AI monitoring eliminates false alerts using a 3D sensor
              and machine learning, so it only notifies you when it
              detects actual movement triggered by a person it doesn’t recognize.
              Hit the siren or call the police, right from the alert.

              Need to know?  Just ask.
            


              Want to know “What did the kids do with the babysitter?”
              or “What did the dog do after I left?”  Instead of scrubbing
              through hours of boring home security camera footage or watching live view all day, all you
              have to do is ask, and the right moments appear instantly.
              It's not actually magic, but your friends will think it is.

              Tell Lighthouse what you care about.
            


              Simply ask
              "Ping me if the kids don't come home by 4pm on weekdays" or "Let me know when you
              see John with the dog while I'm out."  Or maybe just "Tell me when you see the
              cat jumping in the kitchen."  It's so much better than being alerted “something
              moved” for the umpteenth time.

            "Lighthouse has integrated computer vision technology into a device
            allowing it to identify the difference between people, pets, etc.,
            which eliminates false alarms. Add in the ability to set custom
            notifications and search through your recordings and it is unique to the market."

            "Initially, I thought Lighthouse was just a next-gen security system,
            but after using it, it has become apparent that it’s much more.
            I can customize it to ping me about events I specifically care
            about at home. Not only does this give continuous assurance,
            it also simplifies my life."

I love them for many reasons - they do a great job at classifying and alerting me when appropriate, and I am super impressed with how quick feeds load and how clear and crisp they are. The overall design is also beautiful, and it is easy to find a spot for it."

            True Alerts
          


              Since Lighthouse only triggers on 3D movement
              and understands what it's looking at, you'll only
              receive security alerts when there's actually a person that warrants your attention. You’ll see a snapshot
              right on your phone’s lock screen, so you can decide if immediate action is required.
              And Lighthouse automatically enables and disables alerts based on
              whether you're home, so you, your family and trusted guests can
              come and go without triggering unwanted alerts.
              No more 4-digit access codes.
            




                Person recognition
          


              Using facial recognition, Lighthouse learns your household's members and guests,
              so you know instantly who's coming and going, and if someone new arrives on the scene.
            




                Live stream
          


              See your home live in beautiful 1080p, with support for portrait and landscape modes.
            




                Emergency activation
          


              When you’re alerted to a possible security threat, you can sound a
              siren, speak through the camera or call the police—right from the app.
            




                Night vision
          


              With high quality night vision, Lighthouse keeps watch even
              after the lights go down.
            




                Fine-grained access control
          


              Invite family members and guests to your home, and
              control permissions for viewing video and receiving notifications.

                Voice and text search
          


              When it comes to home, you’re always on a need-to-know basis.
              With the Lighthouse app, all you have to do is ask.
              Instead of scrubbing through hours of video, you can just ask. Some examples:
              

 "What did the kids do while I was out yesterday?"
              
 "Has the cat done anything interesting since I left?"
              
 "Who did you see at the front door on Tuesday between 8 and 10am?"
              
 "Have you seen the kids running around recently?"
              
 "Did you see Chris with the dog at the front door last week while I was away?"
              

              And if you’re the quiet type, you can instead type a brief search -
              just like you're Googling your home.

            




                HaloVision
          


              Any time you go back and review recorded video, color-coded halos
              make it easy to follow and sort out activity around adults,
              children and pets. And they’re just so cool.

                Pings
          


              Ask Lighthouse to ping you the moment something important happens - or doesn't happen.  Five seconds to set up, endless peace of mind.

              
 "If you don't see the kids by 4pm on weekdays while I'm away, let me know."
                
 "Tell me if you see the kids alone in the garage."
                
 "Send me a ping when John gets home today."
                
 "Ping me if Dana doesn't arrive on Saturdays between 10 and 11am."
                
 "Notify me if you see the kids downstairs between 10pm and 6am."
                
 "When the cat jumps on the kitchen table, send me a notification."
                
 "Alert me if you don't see someone with the dog at the front door between 12 and 2pm when I'm out."
                 "Let me know if no one enters the kitchen between 4pm and 8pm."
                






            Rich notifications
          


              Know exactly what’s going on, without even opening the app.
              Get a preview of security alerts and pings, right from your phone’s lock screen.
            




                Activity feed
          


              See the day’s important events, such as how long someone’s been home, who’s been coming and going,
              the camera being armed and disarmed, and security alerts, all in one place.
            




                All systems go
          


            With the tri-color LED indicator on the camera or a quick check of
            the app, you can instantly check that Lighthouse is online,
            recording and streaming.

            Wave hello
          


              Since Lighthouse is smart enough to recognize a friendly wave,
              family members can say hello when you’re away just by waving to
              the camera. So enjoy the hug away from home or use the mic to chat
              and check in live.
            




                Two-way talk
          


              Listen and speak to family members and guests — of both the two
              and four-legged variety — using the built-in speaker and microphone.
              For added privacy and control, you can turn audio on and off whenever you’d like.

      Lighthouse: About us
    



























          01_Our_Vision
        


        Building the future of our dreams.
      

        There’s nothing like the feeling of knowing when you’re part of
        something new. Something exciting. And something meaningful. We live in
        a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial
        intelligence, computer vision, deep learning and natural language
        processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and
        everyday lives. And for us, one of the most interesting possibilities
        is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most: our home.
      





          02_Our_Story
        


        The start of something big.
      

        Lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of Stanford,
        where our CTO and Co-founder Hendrik Dahlkamp worked on Stanley,
        Stanford’s pioneering self-driving car. After being on the first team to
        ever win the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles, Hendrik
        continued his work in Sebastian Thrun’s lab, where he met our CEO and
        Co-founder Alex Teichman, an expert in semi-supervised learning on
        3D sensors. The two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled
        advancements in computer vision and depth perception.  Alex and Hendrik
        saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative
        ways, and Lighthouse was born.

        Our founders.
      








          Alex Teichman — CEO and Co-founder
        



            While receiving his PhD in computer science, Alex led Stanford’s research
            on self-driving car perception, inventing machine learning techniques that
            enabled self-driving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead
            of requiring large-scale human annotation. Intrigued by the
            potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial
            intelligence, he was inspired to leverage these new technologies
            for real-world applications in the home. Alex has an undergrad degree
            in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, and a
            PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University.
        










          Hendrik Dahlkamp — CTO and Co-founder
        



            Hendrik previously co-founded two companies, both acquired by Google.
            His work led to the creation of Google Street View, Google Maps’
            turn-by-turn directions and gesture recognition that was
            incorporated into Android’s technology. He is a DARPA Grand
            Challenge winner for Stanley, the first self-driving car, and was
            the first engineer at Google X. Hendrik has a BS in Computer
            Science and Math and an MS in Computer Science from
            Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. He left
            Stanford University’s PhD program to become an entrepreneur.

      Lighthouse: Technology
    




















              Seriously state of the art.
            

              Through our founders' PhD work on self-driving cars at Stanford -
              where they built Stanley, the first autonomous car to complete
              the 132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge race - it became clear that
              combining cameras with 3D sensors would enable extraordinary
              computer vision capabilities. For the first time we’re
              bringing that technology into the home, so Lighthouse sees
              and understands your world as you do.
            








              3D makes the extraordinary possible.
            

              Lighthouse has a custom optical module featuring the first-ever
              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after
              bouncing off objects in the environment, producing a
              continuously updating 3D model of the scene - fundamental to the advanced
              computer vision that makes the Lighthouse experience possible.

              3D makes the extraordinary possible.
            

              Lighthouse has a custom optical module featuring the first-ever
              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after

                  3D MAPPING
                





                  False alerts, gone forever. Really.
                

                  Because Lighthouse directly measures the full 3D structure of the environment, we’ve eliminated the
                  false alerts from changing light conditions and shadows that plague
                  all other home cameras.
                












                  DEEP LEARNING
                





                  Always (machine) learning.
                

                  We’ve spent over two years building machine learning models that can
                  accurately classify dogs, cats, children and adults, and ignore movement
                  from objects like curtains or fans. 3D sensing makes it possible to
                  understand the motion of objects through space and time,
                  enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale
                  quantitative testing.
                












                  PERSON RECOGNITION
                





                  Next-level person identification.
                

                  Our team of computer vision PhDs have built models that allow
                  Lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown
                  faces.  And 3D sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that
                  identify a known person by size, shape or movement, even when it
                  can’t see a face.
                












                  ACTION RECOGNITION
                





                  Action recognition beyond simple gestures.
                

                  Using action recognition models trained on the 3D sensor,
                  we’re able to distinguish and alert you to interesting
                  activity in your home, like your dog jumping on the counter,
                  kids running around or a loved one waving hello.
                














            All spec’d out.

              Home security with smart AI.
            


              False alerts are practically a “feature” on home security cameras
              because their ordinary sensors get tricked by pets, headlights and
              moving shadows. Lighthouse camera's AI monitoring eliminates false alerts using a 3D sensor
              and machine learning, so it only notifies you when it
              detects actual movement triggered by a person it doesn’t recognize.
              Hit the siren or call the police, right from the alert.

              Need to know?  Just ask.
            


              Want to know “What did the kids do with the babysitter?”
              or “What did the dog do after I left?”  Instead of scrubbing
              through hours of boring home security camera footage or watching live view all day, all you
              have to do is ask, and the right moments appear instantly.
              It's not actually magic, but your friends will think it is.

              Tell Lighthouse what you care about.
            


              Simply ask
              "Ping me if the kids don't come home by 4pm on weekdays" or "Let me know when you
              see John with the dog while I'm out."  Or maybe just "Tell me when you see the
              cat jumping in the kitchen."  It's so much better than being alerted “something
              moved” for the umpteenth time.

            "Lighthouse has integrated computer vision technology into a device
            allowing it to identify the difference between people, pets, etc.,
            which eliminates false alarms. Add in the ability to set custom
            notifications and search through your recordings and it is unique to the market."

            "Initially, I thought Lighthouse was just a next-gen security system,
            but after using it, it has become apparent that it’s much more.
            I can customize it to ping me about events I specifically care
            about at home. Not only does this give continuous assurance,
            it also simplifies my life."

I love them for many reasons - they do a great job at classifying and alerting me when appropriate, and I am super impressed with how quick feeds load and how clear and crisp they are. The overall design is also beautiful, and it is easy to find a spot for it."

            True Alerts
          


              Since Lighthouse only triggers on 3D movement
              and understands what it's looking at, you'll only
              receive security alerts when there's actually a person that warrants your attention. You’ll see a snapshot
              right on your phone’s lock screen, so you can decide if immediate action is required.
              And Lighthouse automatically enables and disables alerts based on
              whether you're home, so you, your family and trusted guests can
              come and go without triggering unwanted alerts.
              No more 4-digit access codes.
            




                Person recognition
          


              Using facial recognition, Lighthouse learns your household's members and guests,
              so you know instantly who's coming and going, and if someone new arrives on the scene.
            




                Live stream
          


              See your home live in beautiful 1080p, with support for portrait and landscape modes.
            




                Emergency activation
          


              When you’re alerted to a possible security threat, you can sound a
              siren, speak through the camera or call the police—right from the app.
            




                Night vision
          


              With high quality night vision, Lighthouse keeps watch even
              after the lights go down.
            




                Fine-grained access control
          


              Invite family members and guests to your home, and
              control permissions for viewing video and receiving notifications.

                Voice and text search
          


              When it comes to home, you’re always on a need-to-know basis.
              With the Lighthouse app, all you have to do is ask.
              Instead of scrubbing through hours of video, you can just ask. Some examples:
              

 "What did the kids do while I was out yesterday?"
              
 "Has the cat done anything interesting since I left?"
              
 "Who did you see at the front door on Tuesday between 8 and 10am?"
              
 "Have you seen the kids running around recently?"
              
 "Did you see Chris with the dog at the front door last week while I was away?"
              

              And if you’re the quiet type, you can instead type a brief search -
              just like you're Googling your home.

            




                HaloVision
          


              Any time you go back and review recorded video, color-coded halos
              make it easy to follow and sort out activity around adults,
              children and pets. And they’re just so cool.

                Pings
          


              Ask Lighthouse to ping you the moment something important happens - or doesn't happen.  Five seconds to set up, endless peace of mind.

              
 "If you don't see the kids by 4pm on weekdays while I'm away, let me know."
                
 "Tell me if you see the kids alone in the garage."
                
 "Send me a ping when John gets home today."
                
 "Ping me if Dana doesn't arrive on Saturdays between 10 and 11am."
                
 "Notify me if you see the kids downstairs between 10pm and 6am."
                
 "When the cat jumps on the kitchen table, send me a notification."
                
 "Alert me if you don't see someone with the dog at the front door between 12 and 2pm when I'm out."
                 "Let me know if no one enters the kitchen between 4pm and 8pm."
                






            Rich notifications
          


              Know exactly what’s going on, without even opening the app.
              Get a preview of security alerts and pings, right from your phone’s lock screen.
            




                Activity feed
          


              See the day’s important events, such as how long someone’s been home, who’s been coming and going,
              the camera being armed and disarmed, and security alerts, all in one place.
            




                All systems go
          


            With the tri-color LED indicator on the camera or a quick check of
            the app, you can instantly check that Lighthouse is online,
            recording and streaming.

            Wave hello
          


              Since Lighthouse is smart enough to recognize a friendly wave,
              family members can say hello when you’re away just by waving to
              the camera. So enjoy the hug away from home or use the mic to chat
              and check in live.
            




                Two-way talk
          


              Listen and speak to family members and guests — of both the two
              and four-legged variety — using the built-in speaker and microphone.
              For added privacy and control, you can turn audio on and off whenever you’d like.

      Lighthouse: Technology
    




















              Seriously state of the art.
            

              Through our founders' PhD work on self-driving cars at Stanford -
              where they built Stanley, the first autonomous car to complete
              the 132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge race - it became clear that
              combining cameras with 3D sensors would enable extraordinary
              computer vision capabilities. For the first time we’re
              bringing that technology into the home, so Lighthouse sees
              and understands your world as you do.
            








              3D makes the extraordinary possible.
            

              Lighthouse has a custom optical module featuring the first-ever
              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after
              bouncing off objects in the environment, producing a
              continuously updating 3D model of the scene - fundamental to the advanced
              computer vision that makes the Lighthouse experience possible.

              3D makes the extraordinary possible.

              3D time-of-flight sensor on a home awareness device. This sensor measures the
              time it takes for emitted light to return to Lighthouse after

                  3D MAPPING
                





                  False alerts, gone forever. Really.
                

                  Because Lighthouse directly measures the full 3D structure of the environment, we’ve eliminated the
                  false alerts from changing light conditions and shadows that plague
                  all other home cameras.
                












                  DEEP LEARNING
                





                  Always (machine) learning.
                

                  We’ve spent over two years building machine learning models that can
                  accurately classify dogs, cats, children and adults, and ignore movement
                  from objects like curtains or fans. 3D sensing makes it possible to
                  understand the motion of objects through space and time,
                  enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale
                  quantitative testing.
                












                  PERSON RECOGNITION
                





                  Next-level person identification.
                

                  Our team of computer vision PhDs have built models that allow
                  Lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown
                  faces.  And 3D sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that
                  identify a known person by size, shape or movement, even when it
                  can’t see a face.
                












                  ACTION RECOGNITION
                





                  Action recognition beyond simple gestures.
                

                  Using action recognition models trained on the 3D sensor,
                  we’re able to distinguish and alert you to interesting
                  activity in your home, like your dog jumping on the counter,
                  kids running around or a loved one waving hello.
                














            All spec’d out.

      Lighthouse: About us
    



























          01_Our_Vision
        


        Building the future of our dreams.
      

        There’s nothing like the feeling of knowing when you’re part of
        something new. Something exciting. And something meaningful. We live in
        a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial
        intelligence, computer vision, deep learning and natural language
        processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and
        everyday lives. And for us, one of the most interesting possibilities
        is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most: our home.
      





          02_Our_Story
        


        The start of something big.
      

        Lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of Stanford,
        where our CTO and Co-founder Hendrik Dahlkamp worked on Stanley,
        Stanford’s pioneering self-driving car. After being on the first team to
        ever win the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles, Hendrik
        continued his work in Sebastian Thrun’s lab, where he met our CEO and
        Co-founder Alex Teichman, an expert in semi-supervised learning on
        3D sensors. The two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled
        advancements in computer vision and depth perception.  Alex and Hendrik
        saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative
        ways, and Lighthouse was born.

        Our founders.
      








          Alex Teichman — CEO and Co-founder
        



            While receiving his PhD in computer science, Alex led Stanford’s research
            on self-driving car perception, inventing machine learning techniques that
            enabled self-driving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead
            of requiring large-scale human annotation. Intrigued by the
            potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial
            intelligence, he was inspired to leverage these new technologies
            for real-world applications in the home. Alex has an undergrad degree
            in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, and a
            PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University.
        










          Hendrik Dahlkamp — CTO and Co-founder
        



            Hendrik previously co-founded two companies, both acquired by Google.
            His work led to the creation of Google Street View, Google Maps’
            turn-by-turn directions and gesture recognition that was
            incorporated into Android’s technology. He is a DARPA Grand
            Challenge winner for Stanley, the first self-driving car, and was
            the first engineer at Google X. Hendrik has a BS in Computer
            Science and Math and an MS in Computer Science from
            Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. He left
            Stanford University’s PhD program to become an entrepreneur.
