Carey Credit Income Fund (CCIF) is a non-traded business development company (BDC)

                What Is Carey Credit Income Fund?
            
CCIF's current offering, Carey Credit Income Fund – I (CCIF – I), is a feeder fund in a master/feeder structure that is designed to provide its investors with: 


Current Income
Capital Preservation
Capital Appreciation, to a lesser extent



                        There is no guarantee these objectives and goals will be achieved.
                    









                HOW DOES CCIF CREATE VALUE FOR ITS INVESTORS?
            
CCIF intends to invest primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies, focusing on senior secured debt investments.
CCIF seeks to provide value for the investors of its feeder funds through its experienced management team and disciplined investment strategy that seeks to capitalize on the supply/demand imbalances in the market.






Management
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC, parent companies of the Advisors to CCIF, have a 50+ year aggregate track record, and both play an active role in sourcing, evaluating and monitoring portfolio investments.






Alignment
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC have made an initial commitment of $50 million in CCIF, effectively aligning their interests with those of the feeder fund shareholders.1






Opportunity
U.S. middle market companies are continuously looking for capital to invest into their businesses. CCIF seeks to capitalize on the shortage in supply of financing from traditional lenders by providing loans to these companies.2




1The Sub-Advisor’s alignment of interest today is maintained by Guggenheim Partners, LLC, the parent company of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management LLC, the Sub-Advisor.
2CCIF seeks to primarily invest in the senior secured debt of private middle market American companies.

Investing in privately held middle market companies involves a number of risks including reduced access to capital, diminished ability to
withstand financial distress and limited liquidity.







 HOW WILL CCIF GUIDE INVESTORS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR INCOME?
CCIF is the master fund, which pools investor capital raised through its feeder funds—such as the current fund offering, CCIF – I. Both master and feeder share the same investment objectives and strategies. All portfolio investments are made by Carey Credit Income Fund, the master fund.


 

 Investors can only acquire shares in a feeder fund, which invests substantially all of its assets in the common shares of CCIF at net asset value, which will vary over time. CCIF, the master fund, and the feeder funds share the same investment objectives and strategies. The imposition of fees and expenses may affect a non-traded BDC’s ability to generate income.

1CCIF 2016 T’s Board of Trustees must consider a liquidity event on or before December 31, 2021; however, the Board of Trustees could delay pursuing a liquidity event for at most an additional one year period if it determines that it would not be in the best interests of shareholders to pursue a liquidity event at that time due to adverse market conditions.
2CCIF 2016 T is designed to be a long-term investment. However, investors may be able to submit their shares for repurchase at NAV. In any calendar year, share repurchase may be no more than 10% of the weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 12-month period. There is no assurance that the Board of Trustees will exercise its discretion to offer to repurchase shares or that there will be sufficient funds available to accommodate all of the shareholders' requests for repurchase. The share repurchase program may be amended, suspended or terminated at any time.
3The payment of future distributions on the common stock of CCIF 2016 T is subject to the discretion of the board of trustees and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. Distributions are not guaranteed.

Annualized Distribution Rate ±

 


The annualized distribution rate is calculated by dividing the annualized distributions by the net asset value for CCIF 2016 T. Regular cash distributions do not include declared special cash or share distributions, if any. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on the common stock of CCIF 2016 T is subject to the discretion of the board of trustees and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. Distributions are not guaranteed. Future distributions to shareholders of CCIF 2016 T may be funded in significant part by the reimbursement of certain expenses that are subject to repayment to the advisors of CCIF 2016 T. Such waivers and reimbursements by the advisors may not continue in the future. If the advisors had not agreed to reimburse certain expenses for CCIF 2016 T, significant portions of the distributions paid thus far may have come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of amounts owed to the advisors will reduce the future distributions to which investors would otherwise be entitled.
Cumulative total return for CCIF 2016 T from October 8, 2015 to March 31, 2017 is 13.34% (without upfront sales load) and 6.83% (with upfront sales load). An investment in CCIF 2016 T is subject to a maximum upfront sales load of 5.75% of the offering price, which will reduce the amount of capital available for investment.  Cumulative total return includes all operating expenses such as management fees, recurring general and administrative expenses, organization and amortized offering expenses, and interest expenses, including CCIF 2016 T’s proportionate share of the master fund’s expenses. Operating expenses may vary in the future based on the Advisors’ election to continue expense support, the future occurrence of distribution and shareholder servicing fees and other unpredictable variables. Over the presentation period, the combination of the total operating expenses, including the master fund and CCIF 2016 T, were 16.35% and 10.74% of the fund’s average net value since inception, before and after expense support provided by the Advisors, respectively. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

An investment in CCIF 2016 T is subject to a maximum upfront sales load of 5.75% of the offering price, which will reduce the amount of capital available for investment.  Cumulative total return includes all operating expenses such as management fees, recurring general and administrative expenses, organization and amortized offering expenses, and interest expenses, including CCIF 2016 T’s proportionate share of the master fund’s expenses. Operating expenses may vary in the future based on the Advisors’ election to continue expense support, the future occurrence of distribution and shareholder servicing fees and other unpredictable variables. Over the presentation period, the combination of the total operating expenses, including the master fund and CCIF 2016 T, were 16.35% and 10.74% of the fund’s average net value since inception, before and after expense support provided by the Advisors, respectively. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.












Portfolio Overview
            
As of March 31, 2017, CCIF’s portfolio consisted of 61 companies in 24 U.S. states across 19 industries.

                Carey CreditIncome Fund
            
Carey Credit Income Fund (CCIF) is a non-traded business development company (BDC) 
managed by affiliates of W. P. Carey and Guggenheim Partners, LLC that seeks to provide 
investors of its feeder funds with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, 
capital appreciation.

                What Is Carey Credit Income Fund?
            
CCIF's current offering, Carey Credit Income Fund – I (CCIF – I), is a feeder fund in a master/feeder structure that is designed to provide its investors with: 


Current Income
Capital Preservation
Capital Appreciation, to a lesser extent



                        There is no guarantee these objectives and goals will be achieved.
                    









                HOW DOES CCIF CREATE VALUE FOR ITS INVESTORS?
            
CCIF intends to invest primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies, focusing on senior secured debt investments.
CCIF seeks to provide value for the investors of its feeder funds through its experienced management team and disciplined investment strategy that seeks to capitalize on the supply/demand imbalances in the market.






Management
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC, parent companies of the Advisors to CCIF, have a 50+ year aggregate track record, and both play an active role in sourcing, evaluating and monitoring portfolio investments.






Alignment
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC have made an initial commitment of $50 million in CCIF, effectively aligning their interests with those of the feeder fund shareholders.1






Opportunity
U.S. middle market companies are continuously looking for capital to invest into their businesses. CCIF seeks to capitalize on the shortage in supply of financing from traditional lenders by providing loans to these companies.2




1The Sub-Advisor’s alignment of interest today is maintained by Guggenheim Partners, LLC, the parent company of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management LLC, the Sub-Advisor.
2CCIF seeks to primarily invest in the senior secured debt of private middle market American companies.

Investing in privately held middle market companies involves a number of risks including reduced access to capital, diminished ability to
withstand financial distress and limited liquidity.







 HOW WILL CCIF GUIDE INVESTORS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR INCOME?
CCIF is the master fund, which pools investor capital raised through its feeder funds—such as the current fund offering, CCIF – I. Both master and feeder share the same investment objectives and strategies. All portfolio investments are made by Carey Credit Income Fund, the master fund.


 

 Investors can only acquire shares in a feeder fund, which invests substantially all of its assets in the common shares of CCIF at net asset value, which will vary over time. CCIF, the master fund, and the feeder funds share the same investment objectives and strategies. The imposition of fees and expenses may affect a non-traded BDC’s ability to generate income.







                ExperiencedManagement Team
            
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC have a 50+ year aggregate investment track record. Both firms have a shared commitment to protecting shareholders’ wealth.



 


 W. P. Carey Inc. is a publicly traded REIT that provides long-term sale-leaseback and build-to-suit financing for companies worldwide.  Its portfolio of global real estate has an enterprise value of $10.7 billion. In addition, W. P. Carey manages a series of investment programs with approximately $13.0 billion in AUM.1

1As of March 31, 2017.
2 Assets under management are as of March 31, 2017. Guggenheim Partners, LLC assets include consulting services for clients whose assets are valued at approximately $59 billion.

NEW YORK, July 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners announced today that Carey Credit Income Fund (CCIF) will begin to raise capital through its initial feeder fund, Carey Credit Income Fund 2016 T (CCIF 2016 T). CCIF is a non-traded business development company that intends to invest primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies, with a focus on senior secured debt investments. CCIF is advised by Carey Credit Advisors, LLC, an affiliate of W. P. Carey, as the advisor, and Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC, an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, as the sub-advisor.
On July 24, 2015, the registration statement for CCIF 2016 T, a non-traded feeder fund, was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. CCIF 2016 T intends to raise a maximum of $1.0 billion at an initial public offering price of $9.55 per share. 
Trevor P. Bond, Chief Executive Officer of W. P. Carey, said: "Since its founding in 1973, W. P. Carey's core business has focused on credit underwriting, providing sale-leaseback financing to growing companies. Carey Credit Income Fund is a natural extension of that competency. We believe that the partnership between W. P. Carey and Guggenheim will combine the collective expertise and provide the required know-how to successfully manage Carey Credit Income Fund while delivering a dependable income stream to its shareholders. We also believe that W. P. Carey and Guggenheim's combined $50 million initial capital investment in Carey Credit Income Fund demonstrates our commitment to the market and our fellow shareholders." 
"Carey Credit Income Fund allows individual investors the opportunity to invest in an asset class that has traditionally been available only to large institutional investors," said Jeffrey Abrams, Senior Managing Director of Guggenheim. "We look forward to a successful, long-term partnership with W. P. Carey, and we believe both the current and long-term market environment present attractive investment opportunities for Carey Credit Income Fund."

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Dividends Taken in Cash
Dividend Reinvested














Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

For Class A Shares, this chart tracks the total returns since the fund's inception date (Thursday, August 14, 1986) through December 31, 2016.  Fund returns and, if available, index returns are for calendar years except for the inception year (1986), which may not be a full calendar year. In cases where the index was launched after the fund inception, the index returns are shown in calender years.

Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Returns with sales charge for Class A shares reflect payment of the -32768.00% maximum sales charge.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement
  .



Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.

Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Returns with sales charge for Class A shares reflect payment of the -32768.00% maximum sales charge.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.
