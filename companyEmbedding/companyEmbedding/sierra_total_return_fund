PICTURE ABOVE IS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY








STRF provides investors access to both public and private securities at all levels of the capital structure with varying correlation to equity and other markets.







Sierra Total Return Fund is a newly formed entity and has a limited operating history.

The material in this Website does not constitute an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein. Such an offering is made only by means of a prospectus. The prospectus must be read in order to understand fully all the implications and risks of any offering of securities to which it relates. 

Investing in Sierra Total Return Fund (the “Fund”) involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective depends, in part, on the ability of the Advisor to effectively allocate the assets of the Fund among the various securities and investments in which the Fund invests. There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the Fund’s investment objective or delivering positive returns. The Fund will concentrate its investments in debt and equity fixed income and its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the debt/credit markets. 
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Sierra Total Return Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting www.sierratotalreturnfund.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. 

STRF’s investment objective is to seek total return through a combination of current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of debt securities and equities.

There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. To provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase its outstanding shares at net asset value. Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The Fund’s investments may be negatively affected by the broad investment environment and capital markets in which the Fund invests, including the real estate market, the debt market and/or the equity securities market. The value of the Fund’s investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices of the investments it holds. This will cause the value of the Fund’s shares to increase or decrease. The Fund is “non-diversified” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 since changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause a greater fluctuation in the Fund’s net asset value than in a “diversified” fund. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program.net asset value than in a “diversified” fund. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program. 

Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any securities exchange, which makes them inherently illiquid. Regardless of how the Fund performs, an investor may not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate his or her shares whenever such investor would prefer and may be unable to reduce his or her exposure on any market downturn. The Fund may pay distributions in significant part from sources that may not be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance, such as offering proceeds and borrowings.

 ABOUT INTERVAL FUNDS
In today’s ever-changing markets, many investors are demanding more sophisticated investment choices.  Rather than sticking to traditional mutual fund opportunities, everyday investors are looking to a new approach that combines what we believe are the best attributes of both open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds. Here’s what you should know about interval funds and why they’re quickly gaining popularity:

Perhaps the biggest advantage of an interval fund is that it can invest in both public and private securities. Exposure to private companies and institutional products can help create a well-balanced portfolio with benefits including the potential for:








Greater Yield
Reduced Volatility
Lower Correlation to Equities


 

In summary, interval funds are possibly best described as a middle ground between open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds and, as illustrated below, interval funds share attractive attributes of both.











MARKET OPPORTUNITY







BANK CONSOLIDATION
Bank consolidation has created a compelling yield premium for non-bank lenders:
There are approximately 4,700a fewer domestic banks today than there were 20 years ago
The participation rate of the remaining banks has been reduced from ~70% to less than 10%a

LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT
Middle Market loans can provide a meaningful opportunity regardless of interest rate movement:
Attractive yield in a low rate environment
Improved income potential from rising rates over time

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Sierra Total Return Fund seeks to provide attractive risk-adjusted income and returns. It expects to achieve these investment objectives through a disciplined and balanced allocation among four distinct asset strategies. Through these strategies, Sierra Total Return Fund can access both public and private securities at all levels of the capital structure with varying correlation to equity and other markets.








Public and Private Credit5


Corporate loans and bonds
Secured and unsecured 








Public Investment Opportunities6


Business development companies (“BDCs”) and mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Closed-end funds and other income equities










Private Investment Opportunities7


Credit opportunities
Real estate opportunities








Pooled Credit8


Debt and equity of Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)
Real estate backed debt and securities






Sierra Total Return Fund has the flexibility to invest across varying asset strategies and create the potential for a balance between current income, liquidity and capital appreciation.









FUND OVERVIEW

Click here for the Prospectus

Sierra Total Return Fund is new and has a limited operating history.
1) Medley Management Inc. is the parent company of Medley LLC and several registered investment advisors (collectively, “Medley”). Assets under management refers to assets of our funds, which represents the sum of the net asset value of such funds, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund level, including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). 2) Assets under management are as of September 30, 2016. 3) Distributions are not guaranteed and are made at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and will depend on Sierra Total Return Fund earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our Registered Investment Company (“RIC”) status and other factors the Sierra Total Return Fund Board may deem relevant. 4) There currently is no secondary market for Sierra Total Return Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. To provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase its shares at net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to provide this intended level of liquidity. 5) Public and Private Credit are part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Loan Strategy. 6) Public Investment Opportunities are part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Public Investment Fund Strategy. 7) Private Investment Opportunities are part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Private Investment Fund Strategy. 8) Pooled Credit is part of Sierra Total Return Fund’s Structured Products Strategy. 9) As described more fully in the prospectus, the Fund intends to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares on a quarterly basis. The Fund is an interval fund and, as such, has adopted a fundamental policy to make one repurchase offer of each class of outstanding shares at the NAV of that class of shares per year. In addition to this mandatory repurchase offer, the Fund intends to make three additional repurchase offers in each year. 
RISK DISCLOSURES
There currently is no secondary market for Sierra Total Return Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. To provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase its shares at net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to provide this intended level of liquidity. Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund’s NAV.
 
Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any securities exchange, which makes them inherently illiquid. Regardless of how the Fund performs, an investor may not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate his or her shares whenever such investor would prefer and will be unable to reduce his or her exposure or any market downturn. The Fund may pay distributions in significant part from sources that may not be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance.
 
Investing in the Fund involves risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective depends, in part, on the ability of its investment adviser to effectively allocate the assets of the Fund among the various securities and investments in which the Fund invests. There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the Fund’s investment objective or delivering positive returns. The Fund is newly organized and has a limited operating history.
 
Investors should be aware that traded and non-traded BDCs, senior loans, real estate investments and REITs, structured products and CLOs are all significantly different investments each with its own risks, rewards and limitations. Investors should understand these differences (which may include investment objectives, costs and expenses, liquidity, market risk, safety, fluctuation of principal or return, insurance, tax features, interest rate risk and consequences, etc.) before making an investment.
 
SC Distributors is the exclusive wholesale marketing agent for Sierra Total Return Fund. ALPS Distributors, Inc. is the distributor of Sierra Total Return Fund. SC Distributors and ALPS Distributors, Inc. are not affiliated. ALPS Distributor, Inc., 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203, member FINRA.
 
The Fund will concentrate its investments in debt and equity fixed income and its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the debt/credit markets. The value of companies engaged in the debt/credit industry is affected by: (i) changes in general economic and market conditions; (ii) changes in the value of debt investments; (iii) risks related to local economic conditions and increased competition and (iv) changes in interest rates and leverage.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Sierra Total Return Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting www.sierratotalreturnfund.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Risk Factors


Investing in our shares involves a number of significant risks. You should consider carefully the information found in the “Risk Factors” section of our prospectus before making an investment in our shares. The risks involved in investing in us include, but are not limited to: 
(1) Because the Fund is newly organized, its shares have no pricing or performance history.
(2) The Fund has no minimum asset threshold that must be satisfied prior to launch. The amount of capital actually raised by the Fund may be insufficient to allow the Fund to realize its investment objective, which may adversely affect the Fund’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
(3) Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any securities exchange, which makes them inherently illiquid.
(4) There is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares, and it is not anticipated that a secondary market will develop.
(5) Shares of the Fund are not redeemable.
(6) In order to provide some liquidity to its shareholders, the Fund intends to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares on a quarterly basis. One of the Fund’s repurchase offers will be conducted pursuant to a fundamental policy, pursuant to which the Fund intends to offer to repurchase 5% of its outstanding shares on a non-discretionary basis in the third calendar quarter of each year. Subject to the Fund’s discretion, the remaining three repurchase offers are intended to be in the first, second and fourth calendar quarters of each year and in such amounts as the Fund’s board of trustees may determine in its sole discretion. There can be no assurance, however, that any Discretionary Repurchase will be made. In addition, you will be charged an early withdrawal charge of 1.00% if you elect to have the Fund repurchase your Class T shares during the first year of your purchase.
(7) You should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time. 
(8) Regardless of how the Fund performs, an investor may not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate his or her shares whenever such investor would prefer and will be unable to reduce his or her exposure on any market downturn.
(9) If and to the extent that a public trading market ever develops, shares of closed-end investment companies, such as the Fund, may have a tendency to trade frequently at a discount from their NAV per share, which is determined daily, and initial offering prices.
(10) The amount of distributions that the Fund may pay, if any, is uncertain.
(11) The Fund may pay distributions in significant part from sources that may not be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance, such as from offering proceeds, borrowings, and amounts from the Fund’s affiliates that are subject to repayment by investors.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Medley Launches Sierra Total Return Fund
BY Business Wire— 9:00 AM ET 01/31/2017


 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Medley Management Inc. (MDLY) (“Medley”), a credit-focused asset
      management firm, today announced the launch of Sierra Total Return Fund
      , a closed-end investment management
      company that is operated as an interval fund.
    

      The Fund seeks to achieve total returns through a combination of current
      income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of
      debt and fixed-income related equity securities. The Fund expects to
      achieve these investment objectives through a disciplined and balanced
      allocation among four distinct asset strategies, including public and
      private credit, public investment funds, private investment funds and
      other structured credit products.
    

      “The Fund is designed to allow shareholders access to both public and
      private securities at all levels of the capital structure,” said Seth
      Taube, the Fund’s Chief Executive Officer. “Through the Fund, retail
      investors have the opportunity to invest in an institutional credit
      strategy that offers an attractive alternative in today’s yield-starved
      fixed income market.”
    

      The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end investment management company
      that is operated as an interval fund that continuously offers its shares
      on a daily basis. The Fund requires a minimum initial investment of
      $2,500 for regular accounts or retirement plan accounts. To provide
      liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to
      repurchase its outstanding shares at net asset value. There can be no
      assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to provide this intended
      level of liquidity.

      fixed-income related equity securities. The Fund is sponsored by Medley

      guarantees of future performance or results and involve a number of

      Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, the Fund

      All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press

Important Risk Information


Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives,
      risks, charges and expenses of the Fund. This and other important
      information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be
      obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting www.sierratotalreturnfund.com.
      The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.


Investing in the Fund involves risks, including, but not limited to,
      the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or
      that you may lose part or all of your investment. The ability of the
      Fund to achieve its investment objective depends, in part, on the
      ability of its investment adviser to effectively allocate the assets of
      the Fund among the various securities and investments in which the Fund
      invests. There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be
      effective in achieving the Fund’s investment objective or delivering
      positive returns. Investment return and principal value of an investment
      will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth
      more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds,
      ETFs, interval funds, and closed-end funds, in which the Fund may
      invest, are subject to management and other expenses, which will be
      indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit
      risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued
      as bonds, debentures, notes, or preferred shares with the option to
      convert into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock. As a
      result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of
      both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with
      both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities
      may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in
      losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline
      in the value of fixed-income securities. The use of leverage, such as
      borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur
      additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses.


There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the
      Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. Limited liquidity is
      expected to be provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s
      quarterly repurchase offers, regardless of how the Fund performs. The
      Fund is an interval fund and, as such, has adopted a fundamental policy
      to make one repurchase offer of each class of outstanding shares at the
      net asset value or NAV of that class of shares per year. In addition to
      this mandatory repurchase offer, the Fund intends to make three
      additional repurchase offers in each year. Investments in lesser-known,
      small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than
      larger, more established organizations. The Fund’s investments may be
      negatively affected by the broad investment environment and capital
      markets in which the Fund invests, including the real estate market, the
      debt market and/or the equity securities market. The value of the Fund’s
      investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices of
      the investments that it holds. This will cause the value of the Fund’s
      shares to increase or decrease. The Fund is “non-diversified” under the
      Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, since changes in the
      financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause a
      greater fluctuation in the Fund’s net asset value than in a
      “diversified” fund. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment
      program.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

(MDLY) (“Medley”), a credit-focused asset management firm, today announced the launch of Sierra Total Return Fund (NASDAQ: SRNTX or the “Fund”), a closed-end investment management company that is operated as an interval fund.The Fund seeks to achieve total returns through a combination of current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of debt and fixed-income related equity securities. The Fund expects to achieve these investment objectives through a disciplined and balanced allocation among four distinct asset strategies, including public and private credit, public investment funds, private investment funds and other structured credit products.“The Fund is designed to allow shareholders access to both public and private securities at all levels of the capital structure,” said Seth Taube, the Fund’s Chief Executive Officer. “Through the Fund, retail investors have the opportunity to invest in an institutional credit strategy that offers an attractive alternative in today’s yield-starved fixed income market.”The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end investment management company that is operated as an interval fund that continuously offers its shares on a daily basis. The Fund requires a minimum initial investment of $2,500 for regular accounts or retirement plan accounts. To provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase its outstanding shares at net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to provide this intended level of liquidity.About Sierra Total Return FundSierra Total Return Fund is a closed-end investment management company that is operated as an interval fund.

Statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings by the Fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, the Fund undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release.Important Risk InformationInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting www.sierratotalreturnfund.com. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.Read MoreInvesting in the Fund involves risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective depends, in part, on the ability of its investment adviser to effectively allocate the assets of the Fund among the various securities and investments in which the Fund invests. There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the Fund’s investment objective or delivering positive returns. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, interval funds, and closed-end funds, in which the Fund may invest, are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Preferred securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Convertible securities are typically issued as bonds, debentures, notes, or preferred shares with the option to convert into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock. As a result, convertible securities are hybrids that have characteristics of both bonds and common stocks and are subject to risks associated with both debt securities and equity securities. Issuers of debt securities may not make scheduled interest and principal payments, resulting in losses to the Fund. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed-income securities. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s gains or losses.There currently is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. Limited liquidity is expected to be provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers, regardless of how the Fund performs. The Fund is an interval fund and, as such, has adopted a fundamental policy to make one repurchase offer of each class of outstanding shares at the net asset value or NAV of that class of shares per year. In addition to this mandatory repurchase offer, the Fund intends to make three additional repurchase offers in each year. Investments in lesser-known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The Fund’s investments may be negatively affected by the broad investment environment and capital markets in which the Fund invests, including the real estate market, the debt market and/or the equity securities market. The value of the Fund’s investments will increase or decrease based on changes in the prices of the investments that it holds. This will cause the value of the Fund’s shares to increase or decrease. The Fund is “non-diversified” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, since changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause a greater fluctuation in the Fund’s net asset value than in a “diversified” fund. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program.SC Distributors is the exclusive wholesale marketing agent for Sierra Total Return Fund.
