Andrew G. Sharkey, III: Why pull the plug on the President's Steel
Program?





The 
        Rushford Report Archives





Andrew G. Sharkey,
        III: Why pull the plug 
on the President�s
        Steel Program?





  
      

June,
      2003: Publius

By Greg Rushford
Published in the Rushford Report

On February 21, I criticized the domestic steel lobby
      in a speech in 

      Florida

      to the 14th Annual Tampa Steel Conference, which was hosted by the Tampa
      Port Authority. I said basically that the U.S. mills were quick to accuse
      foreigners of �dumping� and of benefiting from generous government
      subsidies � while themselves engaging in the same practices (see, What
      does the Stand Up For Steel lobby really stand for?, The Rushford Report,
      March 2003).
           
      There are always two sides of any story, of course. I�m happy to
      print a response written by Andrew G. Sharkey, III, the president and CEO
      of the American Iron and Steel Institute. Mr. Sharkey�s guest column
      explains why he thinks that we critics are wrong.
           
      Mr. Sharkey�s analysis follows:
           
      Any attempt to analyze accurately the effectiveness of President
      Bush�s three-part Steel Program must take into account the factors that
      caused the American steel crisis as well as the lengthy deliberations the
      Administration undertook before launching this steel tariff remedy in
      March of 2002.
           
      The origins of the steel crisis are well documented. Most
      production by large, non-U.S. steel mills (as much as 85%) has not been
      market-based. Production has often been subsidized, cartelized,
      government-owned or government-controlled. Since 1980 alone, foreign
      subsidies have totaled more than $100 billion.
           
      For decades, nearly every foreign steel market has been protected
      by high tariffs, quotas, restrictive licensing agreements, domestic
      cartels, international mill-to-mill agreements, and other private
      anticompetitive behavior. This made the United States the largest, most
      open market in the world, and deluged it with subsidized and dumped steel,
      very often sold far below the real cost of production.

       



      U.S.

      commitment to Rules-Based Trade
The President is committed to enforcing 

      U.S.

      laws, consistent with the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
      to promote trade based on genuine comparative advantages and to combat the
      destructive consequences of subsidized, injurious and dumped imports on
      American industries.
           
      World Trade Organization (WTO) rules recognize, when imports cause
      harm to competing domestic industries, temporary restraints may be imposed
      to permit orderly adjustment and restructuring. Notwithstanding the
      systematic bias of WTO panels against the use of trade laws, these WTO-sanctioned
      trade actions include Section 201-type �safeguard� provisions for
      industries when �increased imports� are a �substantial cause� of
      �serious injury.�

       

Section 201 as One Part of a Three-Part Plan
In June 2001, the President announced a three-part
      Steel Action Plan, and initiating the 201 investigation was only one part
      of this Plan.
           
      Regarding the 201, the President asked the International Trade
      Commission (ITC), an independent and bipartisan body, to investigate
      whether the 

      U.S.

      steel industry suffered serious injury from increased imports. With
      imports having driven 35 American steel companies (45 million net tons or
      over 35% of total U.S. steel capacity) into bankruptcy, and having
      destroyed more than 54,000 U.S. iron and steel worker jobs, the ITC came
      back with a unanimous �yes.� All six Commissioners said that increased
      imports were a substantial cause of serious injury to the 

      U.S.

      steel industry and five of the six recommended a tariff remedy.
           
      The 

      United States

      followed WTO rules scrupulously throughout the grueling eight-month 201
      process. Procedural steps were taken all along the way to protect the
      interests of parties on both sides. This includes customers and consumers,
      whose interests were carefully considered at all stages of the process.

       

Program is Working as Intended
It is useful to recount some of the accusations
      levied before the Administration Program was enacted. Critics:

       

�          
      questioned the industry�s long-term viability and argued that any
      relief would come too late to make a significant difference;

       

�          
      claimed Section 201 relief would simply prop up existing
      enterprises and prevent consolidation and restructuring within the
      industry; and

       

�          
      predicted Section 201 relief would undermine international
      negotiations on steel trade issues.

       

           
      Now, more than a year later, it is clear that the program is
      working as intended. Section 201 relief has brought badly needed stability
      to domestic steel producers. We have seen a modest but necessary price
      recovery that has had a positive impact on the bottom line of domestic
      steel producers.
           
      The President�s Steel Program has also helped to facilitate steps
      toward a fundamental consolidation and restructuring. U.S. Steel has just
      completed the purchase of the assets of national Steel Corporation. A new
      company, International Steel Group (ISG), has invested heavily in the
      industry, buying most of the assets of LTV and Bethlehem Steel, as well as
      selected assets of Acme Steel. Nucor has purchased the assets of Trico and
      Birmingham Steel. Steel Dynamics, Inc. bought Qualitech Steel�s assets
      and the GalvPro II LLC galvanizing facility. Gerdau SA North American
      acquired Co-Steel�s assets.
           
      If the Section 201 tariffs are kept in place for their full
      three-year term, 

      U.S.

      steelmakers will have the opportunity to follow through on restructuring,
      and the industry will be dramatically more efficient than when the process
      began. For example, ISG has already cut costs by 20 percent at the LTV
      mills it has reorganized.
           
      The President�s Steel Program also jumpstarted OECD talks on
      steel trade where about 40 governments are today actively negotiating a
      long-term agreement to ban most subsidies to steel producers.
      Participating governments are also discussing solutions to the endemic
      problem of massive excess steel capacity worldwide. These issues are
      finally being taken seriously � thanks in large part to the steel
      program the 

      United States

      has put in place.
           
      Even with these positive signs, domestic producers remain extremely
      vulnerable. In part, owing to the large number of exclusions from the
      relief, imports of finished steel were higher in 2002 than in 2001. The
      current economic slowdown has left us with weak demand, and, not
      surprisingly, these factors have pushed down prices substantially from
      their peaks of last summer. For many producers, the effort to return to
      sustained profitability has been difficult and remains uncertain.
           
      No industry can be expected to recover in little more than a year
      from the kind of injury the steel industry has endured over the last three
      decades. And access to capital would dry up in a heartbeat if tariffs were
      ended prematurely. If this industry is to be given the opportunity it
      needs to recover and restructure, it is critical that the Section 201
      relief remain in place for its full three-year duration.
Facts Don�t Support
Complaints by Foreign
Producers and Certain
Steel Consumers
Critics of the President�s remedy claim higher
      steel prices since Section 201 relief was implemented have put 

      U.S.

      steel-using industries at a competitive disadvantage. The facts do not
      support this claim.
           
      Over the last 12 months, as restructuring has lowered U.S.
      production costs, prices for critical �bench market products,� such as
      hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel have risen substantially more
      in foreign markets than in the United States. Today, it is less expensive
      to buy steel for fabrication in auto parts, appliance and other industries
      than it is in most of 
      Europe
      and 
      Asia
      .
           
      The fallacy in critics� reasoning is the assumption of a zero-sum
      game, in which any policy that benefits steel producers must harm our
      customers. 

      U.S.

      manufacturers need reliable sources of competitively priced steel, and a
      reconstituted and more efficient domestic steel industry will give them
      that!
           
      For over one hundred years Americans have played a leading role in
      the global steel industry. 

      America

      �s steelmakers are determined to carry this tradition into a new
      century.
           
      The last few years have been difficult but we are turning the
      corner. We will need to preserve and strengthen rules-based trade for all 

U.S.

 industries. However,
      thanks in large part to Section 201 relief, we see a new day for American
      steel making, a day when American steelmakers can compete with anyone in
      the world.
