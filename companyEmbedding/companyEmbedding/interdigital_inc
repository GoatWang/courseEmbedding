InterDigital is a mobile technology research and development company that provides wireless technologies for mobile devices, networks, and services worldwide. Founded in 1972, InterDigital is listed on NASDAQ and is included in the S&P MidCap 400 index.
InterDigital has a portfolio of about 20,000 U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications. In 2012 Business Insider put them on their list of the 8 most fearsome patent trolls.[4] This allegation was rebutted by CEO, Bill Merritt, in an interview the same year with Engadget: "Traditionally, people see trolls as companies that don't do their own development, or don't have products....we have hundreds of engineers, we participate in and often chair standards committees, and we partner with leading operators, infrastructure companies and solution providers to develop and test new solutions."[5]

Motion sickness is one of the issues facing the virtual reality market — some users experience motion sickness symptoms while using VR, because there can be slight differences between the user’s visual perception and what they feel as their body moves through space. Accuracy and speed of the multi-axis inertial measurement units (IMUs) in the VR headset is a significant factor in decreased incidence of motion sickness.

InterDigital is a mobile technology research and development company that provides wireless technologies for mobile devices, networks, and services worldwide. Founded in 1972, InterDigital is listed on NASDAQ and is included in the S&P MidCap 400 index.
InterDigital has a portfolio of about 20,000 U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications. In 2012 Business Insider put them on their list of the 8 most fearsome patent trolls.[4] This allegation was rebutted by CEO, Bill Merritt, in an interview the same year with Engadget: "Traditionally, people see trolls as companies that don't do their own development, or don't have products....we have hundreds of engineers, we participate in and often chair standards committees, and we partner with leading operators, infrastructure companies and solution providers to develop and test new solutions."[5]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  8.11 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $9.23      Market Cap $2.64 B     Shares Outstanding 34.68 M     Public Float 34.20 M     Yield 1.60% (07/28/17)      Latest Dividend $0.30 (07/26/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 07/10/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 1.97 M     Change from Last  -0.19%      Percent of Float 5.77%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.62      Net Money Flow ($)  -2.09 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
