Propanc Health Group Corp (OTCMKTS:PPCH) is consolidating well since the explosive move up it made in recent days. The stock has skyrocketed in recent months quickly transforming into one of the top traded stocks on the entire bb’s on heavy promotion from an Investment Newsletter called the Wealthy Biotech Trader as well as a paid feature in the NY Times Sunday Edition Magazine under Health Essentials: Cancer Prevention & Treatment on April 19th.
PPCH is focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Together with their scientific and oncology consultants, they have developed a rational, composite formulation of anti-cancer compounds which exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading throughout the body.
Propanc Health Group Corp (OTCMKTS:PPCH) lead drug candidate, PRP, is a once-daily pro-enzyme treatment as a clinically proven therapeutic option in the treatment and prevention of cancer. PRP would be the first therapy of its kind, as there are no FDA approved therapies used for the long-term prevention or management of these conditions. Propanc is focusing on providing oncologists and their patients with more effective metastatic cancer therapies with a substantially reduced side effect profile; specifically, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Improvement is needed for the standard of care for late stage cancer, with the incumbent treatments causing significant adverse effects for the modest benefits provided.
Propanc is seeking potential licensing partners within the next 12-18 months and the Company is also investigating acquisition opportunities that will expedite their strategic growth and strengthen their portfolio. Company management has stated that once the development projects have sufficiently progressed down the development pathway and have commensurately achieved a major increase in value, they will seek a suitable licensing partner to complete the remaining development activities, obtain regulatory approval and market the product.

Propanc recently filed an international patent application centered on enhancing pro-enzyme formulations and combination therapies comprising trypsinogen and chymotrypsin, and/or other specific anti-cancer agents.
On May 5 PPCH announced Game Changing News when they announced the first set of results from its series of animal studies, with PRP showing no adverse clinical signs at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in mice when administered by I.V injection. The MTD is more than twice the human equivalent dose administered to patients at the Dove Clinic for compassionate use.
Prior to the MTD mice study, the two proenzymes were individually assessed to measure activity in cell culture studies, with both active ingredients displaying inhibitory activity in pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines.
PPCH Chief Scientific Officer Dr Julian Kenyon said “These findings are significant, because it gives us confidence that PRP appears to be safe and tolerable when administered by I.V injection at higher doses. Furthermore, we can now presume one hundred percent of the drug has been absorbed into the bloodstream. This is not the case when I first treated patients with proenzymes with a suppository formulation at the Dove Clinic, which is expected to have a lower absorption rate.”
PPCH has some big names behind it; Klaus Kutz, CMO of Propanc has prepared multiple investigational new drugs (IND) FDA applications for Sanofi, a $48 stock. Dr. Ralph Brandt of Propanc successfully led the tumor biology program for animal studies at Novartis. Novartis is now trading at $98 a share.
On June 16 The Wealthy Biotech Trader announced it would like to report on the seldom huge potential of the OTC market when used as a proper stepping-stone to a national stock exchange.
Very seldom do you see long-term success in the sometimes scary OTC market. One might gauge long-term success as assembling a world class management team, raising some capital on not-so-good terms, and bringing a business plan to the point where it’s considered a valuable asset. Down this road, there are many more things that can go wrong than can go right. The proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow would be the infamous “up-listing” to the NASDAQ or the NYSE-by way of achieving the aforementioned goals, but also quantifiable goals like share price and book value increases. It’s not an easy task.

Currently trading at a $40 million market valuation PPCH has no revenues to date, minimal assets and significant rising short term debt. But this is an exciting story that is taking the small caps by storm; this tiny biotech is developing new cancer treatments that could blow this story wide open. We will be updating on PPCH on a daily basis so make sure you are subscribed to microcapdaily.com so you know what is going on with PPCH.

Propanc Difference :: Propanc Biopharma, Inc. (PPCB)



























  
































	About






Using Differentiation Therapy to Combat Cancer

Instead of targeting tumor cell death, we are focusing on inducing cell differentiation. By convincing malignant cells to stop proliferating, we are encouraging them to return to do their work as a specific cell type.
How do common cancer therapies work?
Common cancer therapies take advantage of the uncontrolled proliferation of the cancer cells and kill these cells by targeting the cell division machinery. These therapies are effective, but affect healthy cells as well, particularly those with a high rate of cell turnover, inducing undesirable side effects.

Advantages of Differentiation Therapies Over Common Therapies

Differentiation therapy does not target cell death, so healthy cells within the patient will not be compromised as it happens with common therapies like chemotherapeutic drugs or gamma irradiation. 
Differentiation therapy induces the cancer cells into the pathway of terminal differentiation and eventual senescence. It acts not only against cancer cells but interestingly can turn cancer stem cells (undifferentiated cells) towards completely differentiated (i.e. normal) cells.

Propanc Health Group Corp (OTCMKTS:PPCH) is making another highly explosive move up on big volume off its new base around $0.02 a share.
The stock recently made a spectacular move up from subs to $0.10 a share that started in mid-March after a newsletter called the Wealthy Biotech Trader announced that “Biotech Company Could Be on the Cusp of New Proenzyme Drug for the Treatment and Prevention of Certain Forms of Cancer.”
In recent news an Analyst Brief Issued by BrokerBank Securities said ”PPCH lead product includes PRP, a patented formulation consisting of two pro-enzymes, such as trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, as well as the enzyme amylase designed to synergistically enhance anti-cancer effects. It is also developing a combination of anti-cancer agents working in combination with pro-enzymes, which enhance PRP’s anti-cancer effects. The company was formerly known as Propanc PTY LTD. Propanc Health Group Corporation was founded in 2007 and is based in Melbourne, Australia.
Propanc Health Group Corp (OTCMKTS:PPCH) is focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Together with their scientific and oncology consultants, they have developed a rational, composite formulation of anti-cancer compounds which exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading throughout the body.
PPCH leading products are variations upon our novel formulation and involve or employ pro-enzymes, which are inactive precursors of enzymes. As a result of positive early indications of the anti-cancer effects of our technology, we intend to submit our pro-enzyme treatment to the rigorous, formal non-clinical and clinical development and trial processes required to obtain the regulatory approval necessary to commercialize it and any product(s) derived and/or to be derived therefrom.
In the near term, PPCH intends to target patients with limited remaining therapeutic options for the treatment of solid tumors such as colorectal or pancreatic tumors. In the future, we intend to development our lead product to treat (i) early stage cancer and (ii) pre-cancerous diseases and (iii) as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening.
On March 10 the Wealthy Biotech Trader announced some recent breakthroughs in the development of new cancer treatments, and the companies that play in the field.
Chemotherapy and other key cancer treatments have so far only been effective in the elimination of cancer cells that are at the initial stages. Propanc Health Group Corp PPCH is a Company developing a revolutionary new drug, which in its trial stages, set to provide a lasting treatment option for advanced cancer cells. It will also prevent the re-growth of cancer cells through metastasis.

Since 2007, Propanc, an innovative biopharmaceutical company, has been working with extensive drug development and oncology and clinical experts, Professor Klaus Kutz and Dr. Julian Kenyon whose combined experience of more than 60 years in medicine has been critical in the research and development of PRP anti-cancer treatment.
By focusing on metastasis (cancer spreading) as the main and most difficult challenge to treating cancer, Propanc’s PRP is designed to ensure that malignant cancer cells cannot transfer to secondary locations and seed new tumors. Its multi-functional cancer fighting properties ensure enhanced production of the naturally occurring protein E-Cadherin to prevent metastasis, prevent the transformation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and prevents cancer cell re-growth, hence preventing the spreading of cancer to vital organs of the body.
By restoring E-Cadherin levels, transition of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells is inhibited in a process that prevents the growth of invasive cells travelling to other parts of the body through the lymphatic system or blood into surrounding tissues. PRP works by altering several critical pathways for cancer cells that otherwise lead to the growth of malignant tumors.
On March 19 PPCH announced it has commenced the second stage of its POP1 research program with the University of Jaen, Spain, to investigate further the anti-cancer effects and cellular mechanisms associated with proenzymes as a treatment for cancer. The aim is to identify new patentable drugs as back up compounds to the Company’s lead product, PRP.
PPCH CEO James Nathanielsz said “Our intention is to aggressively screen and develop new compounds for future development as a back up to our lead product, PRP. We hope to establish an exciting new treatment class in oncology which complements existing treatments and helps reduce the threat of tumor recurrence and metastasis. This is part of our strategic plan.”

PPCH has no revenues to date, minimal assets and significant rising short term debt. But this is an exciting story developing in small caps and the stock is quickly attracted a large, fast growing shareholder base that swears this one goes way higher. $0.10 is the new magic tipping point: We will be updating on PPCH on a daily basis so make sure you are subscribed to microcapdaily.com so you know what is going on with PPCH.

The company's research and development activities have been focused on anti-cancer compounds targeting cancer patients suffering from solid tumors such as pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers. Propanc's formulation of anti-cancer compounds utilizes pro-enzyme therapy. Its lead drug candidate, PRP, is a patented formulation consisting of two proenzymes, trypsinogen (T) & chymotrypsinogen (C) from bovine pancreas. PRP targets malignant cancer cells through multiple pathways, which the company believes may create a lasting clinical benefit for the patient. Propanc is currently completing non-clinical studies and intends to undertake Phase I, II and III clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of their product in specific patient populations. The company has also stated that it is pursuing strategic partners in the industry, and that it hopes to have meaningful discussions with potential partners following the release of new data.Additional highlights from the update note are as follows:Propanc CEO provides positive investor updatePropanc CEO, James Nathanielsz provided a detailed investor update in January, highlighting accomplishments by the company in 2016 and outlining its clinical plans as the company seeks to begin a Phase 1 human study by the end of 2017. Key accomplishments during 2016 included a successful scientific advice meeting with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, MHRA, in the UK, during which the company defined the non-clinical and clinical development pathway for PRP. Other accomplishments included developing an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, executing a manufacturing agreement with Belgium-based AmatsiQBiologicals, and developing a new infrared dye-labelled detection method for trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, the proenzymes used in PRP.Propanc receives US patent allowance Importantly Propanc has made progress advancing its intellectual property protection. The company submitted four new patents in the US, Australia and Spain, during 2016, relating to dosage and mechanism of action for its two proenzymes used in PRP, two proenzymes, trypsinogen (T) & chymotrypsinogen (C). Importantly, in January, Propanc received a notification of allowance from the US Patent Office providing coverage for a method of treating a solid tumor through administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen to patients, a noteworthy accomplishment.Low dose group 28-day GLP-compliant toxicity study completeLooking ahead to 2017, Propanc is quickly moving to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for PRP by the end of the year. The company took a step in that direction recently, with the announcement that it had successfully completed the low dose group for its GLP-compliant 28-day repeat dose toxicity study. With no safety concerns in the low dose group, Propanc received approval to proceed with the middle and high dose groups from the International Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) in Melbourne, Australia.Updating price target to $0.05 for PPHC We are updating our price target to $0.05 for PPCH. This reflects the increase in shares since our initial valuation of the company in 2015 and continued capital needs, offset by the large opportunity targeted by the company with new potential therapies for pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancer. We continue to see Propanc as an intriguing microcap biotechnology company with a pre-clinical therapeutic pipeline targeting end markets with multi-billion dollar potential if the company can show efficacy in clinical trials and execute on a partner-based strategy for regulatory approval and commercialization.Please review important disclosures on our website at www.seethruequity.com.About Propanc Health Group Corporation Read MorePropanc is developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers. We have developed a formulation of anti-cancer compounds, which exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading throughout the body. Our products involve or employ pancreatic proenzymes, which are inactive precursors of enzymes. In the near term, we intend to target patients with limited remaining therapeutic options for the treatment of solid tumors. In future, we intend to develop our lead product to treat (i) early stage cancer and (ii) pre-cancerous diseases and (iii) as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening. www.Propanc.com.About SeeThruEquitySince its founding in 2011, SeeThruEquity has been committed to its core mission: providing impactful, high quality research on underfollowed smallcap and microcap equities.
