Claims Processing and Clearinghouse Services
FGA is a leader in Claims Processing and has been a leading clearinghouse for the past 20 years!
KeyClaims is a flexible and User Friendly web based interface that allows any healthcare provider to manage their entire billing process.
This is how KeyClaims works:

Claim data is entered directly on claims, on the KeyClaims website to be tracked through claim status reports.

The KeyClaims/Claims2Cash site serves as the repository for all claims management functions including viewing, editing, correcting, and re-submitting claims.

Claims validation occurs in real-time, errors are immediately identified during the entry process. If a claim cannot be corrected it is put on "Hold". Clean claims are passed on to the payers in HIPAA compliant format.

When Claims on "Hold" are corrected, they are validated in real-time to ensure they are correct and then submitted to the clearinghouse.

Features:

Electronic Claim Submission
KeyClaims available for direct data entry
Patient roster for claim entry
Complete Library of current ICD codes
Correct rejected claims & resubmit immediately

Benefits:

KeyClaims speeds data entry & reduces errors
