Abstract
CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric’s (CEHE) Smart Grid Project
						(Project) consists of (1) advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)
						including the deployment of more than 2.2 million advanced meters
						across CEHE’s entire service territory; (2) communications
						infrastructure which links the meters and facilitates the transfer
						of usage data from the meter back to CEHE’s data collection engine
						and ultimately to customers through the Smart Meter Texas (SMT)
						Web portal; and (3) distribution automation system upgrades
						covering a portion of the service territory. This area encompasses
						a portion of the Texas Medical Center (the world’s largest medical
						center), Houston’s key business districts, the Port of Houston,
						petrochemical infrastructure facilities that are vital to the
						nation’s fuel supply, and high reliability impact areas along the
						northern portion of the service territory. Project objectives
						include (1) automating meter reading, (2) eliminating truck rolls,
						(3) enabling residential and commercial customers to effectively
						manage and control their electricity usage, and (4) improving
						distribution system efficiency and reliability.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
To learn more visit our blog.



Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Centerpoint Energy Plaza, CenterPoint Energy headquarters in Downtown Houston


CenterPoint Energy is a Fortune 500 electric and natural gas utility serving several markets in the U.S. states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. It was formerly known as Reliant Energy (from which it is now separated), NorAm Energy, Houston Industries, and HL&P. The company is headquartered in the CenterPoint Energy Tower at 1111 Louisiana Street in Downtown Houston.[2][3] Some of its notable subscribers include Retail Electric Providers (REPs), such as NRG Energy, Champion Energy, Dynowatt, Ambit Energy, Texas Power, Bounce Energy, MXenergy, Direct Energy, Stream Energy, First Texas Energy Corporation, Gexa Energy, Cirro Energy, and Kona Energy.

History[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


When the state of Texas deregulated the electricity market, the former Houston Lighting & Power (HL&P) was split into several companies.[4] In 2003 HL&P was split into Reliant Energy, Texas Genco, and CenterPoint Energy.[5]
Until December 15, 2004, CenterPoint Energy and its predecessors operated in its various markets under these names; they were used separately prior to Reliant Energy, and later in conjunction with the Reliant Energy and CenterPoint Energy names:

Minnegasco (Natural gas throughout parts of Minnesota)
Houston Lighting and Power (or HL&P) Houston-Galveston electric provider
Entex (Natural gas throughout South and East Texas, Southern Louisiana and Mississippi)
Arkla (Natural gas throughout Northern Louisiana, Northeast Texas,[6] Oklahoma, and Arkansas)

In late 2004, four private equity firms—the Texas Pacific Group, the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Hellman & Friedman—combined forces to purchase Texas Genco from Centerpoint. Later in 2006, Texas Genco was sold to NRG Energy of Princeton, N.J.

September 2008 power outage

A CenterPoint Energy facility in Downtown Houston.


Hurricane Ike caused great disruption of service in the Greater Houston Area, wiping out 2.1 million of CenterPoint Energy's 2.26 million clients' electricity.[citation needed] This was the largest power outage in the company's 130-year history, and the largest in the state's history.

Smart meter pilot program

In March 2009, the company’s five-year smart meter deployment began, delivering enhanced smart meter functionality to Retail Electric Providers (REPs). The company worked with the Department of Energy for a pilot program in Texas centered on energy consumption.[7] After working with 500-residential electricity customers in the Houston area, it was found that by using a smart meter, consumers cut down on energy use for the home.[7] The pilot program was funded in part by the $200 million it received from the federal stimulus act.[7]
CenterPoint Energy has been working with IBM. In 2013, IBM helped CenterPoint Energy develop the Customer Vision Platform. The Customer Vision Platform will give CenterPoint a 360-degree view of their 5 million metered customers, incorporating their gas, electric and home services customers. It’s going to give customers a range of choices around how they want to interact with CenterPoint while also providing a consistent experience across the board.[8]
Criticism[edit]
On December 16, 2005, CenterPoint Energy Inc. said it would restate its finances for 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 to correct accounting errors that overstated revenue and natural gas expenses.[9]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized CenterPoint Energy for spending $2.65 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $284 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $1.9 billion, and having an executive pay between $12 and $13 million for its top 5 executives.[10]

Until December 15, 2004, CenterPoint Energy and its predecessors operated in its various markets under these names; they were used separately prior to Reliant Energy, and later in conjunction with the Reliant Energy and CenterPoint Energy names:

Minnegasco (Natural gas throughout parts of Minnesota)
Houston Lighting and Power (or HL&P) Houston-Galveston electric provider
Entex (Natural gas throughout South and East Texas, Southern Louisiana and Mississippi)
Arkla (Natural gas throughout Northern Louisiana, Northeast Texas,[6] Oklahoma, and Arkansas)

In late 2004, four private equity firms—the Texas Pacific Group, the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Hellman & Friedman—combined forces to purchase Texas Genco from Centerpoint. Later in 2006, Texas Genco was sold to NRG Energy of Princeton, N.J.

A CenterPoint Energy facility in Downtown Houston.


Hurricane Ike caused great disruption of service in the Greater Houston Area, wiping out 2.1 million of CenterPoint Energy's 2.26 million clients' electricity.[citation needed] This was the largest power outage in the company's 130-year history, and the largest in the state's history.

Smart meter pilot program

In March 2009, the company’s five-year smart meter deployment began, delivering enhanced smart meter functionality to Retail Electric Providers (REPs). The company worked with the Department of Energy for a pilot program in Texas centered on energy consumption.[7] After working with 500-residential electricity customers in the Houston area, it was found that by using a smart meter, consumers cut down on energy use for the home.[7] The pilot program was funded in part by the $200 million it received from the federal stimulus act.[7]
CenterPoint Energy has been working with IBM. In 2013, IBM helped CenterPoint Energy develop the Customer Vision Platform. The Customer Vision Platform will give CenterPoint a 360-degree view of their 5 million metered customers, incorporating their gas, electric and home services customers. It’s going to give customers a range of choices around how they want to interact with CenterPoint while also providing a consistent experience across the board.[8]
Criticism[edit]
On December 16, 2005, CenterPoint Energy Inc. said it would restate its finances for 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005 to correct accounting errors that overstated revenue and natural gas expenses.[9]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized CenterPoint Energy for spending $2.65 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $284 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $1.9 billion, and having an executive pay between $12 and $13 million for its top 5 executives.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
