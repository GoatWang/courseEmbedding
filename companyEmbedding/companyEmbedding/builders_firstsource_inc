About Us 


Builders FirstSource is driven by the desire to provide professional class building materials and services to homebuilders and remodelers across the country.
In the 1990’s, the building materials industry changed significantly.  Homebuilders grew by acquisition, creating large national competitors.  Building materials manufacturers also consolidated.  It was inevitable that the building material supply industry, the companies between the consolidating manufacturers and consolidating homebuilders, must consolidate as well.  Builders FirstSource was born from this industry evolution.
In March 1998, the Company’s management team, with the backing of JLL Partners, a private investment firm with significant committed capital, made its first acquisition.  Builders FirstSource continued to grow through a combination of strategic acquisitions and internal expansion.  Between 1998 and the beginning of 2015, we acquired and integrated thirty-three companies.  In June 2005, Builders FirstSource completed an initial public offering of its common stock, after which JLL Partners maintained a significant investment in the company.  
On July 31, 2015, Builders FirstSource acquired its largest competitor, ProBuild Holdings LLC, creating a more diversified company with enhanced scale and improved geographic footprint.  The combined company, on a pro forma basis, generated over $6 billion in annual revenue in 2015 and currently operates approximately 400 locations in 40 states, with a market presence in 74 of the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States.
Builders FirstSource strives to be the preferred supplier of structural building materials and services to homebuilders and remodelers across the nation by giving them both personalized attention at the local level and a wide range of resources only offered by a large company.  Builders FirstSource’s goal is to provide outstanding products and services to every customer, regardless of size.

Adjusted net income was $12.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted net loss of $14.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016. This improvement was largely a result of cost savings realized, revenue growth, and interest savings driven by debt refinancing. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA grew $14.3 million to $76.1 million compared to $61.8 million for the first quarter of 2016. The year over year improvement was driven largely by cost savings initiatives and revenue growth, offset by commodity driven gross profit margin compression. Sales were $1,533.064 million compared to $1,397.114 million for the same period a year ago. Income from operations was $40.277 million compared to $22.779 million for the same period a year ago. Income before income taxes was $4.12 million compared to loss before income taxes of $12.445 million for the same period a year ago.

Net debt was $1,967.4 million as of March 31, 2017. Gross margin percentage was 24.5%, down approximately 50 basis points from 25% last year. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely attributable to the recent commodity price inflation drag on margins.

The company do not expect to pay federal taxes in 2017 due to current net operating loss carry forward position, assuming no material changes in shareholder base or tax code changes.
