Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results






GlobeNewswire



Jul 27, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































 ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., July 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:CNOB) (the "Company" or "ConnectOne"), parent company of ConnectOne Bank (the "Bank"), today reported net income of $7.7 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared with $11.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $10.9 million earned during the second quarter of 2016.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the current quarter versus $0.37 earned in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.36 earned in the second quarter of 2016. During the quarter we recorded a $9.7 million pretax expense due to further weakness in the valuation of NYC taxi medallions, thereby reducing the carrying value of our taxi medallion loan portfolio, which is predominantly corporate medallions, to $50.9 million. Excluding expense related to taxi medallion loan valuation and net securities gains, earnings per share increased to $0.42 for the second quarter of 2017, as compared with $0.38 for the first quarter of 2017 and $0.39 for the second quarter of 2016. Frank Sorrentino, ConnectOne's Chairman and CEO stated, "We are exceedingly pleased with our second quarter operating performance. Loans receivable increased by $190 million from the prior quarter-end and, consistent with our emphasis on diversifying our loan mix, commercial and industrial loans grew by $69 million, representing an annualized growth rate of 50.8% for this non-CRE segment.  Overall loan growth since year-end 2016 has amounted to $286 million, or 16.4% annualized.  Meanwhile, core deposit growth has also exhibited strong progress.  For the current quarter, our total demand deposits (including both interest and noninterest-bearing) increased by $49 million, or 16.0% on an annualized basis.  Additional deposit growth is expected through enhanced cash management service capabilities, expansion of our municipal and private-school relationships, and better utilization of our modern branch model which allows our staff to focus on sales. The Company remains focused on accelerating deposit growth so that it is commensurate with strong loan growth.  On a GAAP basis, return on average assets was 0.69% and return on average tangible equity was 7.80%; however, when excluding the aforementioned taxi charge, the adjusted return on average assets and return on average tangible equity was 1.20% and 13.5%, respectively, reflecting strengthening underlying core performance.  Meanwhile, our net interest margin widened by 5 basis points to 3.45% and the operating efficiency ratio improved to 41.6%, from 44.0% in the first quarter of 2017 due to seasonal factors and continued operational leverage.  We expect our efficiency ratio to improve further in future quarters.  Augmenting our efficiency and deposit gathering capabilities, we are proud to announce our new partnerships with Zelle, the consortium of the top 30 banks in the country to provide real-time payments, and with nCino, one of the most efficient and streamlined deposit and loan operating systems in the industry, which will continue to support our best-in-class efficiency metrics."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Assuming an initial public offering price as set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our common
stock in this offering will be $41,538,000 (or $47,821,200 if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of common stock from
us), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

We intend to contribute substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering to
the Bank for use as follows: (i) to support growth in the Bank’s loan and
investment portfolios; (ii) to acquire other banks or financial institutions, to
the extent such opportunities arise; and (iii) for general corporate purposes
while maintaining our capital ratios at acceptable levels. In addition, a larger
capital base will increase our legal lending limit and permit us to make larger
loans, and to better penetrate our market areas.

Proceeds held by us will be invested in short term investments until needed for
the uses described above. At the current time, we neither have any agreements
nor are we engaged in any negotiations to make any acquisitions, but are
constantly evaluating opportunities to do so.


The banking business is highly competitive. We face substantial immediate
competition and potential future competition both in attracting deposits and in
originating loans. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings banks and
savings and loan associations, many of which have assets, capital and lending
limits larger than those that we have or will have upon completion of this
offering. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers,
insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies,
credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities.

Our larger competitors have greater financial resources to finance wide-ranging
advertising campaigns.

Additionally, we endeavor to compete for business by providing high quality,
personal service to customers, customer access to our decision-makers and
competitive interest rates and fees. We seek to hire and retain quality
employees who desire greater responsibility than may be available working for a
larger employer. Additionally, the local real estate and other business
activities of our Directors help us develop business relationships by increasing
our profile in our communities.

In the financial services industry in recent years, intense market demands,
technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have eroded industry
classifications that were once clearly defined. As a result of increased
competition, existing banks have been forced to diversify their services,
increase rates paid on deposits and become more cost effective. Corresponding
changes in the regulatory framework have resulted in increasing homogeneity in
the financial services offered by financial institutions. Some of the results of
those market dynamics in the financial services industry include an increase in
the number of new bank and non-bank competitors and increased customer awareness
of product and service differences among competitors. Those results may be
expected to affect our business prospects.


Company Description
We are a New Jersey corporation and a registered bank holding company pursuant
to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, that was formed in 2008 to
serve as the holding company for ConnectOne Bank.

The Bank is a community-based, full-service commercial bank that was founded in
2005 with


 the belief that a high service institution can better identify and
serve the banking needs of small to medium-sized businesses, professional
entities and individuals than can a branch or subsidiary of a larger
out-of-market institution. The Bank operates from its headquarters located at
301 Sylvan Avenue in the Borough of Englewood Cliffs, Bergen County, New Jersey,
and through its seven other banking offices. We offer a broad range of
commercial and consumer banking services to our customers and expect people
living, working and shopping in our primary trade area to be the source of most
of our customer deposits and lending business.

Our business has experienced significant growth. Since inception we have
concentrated our asset generation efforts on commercial real estate,
construction and business loans and focused our deposit generation on
relationship-based core deposit accounts. Since December 31, 2006, total assets
have grown from $179.8 million to $883.8 million at September 30, 2012 and total
deposits have grown from $158.9 million to $724.3 million over the same
timeframe. We achieved profitability in our eighth quarter of operations and for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2012 reported a return on average
assets of 1.01%.

In recent years, we have achieved many milestones, including:

• Growing our total assets to approximately $883.8 million at September 30,    
  2012 from $514.8 million at December 31, 2009, representing a 21.8% compound 
  annual growth rate;                                                          

• Growing non-interest-bearing deposits to $148.7 million at September 30, 2012
  from $66.3 million at December 31, 2009;                                     

• Increasing our net income by 28.0% to $6.1 million during the first nine     
  months of 2012 from $4.8 million during the first nine months of 2011. Net   
  income for the full year 2011 was $6.7 million, representing a 41.0% increase
  from net income of $4.7 million earned in 2010;                              

• Acquiring the deposits and former branch location of Citizens Community Bank,
  which is now our Ridgewood office, in a FDIC-assisted transaction in 2009;   

• Being named one of the 50 Fastest growing Companies by NJBIZ (New Jersey’s   
  only weekly business journal);                                               

• Expanding beyond our original northeastern New Jersey market place with the  
  opening of our Holmdel branch in Monmouth County, New Jersey;                

• Winning a Forbes Enterprise Award honoring visionary small businesses; and

• Being recognized as one of the top five performing community banks in 2010   
  and one of the top fifteen best performing community banks in 2011 with      
  assets between $500 million and $5 billion in the United States by SNL       
  Financial LC.
