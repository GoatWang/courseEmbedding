A $13 billion hedge fund is sounding the alarm on one of the biggest trends in investing

Highfields Capital Management, a $13 billion hedge
    fund, has raised concerns about quant funds and passive
    investing in a letter to clients seen by Business
    Insider.


Quants use algorithms to make investment bets, while
    passive funds track market indexes. Both are challenging active
    managers, the human-backed stock pickers that have
    traditionally dominated Wall Street.


Quants, in particular, could worsen the next financial
    crisis, according to Highfields, an active manager.


  A $13 billion hedge fund that flies under the radar is sounding
  the alarm on one of the biggest investment trends: quants and
  passive investing.

  Highfields Capital Management flagged concerns this week about
  computer-driven trading in its second-quarter letter to
  investors, a copy of which was reviewed by Business Insider.

  Boston-based Highfields uses a fundamental value-investing
  strategy, and though it is one of the biggest hedge funds, it
  doesn't often get much attention.

  Quants could worsen the next financial crisis, Jonathon Jacobson,
  founder of Highfields, wrote in the letter. He highlighted the
  lead-up to the 1987 financial crisis and partly blamed "portfolio
  insurance," or "the concept of dynamically hedging an active
  portfolio with stock index futures."

  Portfolio insurance, he wrote, contributed "to the complacency as
  the market ascended to nosebleed territory and most definitely
  contributed to the downward spiral of that fateful Friday,
  Monday, and Tuesday in October 1987."





  "The strategies employed by many of today's quant and other
  systematic investors are essentially the same thing," he wrote.
  "They weight securities or asset classes based upon their 'risk'
  as measured by volatility. Much like portfolio insurance, this
  strategy gives the purveyor the comfort to take more risk than he
  or she would otherwise take, and 'works' well in benign markets."

  A representative for Highfields declined to comment.

  Quant strategies have recently pulled in huge amounts of money,
  becoming some of the biggest players in hedge funds. Renaissance
  Technologies, a secretive computer-driven fund, increased its
  assets by about 42% last year, adding $12 billion, and Two Sigma
  Investments grew by 20%, adding some $5 billion over last year,
  according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club
  ranking.

  Overall, the end could be near for quant strategies, according to
  Jacobson:

  "The bigger point is that the ability for both passive and quant
  funds to outperform active, fundamentally oriented managers into
  perpetuity is improbable at best. In regard to the 'quants,'
  hundreds of billions of dollars can't exploit the same
  'inefficiency' for long. My sense is that we are a lot closer to
  the end than the beginning of these strategies producing excess
  returns."

  Jacobson also touched on the market's historic low volatility, a
  common theme in hedge fund managers' recent client letters.
  Managers usually send letters to their clients in the weeks after
  the close of each quarter.

  Balyasny Asset Management, which manages $12 billion, wrote about
  quants and passive investors 
  fundamentally changing stock investing, and the $30 billion
  Baupost Group told clients earlier this month that low volatility
  could be a 
  harbinger of "the next financial crisis."

  Jacobson wrote:

  "Common sense would suggest markets should be more fragile, not
  less. Congress is hopelessly gridlocked. The attempt to reform
  Obamacare failed miserably. It seems more unlikely every day that
  either major tax reform and/or some sort of economic stimulus
  package will be enacted, and these are the twin premises that
  have underpinned the 'Trump trade.' Central bankers seem
  determined to end the dual policies of zero interest rates and
  quantitative easing. And from a geopolitical standpoint, we have
  a highly inexperienced and impetuous President sitting atop a
  world that has never seemed more precarious."

  He blamed quant funds for the complacency:

  "Typically, protracted periods of good market performance are
  characterized by low volatility and excessive complacency. We
  can't prove this, but we are convinced that 'quant' funds, which
  have attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in the last few
  years and a significant portion of which use leverage, and whose
  models and various strategies are largely based on price action
  and correlations extracted from the reasonably recent past when
  volatility has been low (largely of their own making), have
  contributed mightily to the illusion that market risk is low. As
  the money continues to flow into these strategies, this dynamic
  becomes self-fulfilling."

  The Highfields Capital IV LP fund, the firm's biggest fund, with
  about $5.6 billion under management, returned 1.2% for the first
  half of the year, according to investor documents. That's
  compared with a 9.3% gain in the S&P 500 and an 11% gain for
  the MSCI World index over the same period.

DEFINITION of 'Quant Fund'
An investment fund that selects securities based on quantitative analysis. In a quant fund, the managers build computer-based models to determine whether an investment is attractive. In a pure "quant shop" the final decision to buy or sell is made by the model; however, there is a middle ground where the fund manager will use human judgment in addition to a quantitative model. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Quant Fund'
If computers can beat world champion chess players, shouldn't they be able to beat the traders on Wall Street? That's the thinking behind quant funds, whose name comes from the term "quantitative analysis". The advantage is that computers aren't swayed by emotion, and they obviously react much faster than a person ever could. The problem is that humans have to program those computers, and even computers can make mistakes when they are programmed incorrectly. Remember the saying "garbage in, garbage out". To take advantage of the power of computers, you still have to figure out a superior investment strategy. The term "quantitative fund" also doesn't tell you anything about the actual investment strategy being used. Any study of a company or an industry based on quantitative data can be considered a quant strategy.

A $13 billion hedge fund is sounding the alarm on one of the biggest trends in investing

  Reuters




Highfields Capital Management, a $13 billion hedge
    fund, has raised concerns about quant funds and passive
    investing in a letter to clients seen by Business
    Insider.


Quants use algorithms to make investment bets, while
    passive funds track market indexes. Both are challenging active
    managers, the human-backed stock pickers that have
    traditionally dominated Wall Street.


Quants, in particular, could worsen the next financial
    crisis, according to Highfields, an active manager.


  A $13 billion hedge fund that flies under the radar is sounding
  the alarm on one of the biggest investment trends: quants and
  passive investing.

  Highfields Capital Management flagged concerns this week about
  computer-driven trading in its second-quarter letter to
  investors, a copy of which was reviewed by Business Insider.

  Boston-based Highfields uses a fundamental value-investing
  strategy, and though it is one of the biggest hedge funds, it
  doesn't often get much attention.

  Quants could worsen the next financial crisis, Jonathon Jacobson,
  founder of Highfields, wrote in the letter. He highlighted the
  lead-up to the 1987 financial crisis and partly blamed "portfolio
  insurance," or "the concept of dynamically hedging an active
  portfolio with stock index futures."

  Portfolio insurance, he wrote, contributed "to the complacency as
  the market ascended to nosebleed territory and most definitely
  contributed to the downward spiral of that fateful Friday,
  Monday, and Tuesday in October 1987."





  "The strategies employed by many of today's quant and other
  systematic investors are essentially the same thing," he wrote.
  "They weight securities or asset classes based upon their 'risk'
  as measured by volatility. Much like portfolio insurance, this
  strategy gives the purveyor the comfort to take more risk than he
  or she would otherwise take, and 'works' well in benign markets."

  A representative for Highfields declined to comment.

  Quant strategies have recently pulled in huge amounts of money,
  becoming some of the biggest players in hedge funds. Renaissance
  Technologies, a secretive computer-driven fund, increased its
  assets by about 42% last year, adding $12 billion, and Two Sigma
  Investments grew by 20%, adding some $5 billion over last year,
  according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club
  ranking.

  Overall, the end could be near for quant strategies, according to
  Jacobson:

  "The bigger point is that the ability for both passive and quant
  funds to outperform active, fundamentally oriented managers into
  perpetuity is improbable at best. In regard to the 'quants,'
  hundreds of billions of dollars can't exploit the same
  'inefficiency' for long. My sense is that we are a lot closer to
  the end than the beginning of these strategies producing excess
  returns."

  Jacobson also touched on the market's historic low volatility, a
  common theme in hedge fund managers' recent client letters.
  Managers usually send letters to their clients in the weeks after
  the close of each quarter.

  Balyasny Asset Management, which manages $12 billion, wrote about
  quants and passive investors 
  fundamentally changing stock investing, and the $30 billion
  Baupost Group told clients earlier this month that low volatility
  could be a 
  harbinger of "the next financial crisis."

  Jacobson wrote:

  "Common sense would suggest markets should be more fragile, not
  less. Congress is hopelessly gridlocked. The attempt to reform
  Obamacare failed miserably. It seems more unlikely every day that
  either major tax reform and/or some sort of economic stimulus
  package will be enacted, and these are the twin premises that
  have underpinned the 'Trump trade.' Central bankers seem
  determined to end the dual policies of zero interest rates and
  quantitative easing. And from a geopolitical standpoint, we have
  a highly inexperienced and impetuous President sitting atop a
  world that has never seemed more precarious."

  He blamed quant funds for the complacency:

  "Typically, protracted periods of good market performance are
  characterized by low volatility and excessive complacency. We
  can't prove this, but we are convinced that 'quant' funds, which
  have attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in the last few
  years and a significant portion of which use leverage, and whose
  models and various strategies are largely based on price action
  and correlations extracted from the reasonably recent past when
  volatility has been low (largely of their own making), have
  contributed mightily to the illusion that market risk is low. As
  the money continues to flow into these strategies, this dynamic
  becomes self-fulfilling."

  The Highfields Capital IV LP fund, the firm's biggest fund, with
  about $5.6 billion under management, returned 1.2% for the first
  half of the year, according to investor documents. That's
  compared with a 9.3% gain in the S&P 500 and an 11% gain for
  the MSCI World index over the same period.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

If so, I will return to buy many more.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
