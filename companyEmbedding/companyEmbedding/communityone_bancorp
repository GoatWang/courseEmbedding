CommunityOne Bank

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

CommunityOne Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of CommunityOne Bancorp., is a bank headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, with 50 offices in North Carolina and $2 billion in assets as of July 2014.
History[edit]
The First National Bank of Asheboro began operations January 14, 1908. In 1976, after adding branches around Randolph County, the bank changed its name to First National Bank of Randolph County.
In 1985, with assets of less than $100 million, the bank formed the holding company FNB Corp. Expansion into other counties starting in 1987 resulted in a name change to First National Bank and Trust Company in 1990.
First National began acquiring other banks: Richmond Savings Bank in 2000, Rowan Savings Bank in 2004, Alamance in 2005 and First Gaston Bank in 2006.
The holding company changed its name to FNB United Corp. in 2006. The bank's name changed to CommunityOne in 2007. Dover Mortgage Company, acquired in 2003, became a subsidiary of CommunityOne in 2007.[1]
In 2010, the United States Department of Justice filed charges relating to a $40 million Ponzi scheme by a depositor. On April 27, 2011, the Justice Department said it agreed to delay prosecution for two years if CommunityOne paid $400,000 in restitution and worked harder to prevent similar incidents. According to a Justice Department news release, CommunityOne "waived indictment and accepted and acknowledged responsibility for its conduct."[2]
On April 27, 2011, FNB United Corp., which was on the "verge of failure" and had "negative net worth", announced a merger with Bank of Granite Corp., parent company of Bank of Granite. The resulting company, to be called FNB United Corp., will have $2.9 billion in assets, $2.4 billion in deposits, and 63 offices. The deal requires FNB to raise $310 million in capital, with half coming from a stock offering and half the Carlyle Group and Oak Hill Capital Partners. The two private equity firms agreed to invest on the condition that FNB "resolve prosecutors' claims."[3] The deal was completed June 8, 2013 and on July 1, 2013, FNB United's name became CommunityOne Bancorp, with the stock symbol changing from "FNBN" to "COB".[4] After the merger, CommunityOne moved its headquarters to Charlotte.[5]
On October 26, 2016, Capital Bank Financial completed its acquisition of CommunityOne, which had $2.4 billion in assets and 45 branches and based in Charlotte, North Carolina, [6] in a deal worth $350 million.[7]

CommunityOne Bank To Launch New Brand And Products






GlobeNewswire



Jan 3, 2013 11:23 AM EST













 




























































    ASHEBORO, N.C., Jan. 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CommunityOne Bank, N.A. has announced it will launch a new brand and introduce enhancements to its product offerings to better reflect the future of the company and its anticipated merger with Bank of Granite.                                                            "As we continue to bring CommunityOne and Bank of Granite together, it's important to define and present our company as a new and well capitalized organization," commented Bob Reid, President of CommunityOne. "Our strengths are the same as they've always been. We're a bank that believes true customer service means learning about your customers' needs and goals, and offering professional advice and services to help meet those needs and goals."  The new CommunityOne brand will consist of conventional upgrades, such as a new logo and colors, but will also incorporate community wherever possible. In fact, customers and employees who give their permission will be featured in bank ads and other marketing materials.  "We're literally featuring our customers and employees as part of our new brand," stated Brian Simpson, Chief Executive Officer of CommunityOne. "It's our way of showing the outside world we identify with people as human beings, not numbers."  In conjunction with the new brand, the bank is enhancing many of its products for the first time in several years. For bank customers, changes to existing deposit accounts will take effect on Tuesday, February 19, following the Presidents' Day holiday on Monday. Deposit product changes will not affect customer account numbers, loan products or branch phone numbers or addresses.

ASHEBORO, N.C., Jan. 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CommunityOne Bank, N.A. has announced it will launch a new brand and introduce enhancements to its product offerings to better reflect the future of the company and its anticipated merger with Bank of Granite.

	"As we continue to bring CommunityOne and Bank of Granite together, it's important to define and present our company as a new and well capitalized organization," commented Bob Reid, President of CommunityOne. "Our strengths are the same as they've always been. We're a bank that believes true customer service means learning about your customers' needs and goals, and offering professional advice and services to help meet those needs and goals."

	The new CommunityOne brand will consist of conventional upgrades, such as a new logo and colors, but will also incorporate community wherever possible. In fact, customers and employees who give their permission will be featured in bank ads and other marketing materials.

	"We're literally featuring our customers and employees as part of our new brand," stated Brian Simpson, Chief Executive Officer of CommunityOne. "It's our way of showing the outside world we identify with people as human beings, not numbers."

	In conjunction with the new brand, the bank is enhancing many of its products for the first time in several years. For bank customers, changes to existing deposit accounts will take effect on Tuesday, February 19, following the Presidents' Day holiday on Monday. Deposit product changes will not affect customer account numbers, loan products or branch phone numbers or addresses.

	While the bank's brand is officially changing on February 19, signs and ATMs in select markets will begin reflecting the new logo and colors in early January. Certain items, such as checks and debit cards, will be updated gradually over time or at the point of reorder. 

	"We think the bank's new brand will be well received," commented Reid. "We're proud to serve our customers and want them to feel equally proud about banking with CommunityOne. They're our greatest focus and the reason we're in business."

	CommunityOne Bank, N.A. is a subsidiary of FNB United Corp. Opened in 1907, CommunityOne operates 44 branches in 37 communities throughout central, southern and western North Carolina, and offers a wide variety of consumer, mortgage, wealth and business banking services, including loan, deposit, cash management, and online banking services. CommunityOne Bank is an equal housing lender and a member of the FDIC.

	The CommunityOne logos are available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=16449 and http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=16450
