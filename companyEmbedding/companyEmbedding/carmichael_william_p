William P. Carmichael (BS '65)
  Academy of Alumni Fellows 2007

Bill Carmichael co-founded The Succession Fund in 1998 to provide an exit strategy to the owners of privately held companies.  Mr. Carmichael provides consulting advice to the owners or may arrange for an investment group to buy out the owners in a tax-advantaged transaction.  He has also served as an expert witness in trials on financial matters and on mergers and acquisitions.
Prior to forming The Succession fund, Mr. Carmichael worked for Price Waterhouse for four years and had twenty-six years of experience in various financial positions with global consumer product companies.  Positions he held include Senior Vice President of Sara Lee Corporation, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Beatrice Foods Company, and Vice President of Esmark, Inc.  His experience includes all financial functions, strategic planning, and substantial merger and acquisition work.
Mr. Carmichael is a Director of Simmons Company, Cobra Electronics Corporation (NASDAQ), The Finish Line (NASDAQ), Spectrum Brands (NYSE), and Chairman of the Columbia Funds (Bank of America advised mutual funds).  Previous boards include Avis, Playtex, Electrolux, Health-o-meter/Mr.Coffee, Opta Food Ingredients, the Golden Rule Insurance Company, Kubin-Nicholson Corporation, and the Hain Food Group.
The charitable activities of Mr. Carmichael include serving on the Mergers and Acquisition Committee of the Chicago Minority Business Development Council, the Board of Directors of The Infant Welfare Society of Chicago; the Business Advisory Council of the University of Virginia Law School; the Advisory Board of the Indiana University Art Museum; the Dean’s Advisory Council of the Indiana University Kelley School of Business; and the Board of Directors of the Indiana University Foundation, where he is Treasurer and is Chairman of the Investment Committee.

The Kelley Alumni Network

When you chose the IU Kelley School of Business, you became part of a vast network of alumni.  Leverage this resource to navigate your career path and build your professional network.  Contribute your expertise and experience.  Invest in programs and initiatives that support the School's mission.
CONNECT TO THE POWER OF YOUR NETWORK!


Are You Satisfied?

	Several websites, publications and rankings rate the satisfaction of b-school alumni/alumni networks by the participation in annual giving.

	Our current participation is about 8%. In addition to pride, loyalty and public rankings, here are some reasons to give back to Kelley:

Tuition does not cover the real cost of undergrad education - only 37% for Indiana residents and 68% for non-residents.  The rests depends on the generosity of alumni.
Kelley currently is only able to award 11% of our 5,000 undergrad students with scholarships.
Most gifts are restricted - towards scholarships, departments or programs. Unrestricted gifts (Kelley Shareholders Fund) provide vital flexibility.
Funding sources continue to decline - Kelley receives approx. 6% of our funding from the state.
Kelley's mission is global and our Network is immense - big ideas and effective solutions are expensive.
Every gift makes a difference - most gifts to Kelley are under $1,000, but consistent annual giving from more than 100,000 alumni makes a powerful impact, and increases the value of your Kelley degree.


	Show your support and satisfaction by making a gift to the Kelley School.

	Then, get in touch to discuss the resources available to you, get involved or share your feedback.

	Go Kelley!
