Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal fluctuate so your shares may be worth more or less when redeemed. Current performance may differ from the data shown. Adjusted returns reflect the maximum sales charge. Unadjusted returns do not reflect sales charges and would have been lower if they did.
To view the Net Asset Value (NAV) for a fund, please select the UNADJ option in the View Data drop down box below. Gross expense ratio is as of the latest prospectus. 
Quick and easy way to get what you need. Subscribe to our newest insights and information for timely updates.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the Prospectus
To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment product. Please read the summary prospectus and prospectus carefully before you invest.

Deutsche’s former head of structured product syndicate has just launched his own hedge fund

by Paul Clarke
11 July 2017

Former senior traders are leaving big banks to launch their own hedge funds. 

http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/289578/barclays-investment-bank-hiring-2017/



























There’s something in the water. Increasing numbers of senior bankers and traders are stepping out on their own, starting advisory boutiques, hedge funds or private equity firms. The latest example is Kevin Flaherty, the former head of structured product syndicate for Europe, Asia and Australia at Deutsche Bank, who has just launched his own hedge fund.
Flaherty, who has spent the last three years working at London-based hedge fund Scio Capital, has just launched a new fund called Neptune Capital, according to new filings on Companies House. So far, just Flaherty and Sebastian Stoecker, a former director in fixed income credit solutions at Credit Suisse who most recently worked for Scio Capital in investor relations and business development, focused on structured credit are the only employees. Neptune Capital is going against the recent trend of large UK hedge funds moving out of London’s Mayfair, and has set up its offices on Saville Row. It’s yet to receive authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority.
Flaherty spent 12 years at Deutsche Bank, having joined in 2001 from Barclays where he worked in asset backed securities (ABS) trading and research. He left the bank in 2012 to join Miami-based investment firm Trimast Capital, but returned to London in 2014 to join Scio Capital.
Neptune Capital is the latest new launch from former senior employees of bulge bracket investment banks who have decided to go it alone. David Perez, a former Goldman Sachs managing director who moved to expansionary hedge fund MKP Capital Management, recently launched an alternative lending platform called YAD Capital. Maxime Kahn, the former star SocGen trader who unwound €70bn worth of Jerome Kerviel’s trades in 2008, left the bank in November and unveiled his new hedge fund One Eleven Capital last week.
Senior bankers are also crowding into the boutique space and launching their own advisory firms. Nick Hassall, who was head of consumer investment banking at UBS, has started Sequor Partners Limited, while James Simpson, the former co-head of advisory for EMEA at HSBC, teamed up with Matteo Canonaco, the former head of financial sponsors, sovereign wealth funds and IPC coverage at the bank, to launch a private equity boutique called DuCanon Capital Partners

Deutsche’s former head of structured product syndicate has just launched his own hedge fund

Former senior traders are leaving big banks to launch their own hedge funds.

Flaherty spent 12 years at Deutsche Bank, having joined in 2001 from Barclays where he worked in asset backed securities (ABS) trading and research. He left the bank in 2012 to join Miami-based investment firm Trimast Capital, but returned to London in 2014 to join Scio Capital.
Neptune Capital is the latest new launch from former senior employees of bulge bracket investment banks who have decided to go it alone. David Perez, a former Goldman Sachs managing director who moved to expansionary hedge fund MKP Capital Management, recently launched an alternative lending platform called YAD Capital. Maxime Kahn, the former star SocGen trader who unwound €70bn worth of Jerome Kerviel’s trades in 2008, left the bank in November and unveiled his new hedge fund One Eleven Capital last week.
Senior bankers are also crowding into the boutique space and launching their own advisory firms. Nick Hassall, who was head of consumer investment banking at UBS, has started Sequor Partners Limited, while James Simpson, the former co-head of advisory for EMEA at HSBC, teamed up with Matteo Canonaco, the former head of financial sponsors, sovereign wealth funds and IPC coverage at the bank, to launch a private equity boutique called DuCanon Capital Partners
