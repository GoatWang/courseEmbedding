Janney has enhanced our online account access. 





Read below for a summary of the features and enhancements to our new site.
Featured Benefits
Recent Updates

A Refreshed Look & New Features for Janney Online Access
    Janney’s Online Access client portal has recently been refreshed. The navigation of the site has not changed, so you’ll still find your favorite features in the same place. We’ve also added the following new features:


Janney Money Transfer
    Janney Money Transfer lets you use Janney Online Access to transfer cash between your bank account and your Janney account, or between two Janney accounts. All it takes is a few clicks of a button. 

 Online Cash Transfer with Janney Money Transfer

Responsive Layout for Various Screen Sizes
    The site will now automatically scale to the appropriate screen size of the device being used—whether it’s a mobile phone, tablet, or PC. Clients using mobile devices will be presented with a clearer view of their information, with minimal distraction.

 Responsive Mobile View

MY NET WORTH Account Aggregation
    With My Net Worth, Janney’s account aggregation feature, clients can now set budgets for expenses, track progress toward future goals, analyze cash flow into and out of accounts, and request transfers of outside assets into Janney. Now, My Net Worth is an even better tool for tracking your entire net worth in one place.

 MY NET WORTH Overview

eDelivery
    Janney´s eDelivery service provides you the convenience of receiving electronic notification of the availability of your periodic statements and transaction confirmations via Online Access. It is a secure, convenient client service available to you.

 How to enroll in eDelivery

Research & Education
    The Research & Education tab opens a world of financial intelligence. Janney's newly added Investor Education section features easy-to-read articles, links and resources on financial topics including retirement, college, taxes, personal finance, and estate planning. Understand more about your college savings goals and project different spending and savings scenarios using Janney's College Savings Planner.

New Security Features
    You will now be asked to authenticate your online identity by providing the answers to security questions or by sending a single-use PIN code to your existing email address. You can also add an enhanced level of security by always requiring a PIN code. These security measures are only used when an unrecognized computer attempts to logon to your accounts.

​​

 

Key Sections of the Site
Portfolio & Accounts – Your Portal to Account Management
 
In this section of the site, you’ll find detailed information about your holdings, including balances and positions, capital gains and losses, pending and completed transactions, and estimated income. Click through the second row of tabs for a detailed picture of your portfolio’s holdings and activity. Do you want to know how many municipal bonds or biotech stocks you hold in your portfolio? The Balances & Positions page lets you sort your assets by sector, security type, and symbol—and quantity, price, and value. Want to make sure a trade went through before you go to bed? Want to check how much you made on a stock sale? View the Account Activity page.
Summary Page

The Summary page is your go-to location for information about your accounts.  You can check highlights of information that appears elsewhere in more detail. This gives you the big picture of your Janney accounts— the cash, securities, and balance of each account linked to your online access.

 
Account Selector Tool
If you have a number of accounts (for example, one for each family member or education savings accounts for each child), use the Account Selector to choose only those accounts you want to see on your Accounts Overview – a big time-saver, especially if some of your accounts are more active than others. Your view will update to list only the accounts you selected.


Research & Education

The Research & Education tab opens a world of financial intelligence, updated every 20 minutes. Janney and S&P research and commentary can help you make confident, educated investment choices. If you want to research an industry, a company, or a security, you can sort information by markets, quotes, news updates, summaries of major market indices, and charts. Look up details of a particular stock, and track historical performance of a given security.

Here, you’ll also find targeted, objective research by Janney’s analysts on hundreds of companies. Read how the brightest financial minds expect the markets, as well as political and economic horizons, to evolve.
The Investor Education section features easy-to-read articles, links, and resources on financial topics— including retirement, college, taxes, personal finance, and estate planning.

Fixed Income & CDs Fixed income investments can offer a regular source of income and stability which can help balance your portfolio. Whether you are new to bonds or a seasoned investor, your Janney Financial Advisor can coordinate the services of our Fixed Income Specialists and help determine the amount of fixed income exposure that’s appropriate for your needs.

“Janney is a firm that’s both employee and client friendly. Employees enjoy the culture of our firm and can feel confident working here because of our stable environment. Clients feel secure investing with us and seeking our advice because they know that we’re a successful firm who has been in business for over 175 years.” -- Todd Mitchell, Branch Manager & Financial Advisor, Baltimore MD





Grounded in the Past
Janney's focus has been, and will continue to be, the long-term success of our clients and Financial Advisors.  Our history of over 175 years gives us the knowledge to understand that even turbulent market cycles can and will be weathered when a long-term perspective and focus is maintained.
We have time-tested history of financial stability, with a strong equity capital base and ownership by the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company. Our relationship with Penn Mutual is over 25 years old and allows us the independence to operate our business privately and securely.
Both Janney and Penn Mutual have a conservative operating model, and combined with an unbroken string of profitable years, we continue to uphold our commitment to our clients and Financial Advisors.

Focused on the Future
We know that the success of our business depends on the expertise our Financial Advisors provide their clients for the future, it also depends on the plans Firm management oversees and implements to continue Janney’s success in future years. 
Among our many ongoing commitments to our financial professionals, we will continue to provide our Financial Advisors with access to numerous professional development opportunities, thought leadership and the resources needed to grow their practices. We remain committed to adding to our team of Financial Advisors on an ongoing basis. We empower our employees to deliver outstanding service, advice and innovative ideas to clients, work in a resourceful and relationship-based culture, be active community participants and continue building a financially strong and profitable business. 
Our business plans for the future include continued delivery of:

Expertise and state-of-the art products from our Wealth Management team
Experienced support from corporate partners and professionals at our Philadelphia headquarters

Our Size and Scale:  The Right Firm for the Right Advisor

A Message from Jim Dornan, Western Regional ManagerUndoubtedly, the past few years have presented many challenges to those of us in the financial services industry. In addition to the markets' unprecedented volatility, many firms have gone through ownership and leadership changes while decreasing service to clients and forcing advisors, in many cases, to work harder than ever for less.Perhaps you recently found yourself at a point in your career where you are considering the possibility of making a change – one that will put you in a position to better serve your clients, once again be proud of the firm you represent and work in an environment where your contributions are appreciated. If you are serious about these benefits and about working for a traditional retail brokerage firm where the client, and the advisor's relationship with the client, comes first, then I invite you to learn more about Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. Why Janney is Unique:
Janney is a 185-year old, privately-held, regional brokerage firm700+ advisors in more than 100 offices in 17 states primarily along the east cost, Janney intends to remain a true regional firmEighty percent of Janney's revenue is from retail operationsThe Private Client Group senior leadership team all started in the business as retail advisorsJanney has a Financial Advisor Council and Branch Manager Council to ensure consistent, client-focused input from our professionals in the branchesJanney is free of the bureaucracy that is plaguing so many of our peer's firms

I have worked in the financial services industry over 25 years, and while change is a part of our business, how we work together, treat each other and most importantly, how we serve our clients, should remain the same. If you are considering a change and would like to learn more about Janney and this opportunity, I would enjoy the opportunity to talk with you.
Please contact me directly at 410.580.2689 or email me for a confidential discussion today.

Janney Montgomery Scott LLC

When Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, a leading full-service wealth management, financial services, and investment banking firm, relocated to its new, state-of-the-art headquarters in downtown Philadelphia, the firm worked with STUDIOS Architecture and Knoll to design space and select furnishings that support a long-term business plan and growth strategy.
The firm's Reff Profiles™ private offices balance a traditional design with efficient technology support. Reff Profiles™ Sliding Tables and Krusin Side Chairs transform private offices into collaborative spaces as needed.
Open plan workstations feature the refined aesthetic of Reff Profiles™ paired with the design flexibility, and power and data management of AutoStrada® Spine Wall. Together, Reff Profiles™ and AutoStrada® offer a flexible solution to meet business objectives. A uniformed wood palette and custom metal accents suggest visual connections between open plan and private offices.
Gigi® Chairs in Activity Spaces adjacent to primary workspaces allow employees to easily transition between focused work and group work. Life® Chairs, used throughout the space, feature a slim silhouette and responsive movement that set the standard for design and comfort.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
