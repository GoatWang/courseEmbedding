Please visit the Manage E-Bill page to take advantage of our paperless billing service.








Where do I view my bill and billing history online?






Please visit the Account Information page to view and pay your current bill. Past bills can be found in your Account History.  








What are your rates?






Visit the Rates & Tariffs section of our website for a breakdown and explanation of natural gas and electricity rates.








Can I choose another company to supply my energy?






Yes, Eversource customers have the option of choosing a competitive energy supplier. If you choose an alternate supplier, Eversource will still deliver power to your home, read your meter, care for the poles and wires, provide customer service, and restore power when there is a service interruption. Learn more about evaluating and choosing alternate energy suppliers and see a list of current offers available from suppliers.












How do I report a power outage?






You can report an outage online. After doing so, you'll be able to check in on the status of your outage. You can also sign up for outage alerts via text, phone and email.








Where can I view the Outage Map?






The Outage Map on our website provides details on any outages in your area, and is updated every 15 minutes.








How long will it take to restore my power?






Individual times of restoration depend on the overall damage to substations, and where homes are located along our system. Learn more about our restoration process.








How do I report a streetlight is out?






Some public streetlights are maintained by Eversource, while others are handled by the town itself. Find out if Eversource maintains your streetlight, and if we do, you can submit a streetlight repair request.








How do I report a claim?






If you have suffered a loss and believe Eversource may be responsible, please fill out our online application or contact the Eversource Claims Department at 844-685-4475.












What areas does Eversource serve?






As New England’s largest energy delivery company, Eversource serves more than 3.6 million electric and natural gas customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. See a list of our service territory.








How do I start, stop or transfer residential service?






You can start, stop or transfer  service.








Do I need to be present to have my gas or electric service turned on?






For gas, someone over the age of 18 must be present at the time of service set up. 
For electric, there is no need to be present at the time of service set up unless, the meter is located inside.








How do I submit my I.D. verification on the web?






If you need to send important documentation to Eversource, such as proof of identity, you can use our Secure Document Transfer. You will receive a notification when the verification process is complete. Read our full Privacy Statement to understand how we gather and use information.












Do Eversource employees carry a badge with them at all times?






Yes, all Eversource employees carry clearly visible company-issued identification, and any electrical contractors working with us carry documentation explaining the nature and location of their work. Learn more about how to protect yourself from scams.








Does Eversource send employees door-to-door asking to see my bill?






Eversource does not solicit door-to-door or on the phone on behalf of third-party energy suppliers.
Eversource representatives always carry company-issued photo identification and will always provide it when asked.
Eversource almost never makes unsolicited house visits. Exceptions might include accessing, maintaining, or ensuring the reliable and safe operation of our equipment.
If you’re not sure the person is an Eversource employee, call us. We’ll be glad to verify if work is scheduled at or near your home or business and the identity of the employee.








What types of scams should I look out for?






Many scam artists threaten customers in person, over the phone and online with disconnection of their electric or natural gas service if they don’t make an immediate payment. Another tactic is to offer a bill credit or discounted rate if a customer provides their account number or other information. Learn more about how to protect yourself from scams.








What should I do if I feel I’ve been scammed?






Report any incidents of potential fraud or identity theft to local law enforcement and the Federal Trade Commission at 877-382-4357. Please also call us to report any potential scam activity or if you believe you are the target of improper solicitation. Learn more about how to protect yourself from scams.












How can I lower my bill?






Visit our Save Money & Energy pages for information on ways to lower your bill, including rebates and incentives and seasonal energy-saving tips. We also offer discounted rates and other financial assistance for qualifying customers.








What is Energy Savings Plan?






Energy Savings Plan is an exciting tool available to Eversource customers that provides energy information and resources specifically customized to you. Based on your account information and the answers you provide to a few brief questions, we can help you better understand how you are currently using energy before providing energy-saving recommendations.








Do I qualify for financial assistance?






We understand that there are times we all face financial hardship and need support. Qualifying Eversource customers can take advantage of our Financial Assistance programs such as fuel assistance, discounted rates, payment plans and more.












How do I reset my User ID?






If you are having trouble logging on to your account, you can reset your User ID or password online.








I am a new Eversource customer. Why can’t I see my bill when I log on to my account?






You can view your first bill online 30-45 days from the day your service started. View a typical residential bill for an explanation of each section.












Why does Eversource trim trees?






In an effort to provide safe, reliable electricity with minimal service interruptions, we continuously monitor wires and equipment, periodically trimming around the power lines. Learn more about why Eversource trims trees.








How do I request Tree Trimming or track service request?






You can request a tree-trimming online and track service request.








Why wasn't my request completed?






If our Vegetation Management team determines that the affected line is not electrical, you will need to call the cable or phone company as appropriate. Check the status of your request online to see if there are any comments from our Vegetation Management team.

Website

NSTAR was a utility company that provided retail electricity and natural gas to 1.4 million customers in eastern and central Massachusetts, including the Boston urban area. NSTAR became a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities in April 2012. In February 2015, Northeast Utilities and all of its operating companies (Public Service New Hampshire, Connecticut Light and Power, Yankee Gas, and NSTAR Gas and Electric) became one large company known as Eversource Energy.
NSTAR was formed in 1999 by the merger of BEC Energy and Commonwealth Energy System and currently has the following operating units: Boston Edison Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, Commonwealth Electric Company, and NSTAR Gas Company (formerly Commonwealth Gas and Cambridge Gas Company).
As a part of deregulation of the local electrical power industry, NSTAR has divested itself of all electric generation facilities, keeping only those elements of the business which remain regulated. NSTAR sold its interest in the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant to FPL Group in 2002.
On November 16, 2006, the company announced a 7.4% increase in its dividend to an annual rate of USD1.30 per common share from the previous USD1.21.[1]
NSTAR has ownership of unregulated district energy and telecommunications businesses, including Medical Area Total Energy Plant, LLC. which produces electricity, steam and chilled water for sale to customers in the Longwood Medical Area of Boston.
Electric power distribution in the New England area is coordinated by ISO New England, a regional transmission organization.

Environmental record[edit]
In 2002, NSTAR Electric and Gas Corporation was cited by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for discharging oil into the Charles River. The EPA also stated that NSTAR had failed to prepare spill plans at four of its facilities, in Brighton, Cambridge, Needham, and West Roxbury, where oil is pumped through their pipe lines.[2] In July 2007, NSTAR Electric introduced a new program called NSTAR Green. In May 2008, NSTAR Green signed ten-year contracts for sixty megawatts of wind power from two wind farms in New York and Maine. They offered their customers a chance to buy 50-100 percent of their power from these wind farms.[3] Power purchased through NSTAR Green would reduce reliance on fossil fuels that are traditionally used to meet the region’s electricity demand.[4]
PCB spill controversy[edit]
NSTAR has had its share of environmental mishaps, including nearly a dozen spills at its former Watertown, Massachusetts facility. The spills, most of which occurred during the 1980s, consisted of transformer oil, which contained PCBs in high concentrations (6,200 Parts Per million). These spills have contaminated nearby Sawins and Williams Pond, both of which are downgradient of the NSTAR facility, and possibly flowed into the Charles river, which is downstream of Sawins Pond. Many local activists lobbied for NSTAR to abide by state regulations and spend the $20–40 million required to perform a PCB remediation of the affected lands. By 1997 NSTAR was responsible for nearly 50 hazardous waste sites, and by 2006 all but 5 of these had been cleaned up.[5]
HVDC transmission[edit]
NSTAR has signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and Northeast Utilities to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec - New England Transmission line) to a location in central New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[6]
Merger with Northeast Utilities[edit]
In October 2010, Northeast Utilities and NSTAR announced they would merge, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name. Under the terms of the transaction, NSTAR shareholders will receive 1.312 Northeast Utilities common shares for each NSTAR share that they own.[7] The merger was completed in 2012.[8] On February 2, 2015, Northeast Utilities and all its subsidiaries, including NSTAR, began to brand themselves as "Eversource Energy".[9][10]

NSTAR was a utility company that provided retail electricity and natural gas to 1.4 million customers in eastern and central Massachusetts, including the Boston urban area. NSTAR became a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities in April 2012. In February 2015, Northeast Utilities and all of its operating companies (Public Service New Hampshire, Connecticut Light and Power, Yankee Gas, and NSTAR Gas and Electric) became one large company known as Eversource Energy.
NSTAR was formed in 1999 by the merger of BEC Energy and Commonwealth Energy System and currently has the following operating units: Boston Edison Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, Commonwealth Electric Company, and NSTAR Gas Company (formerly Commonwealth Gas and Cambridge Gas Company).
As a part of deregulation of the local electrical power industry, NSTAR has divested itself of all electric generation facilities, keeping only those elements of the business which remain regulated. NSTAR sold its interest in the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant to FPL Group in 2002.
On November 16, 2006, the company announced a 7.4% increase in its dividend to an annual rate of USD1.30 per common share from the previous USD1.21.[1]
NSTAR has ownership of unregulated district energy and telecommunications businesses, including Medical Area Total Energy Plant, LLC. which produces electricity, steam and chilled water for sale to customers in the Longwood Medical Area of Boston.
Electric power distribution in the New England area is coordinated by ISO New England, a regional transmission organization.

Environmental record[edit]
In 2002, NSTAR Electric and Gas Corporation was cited by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for discharging oil into the Charles River. The EPA also stated that NSTAR had failed to prepare spill plans at four of its facilities, in Brighton, Cambridge, Needham, and West Roxbury, where oil is pumped through their pipe lines.[2] In July 2007, NSTAR Electric introduced a new program called NSTAR Green. In May 2008, NSTAR Green signed ten-year contracts for sixty megawatts of wind power from two wind farms in New York and Maine. They offered their customers a chance to buy 50-100 percent of their power from these wind farms.[3] Power purchased through NSTAR Green would reduce reliance on fossil fuels that are traditionally used to meet the region’s electricity demand.[4]
PCB spill controversy[edit]
NSTAR has had its share of environmental mishaps, including nearly a dozen spills at its former Watertown, Massachusetts facility. The spills, most of which occurred during the 1980s, consisted of transformer oil, which contained PCBs in high concentrations (6,200 Parts Per million). These spills have contaminated nearby Sawins and Williams Pond, both of which are downgradient of the NSTAR facility, and possibly flowed into the Charles river, which is downstream of Sawins Pond. Many local activists lobbied for NSTAR to abide by state regulations and spend the $20–40 million required to perform a PCB remediation of the affected lands. By 1997 NSTAR was responsible for nearly 50 hazardous waste sites, and by 2006 all but 5 of these had been cleaned up.[5]
HVDC transmission[edit]
NSTAR has signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and Northeast Utilities to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec - New England Transmission line) to a location in central New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes.[6]

Under the terms of the transaction, NSTAR shareholders will receive 1.312 Northeast Utilities common shares for each NSTAR share that they own.[7] The merger was completed in 2012.[8] On February 2, 2015, Northeast Utilities and all its subsidiaries, including NSTAR, began to brand themselves as "Eversource Energy".[9][10]
