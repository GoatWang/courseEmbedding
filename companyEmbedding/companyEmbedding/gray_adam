Masonry / Grey Block








Redline®
Adams' Redline blended lightweight masonry is a successful time-tested product which is identified by a visible red strip running vertically on the end of the block. This distinctive feature allows quick confirmation that the product being used in the wall is indeed the fire-rated product specified.

Redline has an average weight of 28 pounds per 8x8x16 unit. It combines the insulation and productivity advantages of lightweight concrete with the strength of standard masonry units. Redline also offers advantages in reduced chippage, consistent color and texture with a smooth surface that requires less painting for an even top coat.

Greenline®

Concrete solutions are sustainable solutions which can provide you with exceptional GREEN BUILDINGS. For over 15 years Adams Products has been providing recycled concrete masonry units and recycling or salvaging construction waste as a better way to utilize our resources. The material has been available in the residential market for over 15 years. It was introduced to the commercial market in 1997. The EPA Headquarters at RTP, NC was built with Recycled Lightweight Concrete Masonry Units. Over 1,000,000 units were used for this project. Also on this project we introduced the jobsite recycling program. This project was considered a prototype for the federal government and HOK Architects.


If you are looking for Innovative and Environmentally Friendly Masonry Solutions utilize GREENLINE 31 CONCRETE MASONRY UNITS and GREENLINE RECYCLING PROGRAM for your next LEEDŽ project.

  Product description:
  Rooster Farm Gray is an eclectic style artwork crafted from high-grade, rust-proof white aluminum for a lightweight body and indoor/outdoor versatility. It is part of the latest series of nature-themed contemporary metal giclĂŠe prints by Cincinnati artist Adam Schwoeppe. With all of the debate surrounding climate change, global warming, habitate encroachment, poaching, and hunting, this line of animal silhouette art is our artistic way of encouraging animal preservation and issuing a reminder of the beauty of Mother Nature and the global efforts needed to preserve Her. 

The acrylic inks are applied directly to the metallic surface in crisp hues of black, white, light grey, and charcoal with lightly textured contrast between the semi-gloss white and the satin matte colors. It is designed to be an eye-catching way of decorating with a focus on western. The unexpected industrial materials and durable finishes make this animal silhouette a popular choice for everything from upscale hotels to harmonious day spas to modern corporate offices. This unique hybrid/fusion between landscape photography and rooster barn art is a creative addition to our Western Wildlife/Nature Decor collection.

Adam's 4" Gray Foam Pad (2 Pack)
The perfect pad for applying Adam's Liquid Paint Sealant or any liquid wax product with your polisher.

Adam's 6th Generation Foam Pad System
For Use With 4" Hook & Loop Backing Plates
Ultra-Fine Foam Designed to Apply Liquid Sealants or Waxes
Applies a Thin Even Coating for Maximum Results
Made in the USA

 

As machine polishers have advanced, so have the demands of the pads that attach to them. Adam’s is proud to introduce our Generation 6 Foam Pad System.
Each aspect of the pad design has been carefully considered to deliver maximum performance, durability, and results. Featuring a high-grip velcro backing for maximum adhesion and minimal pad slip, these pads will hold tighter to your machine reducing the chances of an errant pad or mid-polishing delamination in even the most extreme conditions. We listened to feedback and eliminated the neoprene mid-base section that some users found difficult to avoid putting rubber transfer marks onto the vehicle surface if the side of the pad was accidentally bumped against a panel, which could cause a scare and be somewhat difficult to remove. The convoluted face generates less heat, and the tapered edge design provides stability and smoothness for the Cyclo Model 5 polisher. They now have a lower price too!
Color coordinated to Adam's Liquid Paint Sealant, the Adam's 4" Gray Foam Sealant and Waxing pad was specifically designed to apply a thin, even, coating of our premium sealant in order to maximize results. The non-abrasive foam compound keeps liquids on the surface of the pad reducing wasted product and keeping your pads easy to clean. The convoluted face provides smooth and complete surface contact reducing the chances of high spots promoting faster product cure times and more even finishing. The Adam's 4" Gray Foam Pads are perfect not only for applying our Liquid Paint Sealant, but also our Buttery Wax, or any liquid wax you prefer.  
Extensive testing and development was done to make sure that each aspect of the Adam's 6th Generation foam pad system maximized performance on a variety of polishers, so no matter what tool you choose to use, rest assured that you'll see maximum performance. The Adam's 4" Gray Foam Sealing and Waxing Pads work perfect with the Cyclo Model 5 Pro Mark II.

Product Description▼▲
In today's culture wars both sides are utterly convinced that they know God's will---and to give in an inch is to surrender. Adam Hamilton explains how the gospel is neither politically conservative nor liberal, Republican nor Democrat; he probes instead the true meaning of discipleship and spiritual maturity in a divided world. Five-session DVD, approx. 97 minutes.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Everyone agrees that America is polarized, with ever-hardening positions held by people less and less willing to listen to one another. No one agrees on what to do about it. One solution that hasnt yet been tried, says Adam Hamilton, is for thinking persons of faith to model for the rest of the country a richer, more thoughtful conversation on the political, moral, and religious issues that divide us.  Offering insights first outlined in his book,  Seeing Gray in a World of Black and White, now comes a video resource featuring Adam Hamilton teaching these concepts on DVD for group or individual study. Includes leader's guide and bonus video segments.   Adam Hamilton is pastor of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas, one of the countrys most dynamic and distinctive congregations. He is the author of several books, including  Confronting the Controversies: Biblical Perspectives on Tough Issues and Making Love Last a Lifetime, also published by Abingdon Press.


Author Bio▼▲
Adam Hamilton is senior pastor of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas, one of the fastest growing, most highly visible churches in the country.
