Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

                                         and its midstream subsidiary, Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. ("APL"), entered into definitive agreements to be acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP, respectively. Immediately prior to the acquisition, Atlas Energy will distribute to its unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, which has changed its name to Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("New Atlas") and will become a separate, publicly traded company as a result of the distribution. New Atlas will hold all of Atlas Energy's non-midstream holdings, which includes the Partnership's business as well as the general partner interest, incentive distribution rights and Atlas Energy's limited partner interest in ARP.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy, for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  · well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  · reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  · preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of September 30, 2014, our MGP withheld $139,400 of net production revenue for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and 2013, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs, and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 1,004 $ 1,468 $ 4,491 $ 4,858 Oil 109 204 396 564 Total $ 1,113 $ 1,672 $ 4,887 $ 5,422 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 4,012 4,850 4,098 4,591 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 21 26 16 23 Total (mcfe/day) (1) 4,138 5,006 4,194 4,729 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) (5) $ 3.14 $ 3.39 $ 4.07 $ 4.04 Oil (per bbl) (1) (4) $ 91.76 $ 87.18 $ 92.13 $ 91.37 Production costs: As a percent of revenues (5) 79 % 62 % 63 % 60 % Per mcfe (1) $ 2.58 $ 2.26 $ 2.67 $ 2.52 Depletion per mcfe $ 0.83 $ 1.40 $ 0.79 $ 1.57  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $20,400 and $45,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Previously recognized derivative gains were $59,600 and $209,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  (4) Average oil prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $1,400 and $7,100 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013.  (5) The average sales price and production costs as a percent of revenues for the natural gas for the three months ended September 30, 2014 has been adjusted to reflect $134,000 of additional revenues. See Item 4: Controls and Procedures for additional information.  Natural Gas Revenues. During the current year quarter, management identified a material weakness in the process used to estimate our unbilled revenue (see item 4:Controls and Procedures). As a result, natural gas revenue for the three months ending September 30, 2014 includes an adjustment to reduce natural gas revenue by $134,000. The adjustment is the result of overestimating our unbilled revenues as of June 30, 2014. Our unadjusted natural gas revenues were $1,137,800 and $1,468,300 for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $330,500 (23%). The $330,500 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $253,600 decrease in production volumes and a $76,900 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 4,012 mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2014 from 4,850 mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of 838 mcf per day (17%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Our natural gas revenues were $4,490,700 and $4,858,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $367,600 (8%). The $367,600 decrease in natural gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $521,300 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $153,700 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, including the reversal of $59,600 and $209,000 previously recognized derivative gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our production volumes decreased to 4,098 mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from 4,591 mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of 493 mcf per day (11%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $109,200 and $203,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $94,500 (46%). The $94,500 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $100,700 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $6,200 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 21 bbls per day for the three months ended September 30, 2014 from 26 bbls per day for the three months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of 5 bbls per day (19%).  Our oil revenues were $395,900 and $563,900 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $168,000 (30%). The $168,000 decrease in oil revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to an $176,100 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $8,100 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 16 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from 23 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of 7 bbls per day (30%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $982,400 and $1,043,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $60,800 (6%). Production expenses were $3,058,800 and $3,250,400 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $191,600 (6%). The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 was mostly due to a decrease in supervision fees and water hauling expenses.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 28% and 39% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and 18% and 37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These changes are primarily attributable to changes in oil and gas reserve quantities and to a lesser extent, revenues, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 were $125,000 and $131,600, respectively, a decrease of $6,600 (5%). For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 these expenses were $369,800 and $396,500, respectively, a decrease of $26,700 (7%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $227,900 in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $1,668,900 as compared to $1,896,800 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income before depletion and accretion of $317,300, a decrease in the change in a non-cash loss on hedge instruments of $270,600 and a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $139,400. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $482,200, an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of $15,900, and an increase in the change in asset retirement obligations settled of $1,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013.  Cash used in investing activities was $79,900 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, representing the net of $10,300 in the proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $90,200 for the purchase of tangible equipment. Cash provided by investing activities was $8,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 representing the proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $230,300 during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $1,845,400 from $2,075,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This increase was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas Resources Public #16-2007 (A) L.P.("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on September 15, 2006 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  · well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  · reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  · preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of March 31, 2014, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and 2013, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 2013 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 1,805 $ 1,467 Oil 108 146 Total $ 1,913 $ 1,613 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 3,920 4,568 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 13 19 Total (mcfe/day) (1) 3,998 4,682 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) $ 5.17 $ 3.75 Oil (per bbl) (1) $ 90.46 $ 88.79 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 52 % 66 % Per mcfe (1) $ 2.78 $ 2.53 Depletion per mcfe $ 0.79 $ 1.58  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $17,900 and $73,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $1,804,900 and $1,467,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $337,800 (23%). The $337,800 increase in natural gas revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $546,100 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, partially offset by a $208,300 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 3,920 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2014 from 4,568 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013, a decrease of 648 mcf per day (14%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $108,400 and $146,300 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $37,900 (25%). The $37,900 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $43,900 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $6,000 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 13 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2014 from 19 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013, a decrease of 6 bbls per day (32%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $1,002,000 and $1,065,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $63,200 (5%). This decrease was mostly attributable to decreases in operating fees.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 14% and 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were $124,300 and $136,600, respectively, a decrease of $12,300 (9%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three months ended March 31, 2014 is primarily due to a decrease in third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $317,800 in the three months ended March 31, 2014 to $389,600 as compared to $707,400 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $623,900 and a decrease of a net non-cash loss on hedge instruments of $99,200. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in net earnings before depletion and accretion of $375,400 and an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of $28,300, for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013.  Cash provided by investing activities was $4,400 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This was due to the net proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities increased $70,700 during the three months ended March 31, 2014 to $646,000 from $575,300 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com
