      for Hitachi Data Systems, Acer Corporation and Pricewaterhousecoopers 
      LLP.

      Laura Ipsen as an independent director to our Board," said Hugh Grant, 
      Monsanto's chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. 
      "Laura's experience will enable her to provide valuable insight to our 
      board on a variety of matters, including information technology and key 
      legislative and regulatory issues facing our global technology business, 
      as well as strategic oversight of our sustainability efforts."
    

      Ipsen's appointment is effective immediately, and she will stand for 
      election to the Board at the 2011 annual meeting of shareowners. Ipsen 
      will serve on the Science and Technology Committee and the 
      Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee.

      to 12, with 11 independent directors. Additional information about Ipsen
