Dr. Anthony F. Ceddia named President EmeritusBy:
							  Kenn Marshall, (717) 720-4054 or (717) 329-08092005-04-14T04:00:00ZThe Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education’s Board of Governors has conferred the status of president emeritus upon longtime Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania President Anthony F. Ceddia, who plans to retire in June.
Dr. Ceddia was named president of what was then Shippensburg State College in August 1981. He is the longest currently serving president in the State System.
Since his tenure began, approximately 34,000 students have been graduated from Shippensburg, which became Shippensburg University upon the establishment of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) on July 1, 1983.
“Shippensburg University is a great place for students, in large part because of Tony Ceddia’s leadership and his commitment to excellence on behalf of students,” said PASSHE Chancellor Judy G. Hample, in recommending Dr. Ceddia for emeritus status.
The leadership Dr. Ceddia has provided to the University and to PASSHE has been invaluable, Dr. Hample said.
“Dr. Ceddia was here when the System began, and has been instrumental in PASSHE’s growth and development,” Dr. Hample said. “His thoughtful counsel has helped shape many of the policies and practices that have enabled PASSHE and our universities to grow in academic stature.”
Dr. Ceddia has been a leader among and a mentor to his fellow PASSHE University presidents, having chaired both the Commission of Presidents and the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference. He also has chaired the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities, and has held numerous leadership positions with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, including vice chair of the NCAA’s Commission of Presidents for Division II institutions.
He has helped bring prestige and recognition to PASSHE by chairing university reaccredidation teams for both the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges and the Western Association of Schools & Colleges.
“Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and, most importantly, our students, all have benefited greatly from Dr. Ceddia’s extraordinary leadership and his commitment to quality education,” said Board Chairman Charles A. Gomulka. “His service will be missed.”
To be eligible for emeritus status, an individual must have spent at least 10 continuous years in his or her leadership position and have shown “an exemplary record of service through the demonstrated commitments of time, talent and resources” to PASSHE.
With nearly 106,000 students, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education is the largest provider of higher education in the Commonwealth. The 14 PASSHE universities offer more than 250 degree and certificate programs in more than 120 areas of study.  Nearly 400,000 PASSHE alumni live and work in Pennsylvania.
The state-owned universities are Bloomsburg, California, Cheyney, Clarion, East Stroudsburg, Edinboro, Indiana, Kutztown, Lock Haven, Mansfield, Millersville, Shippensburg, Slippery Rock, and West Chester Universities of Pennsylvania. PASSHE also operates branch campuses in Clearfield, Kittanning, Oil City and Punxsutawney and several regional centers, including the Dixon University Center in Harrisburg.
