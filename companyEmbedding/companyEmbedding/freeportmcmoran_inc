 Copper is an internationally traded commodity,  and its price is effectively determined by the major metals exchanges — the  London Metal Exchange (LME), the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX) and   the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Prices on these exchanges generally  reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand, and can be volatile  and cyclical. In general, demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying  world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and construction.  According to Wood Mackenzie, a widely followed independent metals market  consultant, copper’s end-use markets (and their estimated shares of total  consumption) are construction (31 percent), consumer products (24 percent),  electrical applications (24 percent), transportation (11 percent) and  industrial machinery (10 percent). 
Copper’s physical attributes include superior  electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, structural capability, efficient  heat transfer and aesthetics. Other materials that compete with copper include  aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Substitution of competing  materials has been modest because it is difficult to duplicate copper’s unique  characteristics.
Copper consumption is closely associated with  industrial production, and therefore, tends to follow economic cycles. During  an expansion, demand for copper tends to increase, thereby driving up the  price. As a result, copper prices are volatile and cyclical.
We are one of the world's leading producers of  copper concentrate, cathode and continuous cast copper rod.
Copper Concentrate. Copper concentrate is a dry powder that is used as a feedstock for smelters. We supply it to our own smelters and to third party smelters. 
Copper Cathode. Copper cathode is used as the raw material input for continuous cast copper rod and for brass mill products. 
Continuous Cast Copper Rod. Copper rod is used as feedstock to produce electrical wire, cable and other products. Freeport-McMoRan is the largest manufacturer of continuous-cast copper rod in the world.

FCX leads the North America metals industry in the production  of copper and molybdenum. In North America, FCX currently operates seven  open-pit copper mines — Morenci, Bagdad, Sierrita, Safford and Miami in  Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico, and two molybdenum mines —  Henderson and Climax in Colorado. Certain of FCX’s North America copper mines  also produce molybdenum concentrates and silver.  
We have seven operating copper mines in North America —  Morenci, Bagdad, Sierrita, Miami and Safford in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone  in New Mexico. Our North America copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide  ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW)  operations. A majority of the copper produced at our North America copper mines  is cast into copper rod by our rod and refining operations, which consist of  copper conversion facilities including a smelter, refinery, rod mill and a  specialty copper products facility. Our North America copper mines also ship a  portion of their copper concentrate to Atlantic Copper, our wholly owned copper  smelting and refining unit in Spain.
The Morenci mill expansion project, which commenced  operations in May 2014, successfully achieved full rates in second-quarter  2015. The project expanded mill capacity from 50,000 metric tons of ore per day  to approximately 115,000 metric tons of ore per day, which results in  incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper and  an improvement in Morenci's cost structure. Over the next five years, Morenci's  copper production, including our joint venture partner share, is expected to  average approximately one billion pounds per year.
FCX is the world’s largest producer of molybdenum and  molybdenum-based chemicals. In addition to production from our Henderson and  Climax molybdenum mines, we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of our  North America copper mines, and at our Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru.

Better Buy: Freeport-McMoRan Inc. vs. Alcoa
Which mining and metals company looks better? Find out here.











                Dan Caplinger
            

                (TMFGalagan)



            
            Jun 21, 2017 at 5:10PM
            
            





For investors in natural resources, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Alcoa (NYSE:AA) have taken different angles at the broader industry. Freeport-McMoRan has gone through several transformative moves over its history, starting as an integrated natural resources company, later spinning off energy assets to become a mining specialist, and then later reintegrating its oil and gas exposure through acquisition to become a larger natural-resources play. Meanwhile, Alcoa is now focused solely on its base-metals business after spinning off its engineered products division as a separate publicly traded company.
Now that markets are rebounding, investors are looking to find out whether Freeport or Alcoa is the better pick. Let's look at the two companies to see how they stack up based on a number of popular metrics.
Stock performance and valuation
Freeport-McMoRan and Alcoa have moved in different directions recently. Alcoa is up 36% since June 2016, but Freeport-McMoRan has eased downward, falling 2% over the past 12 months.
From a valuation standpoint, it's tough to evaluate Freeport or Alcoa based on recent earnings. That's because both companies have had depressed bottom lines as they recover from long downturns in their respective industries. Currently, Freeport has a trailing earnings multiple of 60, while Alcoa's has soared into the triple digits. That makes the numbers less than completely meaningful.
Assessing the two companies on a forward basis is simpler. Based on future earnings projections, Freeport trades at a forward earnings multiple of less than nine. Alcoa's price of about 13 times forward earnings is also attractive, but it isn't enough to match the copper and gold miner and energy company. Despite its poor stock performance, Freeport looks like the better bet from a valuation perspective.

Dividends
Neither Freeport-McMoRan nor Alcoa pays a dividend currently. Each of the companies has a history of making dividend payments to shareholders, but recent tough times forced them to take a closer look at their dividend policies and make adjustments in order to adapt to adverse conditions.
Freeport hasn't paid a dividend in a couple of years, corresponding to when crude oil started to plunge. Freeport continues to face challenges in its core businesses, and even though conditions have gotten better across the commodities markets, the recent price drop in crude is just the latest reminder that gains can quickly reverse themselves. Nevertheless, some hope that a recovery for the natural resources stock last year might signal an ability to pay a dividend again in the near future.
Alcoa, meanwhile, is in a position in which it needs to figure out how to adapt to its new corporate structure. Alcoa's previous dividend was relatively small, and financing needs connected to the spinoff required the continuing entity to retain more capital. Earlier this year, Alcoa's chief financial officer said that restoring a dividend will require reducing leverage levels, and that will take time to achieve. Even once things get better, though, Alcoa could choose stock buybacks or a special dividend rather than instituting a regular quarterly dividend.
For now, investors can't expect any dividend income from either stock in the near future. It'll take much better conditions for Freeport or Alcoa to start paying out money again.





Growth prospects and risk
The main challenge that Freeport-McMoRan and Alcoa face is that, while conditions in their industries have improved, they haven't gotten back to normal. Freeport has had to deal with the ongoing tug of war in the energy markets, as oil has recently fallen back below the $45 per-barrel level. Weak fundamentals in the market for crude suggests that further downside is possible, and that would only exacerbate the problems that have led to massive impairment charges for Freeport assets.
Meanwhile, Freeport hopes that its copper and gold business can gain ground, but the Indonesian government is still a potential impediment as it seeks to put more restrictions and collect more taxes on the miner's most important mining asset. It will take sustained gains in the commodities markets for Freeport to get back to its best possible growth trajectory.
Alcoa has benefited so far from its move to split off its value-add engineered products unit, as the base metals part of the business has done well. Alcoa has worked hard to cut back on expenses, and early signs suggest that the efforts are paying off with better income figures. Low-cost foreign rivals are still a problem that Alcoa has to surmount, and the company has substantial obligations that it will have to fund over the long run. However, as demand for lower-weight metals increases, Alcoa is likely to become even more important to the overall economic recovery.
Overall, Alcoa looks like the better buy right now, even with its recent share-price gains. Freeport is too dependent on the volatile energy market, while Alcoa can count on being able to do better once levels of activity in the industrial economy perk up. Freeport will reach its full potential only if energy bounces back sharply.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]




Freeport Sulphur No.6 entering Freeport, Texas, harbor, 1923


The company was founded as the Texas Freeport Sulphur Company in 1912 as a sulfur mining company in Freeport, Texas.[13]
In 1928, concerned that the management of the company was not moving aggressively to increase reserves, 25-year old investor Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr. collaborated with Payne Whitney to launch a proxy fight and gain control of the company.[14]
Freeport pioneered mining sulphur at mines along the US Gulf Coast using the Frasch Process.[15]
The company began to diversify in 1931, purchasing manganese deposits in Oriente Province, Cuba.[16]
1950s[edit]
The company produced nickel during World War II and potash in the 1950s.[17]
In 1955, Freeport invested $119 million in constructing a nickel-cobalt mine at Moa Bay, Cuba, and a refinery at Port Nickel, Louisiana. On March 11, 1957, the U.S. government announced a contract to buy Freeport nickel and cobalt from Cuba until June 30, 1965, as strategic commodities. Fidel Castro's government nationalized the Cuban facility in 1960.[18]
In 1956, the company formed Freeport Oil Company.[17]
In 1958, the company sold an oil discovery near Lake Washington in Louisiana for approximately $100 million to Magnolia Petroleum Company.[17]
1960s[edit]
In 1961, the company entered the kaolin business after purchasing the assets of Southern Clays Inc.[17]
In 1964, the company formed Freeport of Australia to pursue mining opportunities there and in the surrounding Pacific Ocean region.[17]
Development of the Ertsberg deposit[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
In 1960, Freeport geologists confirmed the Dutch discovery of the rich Ertsberg copper and gold deposits, now known as the Grasberg mine, in extremely rugged, remote country in the Jayawijaya Mountains in then-Netherlands New Guinea.[19]
In 1966, Freeport founded Freeport Indonesia, Inc. The subsidiary negotiated a contract with the Indonesian government to develop the Ertsberg deposit. In their feasibility study, Freeport geologists estimated that the orebody totaled 33 million tons averaging 2.5% copper. The Ertsberg was the largest above-ground copper deposit ever discovered.[20] Construction of an open pit mine began in May 1970 and in mid-1973 the mine was declared fully operational. Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg "the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken." The challenges included building a 101-kilometre (63 mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000-foot (610 m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700 m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109-kilometre (68 mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.[20]
1970s[edit]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Freeport Minerals Company to reflect its role as a diversified mineral producer.[19]
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded in 1967 by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. ("Mc"), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett ("Mo"), who were both petroleum geologists, and Byron McLean Rankin, Jr. ("Ran"), "a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations." [19] Kent McWilliams (died 1997) was as knowledgeable of the micro-paleontology of the Louisiana and Texas coasts as any geologist of the twentieth century. McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s.
In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada.[21]
In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100 kg) of gold in its first full year of operation.[17]
In 1985, the company headquarters were moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[14]
In 1985, the company sold a 25% interest in some oil and gas reserves to Britoil for $73.5 million.[22]
In 1989, Freeport sold about $1.5 billion in assets to finance the development of the Grasberg mine and the Main Pass sulfur-oil-gas deposit offshore from Louisiana.[23]
1990s[edit]
In 1994, Freeport-McMoRan spun off its entire interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, which became an independent company, fully focused on the Indonesian operation.
In 1995, RTZ, a predecessor of Rio Tinto made a $450 million investment in the company.[24]
In 1997, IMC Global, a large fertilizer producer, acquired Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the former parent company that now owned the sulfur and fertilizer businesses, in a $750 million transaction. Shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan received shares of IMC Global.[25]
The Indonesian government asked Freeport to substantiate Bre-X's claims of having found the largest gold mine ever discovered. In 1997, the company announced that its prospective partner Bre-X did not have gold reserves at its Indonesian mine, as it had reported. Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.[26]
In 1998, low commodity prices forced the company to suspend its dividend.[27]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the company was subpoenas as a result of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe regarding price fixing in the copper industry.[28]
In 2006, the company acquired Phelps Dodge to become the world's largest public copper company with an enterprise value of $37.5 billion. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.[29]
In 2012, the company announced agreements to acquire affiliated companies McMoRan Exploration Company and Plains Exploration & Production Company for a total enterprise value of over $20 billion. The transaction added significantly to the company's petroleum assets.[30] The transactions were criticized as being a conflict of interest due to the common ownership of the companies.[31]
In 2014, the company sold assets in the Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1 billion.[32]
In 2015, the company announced job cuts at its Sierrita Mine in Arizona due to low copper and molybdenum prices.[33]
In 2016, the company announced the sale of a 13% interest in its Morenci Mine to Sumitomo Group for $1 billion in cash.[34]
Management history[edit]
Notable historical members of the board of directors have included: John Hay Whitney, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Chauncey Stillman, Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller, Augustus Long, Robert A. Lovett, Jean Mauzé, Henry Kissinger 1988-1995, and George Putnam of Putnam Investments.
On December 28, 2015, the company announced that James R. Moffett would step down as chairman of the company and would be replaced as chairman by Gerald J. Ford. Moffett received $16.1 million in severance pay and cash retirement plans totaling more than $63 million. Moffett continued to consult for the company for annual fees of $1.5 million.[35]
The current board members are listed on the company website.[36]
Environmental, human rights, and corruption controversies at the Grasberg Mine[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
Freeport operates the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.
In 2005, The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. Freeport responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and "his cronies", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.[37]
The Grasberg mine's tailings "severely impacted" more than 11 square miles (28 km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.[38] The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.[38]
Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, The Government Pension Fund of Norway has excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund's ethical council.[39]
Strikes[edit]
Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes:
On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places.[40]
In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike.[41]
In 2015, a 5-day strike halted production at the mine as around 100 employees demanded bonuses as an incentive for not participating in a work stoppage during 2014.[42]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Freeport-McMoRan #41 among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities (4.5 million pounds in 2013) and toxicity.[43]
Human rights record[edit]
Freeport-McMoRan is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.[44] However, the company has been accused of funding the Indonesian government to secure its reserve through militaristic oppression of the native West Papuan people. See Papua Conflict

The challenges included building a 101-kilometre (63 mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000-foot (610 m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700 m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109-kilometre (68 mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.[20]
1970s[edit]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Freeport Minerals Company to reflect its role as a diversified mineral producer.[19]
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded in 1967 by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. ("Mc"), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett ("Mo"), who were both petroleum geologists, and Byron McLean Rankin, Jr. ("Ran"), "a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations." [19] Kent McWilliams (died 1997) was as knowledgeable of the micro-paleontology of the Louisiana and Texas coasts as any geologist of the twentieth century. McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s.
In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada.[21]
In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100 kg) of gold in its first full year of operation.[17]
In 1985, the company headquarters were moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[14]
In 1985, the company sold a 25% interest in some oil and gas reserves to Britoil for $73.5 million.[22]
In 1989, Freeport sold about $1.5 billion in assets to finance the development of the Grasberg mine and the Main Pass sulfur-oil-gas deposit offshore from Louisiana.[23]
1990s[edit]
In 1994, Freeport-McMoRan spun off its entire interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, which became an independent company, fully focused on the Indonesian operation.
In 1995, RTZ, a predecessor of Rio Tinto made a $450 million investment in the company.[24]
In 1997, IMC Global, a large fertilizer producer, acquired Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the former parent company that now owned the sulfur and fertilizer businesses, in a $750 million transaction. Shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan received shares of IMC Global.[25]
The Indonesian government asked Freeport to substantiate Bre-X's claims of having found the largest gold mine ever discovered. In 1997, the company announced that its prospective partner Bre-X did not have gold reserves at its Indonesian mine, as it had reported. Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.[26]
In 1998, low commodity prices forced the company to suspend its dividend.[27]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the company was subpoenas as a result of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe regarding price fixing in the copper industry.[28]
In 2006, the company acquired Phelps Dodge to become the world's largest public copper company with an enterprise value of $37.5 billion. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.[29]
In 2012, the company announced agreements to acquire affiliated companies McMoRan Exploration Company and Plains Exploration & Production Company for a total enterprise value of over $20 billion. The transaction added significantly to the company's petroleum assets.[30] The transactions were criticized as being a conflict of interest due to the common ownership of the companies.[31]
In 2014, the company sold assets in the Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1 billion.[32]
In 2015, the company announced job cuts at its Sierrita Mine in Arizona due to low copper and molybdenum prices.[33]
In 2016, the company announced the sale of a 13% interest in its Morenci Mine to Sumitomo Group for $1 billion in cash.[34]
Management history[edit]
Notable historical members of the board of directors have included: John Hay Whitney, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Chauncey Stillman, Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller, Augustus Long, Robert A. Lovett, Jean Mauzé, Henry Kissinger 1988-1995, and George Putnam of Putnam Investments.
On December 28, 2015, the company announced that James R. Moffett would step down as chairman of the company and would be replaced as chairman by Gerald J. Ford. Moffett received $16.1 million in severance pay and cash retirement plans totaling more than $63 million. Moffett continued to consult for the company for annual fees of $1.5 million.[35]
The current board members are listed on the company website.[36]
Environmental, human rights, and corruption controversies at the Grasberg Mine[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
Freeport operates the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.
In 2005, The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. Freeport responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and "his cronies", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.[37]
The Grasberg mine's tailings "severely impacted" more than 11 square miles (28 km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.[38] The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.[38]
Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, The Government Pension Fund of Norway has excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund's ethical council.[39]
Strikes[edit]
Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes:
On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places.[40]
In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike.[41]
In 2015, a 5-day strike halted production at the mine as around 100 employees demanded bonuses as an incentive for not participating in a work stoppage during 2014.[42]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Freeport-McMoRan #41 among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities (4.5 million pounds in 2013) and toxicity.[43]
Human rights record[edit]
Freeport-McMoRan is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.[44] However, the company has been accused of funding the Indonesian government to secure its reserve through militaristic oppression of the native West Papuan people. See Papua Conflict

History[edit]




Freeport Sulphur No.6 entering Freeport, Texas, harbor, 1923


The company was founded as the Texas Freeport Sulphur Company in 1912 as a sulfur mining company in Freeport, Texas.[13]
In 1928, concerned that the management of the company was not moving aggressively to increase reserves, 25-year old investor Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr. collaborated with Payne Whitney to launch a proxy fight and gain control of the company.[14]
Freeport pioneered mining sulphur at mines along the US Gulf Coast using the Frasch Process.[15]
The company began to diversify in 1931, purchasing manganese deposits in Oriente Province, Cuba.[16]
1950s[edit]
The company produced nickel during World War II and potash in the 1950s.[17]
In 1955, Freeport invested $119 million in constructing a nickel-cobalt mine at Moa Bay, Cuba, and a refinery at Port Nickel, Louisiana. On March 11, 1957, the U.S. government announced a contract to buy Freeport nickel and cobalt from Cuba until June 30, 1965, as strategic commodities. Fidel Castro's government nationalized the Cuban facility in 1960.[18]
In 1956, the company formed Freeport Oil Company.[17]
In 1958, the company sold an oil discovery near Lake Washington in Louisiana for approximately $100 million to Magnolia Petroleum Company.[17]
1960s[edit]
In 1961, the company entered the kaolin business after purchasing the assets of Southern Clays Inc.[17]
In 1964, the company formed Freeport of Australia to pursue mining opportunities there and in the surrounding Pacific Ocean region.[17]
Development of the Ertsberg deposit[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
In 1960, Freeport geologists confirmed the Dutch discovery of the rich Ertsberg copper and gold deposits, now known as the Grasberg mine, in extremely rugged, remote country in the Jayawijaya Mountains in then-Netherlands New Guinea.[19]
In 1966, Freeport founded Freeport Indonesia, Inc. The subsidiary negotiated a contract with the Indonesian government to develop the Ertsberg deposit. In their feasibility study, Freeport geologists estimated that the orebody totaled 33 million tons averaging 2.5% copper. The Ertsberg was the largest above-ground copper deposit ever discovered.[20] Construction of an open pit mine began in May 1970 and in mid-1973 the mine was declared fully operational. Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg "the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken." The challenges included building a 101-kilometre (63 mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000-foot (610 m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700 m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109-kilometre (68 mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.[20]

McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s.
In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada.[21]
In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100 kg) of gold in its first full year of operation.[17]
In 1985, the company headquarters were moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[14]

Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.[26]

In 2003, the company was subpoenas as a result of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe regarding price fixing in the copper industry.[28]
In 2006, the company acquired Phelps Dodge to become the world's largest public copper company with an enterprise value of $37.5 billion. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.[29]

In 2005, The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. Freeport responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and "his cronies", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.[37]
The Grasberg mine's tailings "severely impacted" more than 11 square miles (28 km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.[38] The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.[38]
Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, The Government Pension Fund of Norway has excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund's ethical council.[39]

History[edit]




Freeport Sulphur No.6 entering Freeport, Texas, harbor, 1923


The company was founded as the Texas Freeport Sulphur Company in 1912 as a sulfur mining company in Freeport, Texas.[13]
In 1928, concerned that the management of the company was not moving aggressively to increase reserves, 25-year old investor Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr. collaborated with Payne Whitney to launch a proxy fight and gain control of the company.[14]
Freeport pioneered mining sulphur at mines along the US Gulf Coast using the Frasch Process.[15]
The company began to diversify in 1931, purchasing manganese deposits in Oriente Province, Cuba.[16]
1950s[edit]
The company produced nickel during World War II and potash in the 1950s.[17]
In 1955, Freeport invested $119 million in constructing a nickel-cobalt mine at Moa Bay, Cuba, and a refinery at Port Nickel, Louisiana. On March 11, 1957, the U.S. government announced a contract to buy Freeport nickel and cobalt from Cuba until June 30, 1965, as strategic commodities. Fidel Castro's government nationalized the Cuban facility in 1960.[18]
In 1956, the company formed Freeport Oil Company.[17]
In 1958, the company sold an oil discovery near Lake Washington in Louisiana for approximately $100 million to Magnolia Petroleum Company.[17]
1960s[edit]
In 1961, the company entered the kaolin business after purchasing the assets of Southern Clays Inc.[17]
In 1964, the company formed Freeport of Australia to pursue mining opportunities there and in the surrounding Pacific Ocean region.[17]
Development of the Ertsberg deposit[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
In 1960, Freeport geologists confirmed the Dutch discovery of the rich Ertsberg copper and gold deposits, now known as the Grasberg mine, in extremely rugged, remote country in the Jayawijaya Mountains in then-Netherlands New Guinea.[19]
In 1966, Freeport founded Freeport Indonesia, Inc. The subsidiary negotiated a contract with the Indonesian government to develop the Ertsberg deposit. In their feasibility study, Freeport geologists estimated that the orebody totaled 33 million tons averaging 2.5% copper. The Ertsberg was the largest above-ground copper deposit ever discovered.[20] Construction of an open pit mine began in May 1970 and in mid-1973 the mine was declared fully operational. Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg "the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken." The challenges included building a 101-kilometre (63 mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000-foot (610 m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700 m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109-kilometre (68 mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.[20]
1970s[edit]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Freeport Minerals Company to reflect its role as a diversified mineral producer.[19]
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded in 1967 by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. ("Mc"), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett ("Mo"), who were both petroleum geologists, and Byron McLean Rankin, Jr. ("Ran"), "a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations." [19] Kent McWilliams (died 1997) was as knowledgeable of the micro-paleontology of the Louisiana and Texas coasts as any geologist of the twentieth century. McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s.
In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada.[21]
In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100 kg) of gold in its first full year of operation.[17]
In 1985, the company headquarters were moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[14]
In 1985, the company sold a 25% interest in some oil and gas reserves to Britoil for $73.5 million.[22]
In 1989, Freeport sold about $1.5 billion in assets to finance the development of the Grasberg mine and the Main Pass sulfur-oil-gas deposit offshore from Louisiana.[23]
1990s[edit]
In 1994, Freeport-McMoRan spun off its entire interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, which became an independent company, fully focused on the Indonesian operation.
In 1995, RTZ, a predecessor of Rio Tinto made a $450 million investment in the company.[24]
In 1997, IMC Global, a large fertilizer producer, acquired Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the former parent company that now owned the sulfur and fertilizer businesses, in a $750 million transaction. Shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan received shares of IMC Global.[25]
The Indonesian government asked Freeport to substantiate Bre-X's claims of having found the largest gold mine ever discovered. In 1997, the company announced that its prospective partner Bre-X did not have gold reserves at its Indonesian mine, as it had reported. Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.[26]
In 1998, low commodity prices forced the company to suspend its dividend.[27]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the company was subpoenas as a result of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe regarding price fixing in the copper industry.[28]
In 2006, the company acquired Phelps Dodge to become the world's largest public copper company with an enterprise value of $37.5 billion. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.[29]
In 2012, the company announced agreements to acquire affiliated companies McMoRan Exploration Company and Plains Exploration & Production Company for a total enterprise value of over $20 billion. The transaction added significantly to the company's petroleum assets.[30] The transactions were criticized as being a conflict of interest due to the common ownership of the companies.[31]
In 2014, the company sold assets in the Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1 billion.[32]
In 2015, the company announced job cuts at its Sierrita Mine in Arizona due to low copper and molybdenum prices.[33]
In 2016, the company announced the sale of a 13% interest in its Morenci Mine to Sumitomo Group for $1 billion in cash.[34]
Management history[edit]
Notable historical members of the board of directors have included: John Hay Whitney, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Chauncey Stillman, Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller, Augustus Long, Robert A. Lovett, Jean Mauzé, Henry Kissinger 1988-1995, and George Putnam of Putnam Investments.
On December 28, 2015, the company announced that James R. Moffett would step down as chairman of the company and would be replaced as chairman by Gerald J. Ford. Moffett received $16.1 million in severance pay and cash retirement plans totaling more than $63 million. Moffett continued to consult for the company for annual fees of $1.5 million.[35]
The current board members are listed on the company website.[36]
Environmental, human rights, and corruption controversies at the Grasberg Mine[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
Freeport operates the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.
In 2005, The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. Freeport responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and "his cronies", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.[37]
The Grasberg mine's tailings "severely impacted" more than 11 square miles (28 km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.[38] The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.[38]
Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, The Government Pension Fund of Norway has excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund's ethical council.[39]
Strikes[edit]
Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes:
On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places.[40]
In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike.[41]
In 2015, a 5-day strike halted production at the mine as around 100 employees demanded bonuses as an incentive for not participating in a work stoppage during 2014.[42]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Freeport-McMoRan #41 among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities (4.5 million pounds in 2013) and toxicity.[43]
Human rights record[edit]
Freeport-McMoRan is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.[44] However, the company has been accused of funding the Indonesian government to secure its reserve through militaristic oppression of the native West Papuan people. See Papua Conflict

History[edit]




Freeport Sulphur No.6 entering Freeport, Texas, harbor, 1923


The company was founded as the Texas Freeport Sulphur Company in 1912 as a sulfur mining company in Freeport, Texas.[13]
In 1928, concerned that the management of the company was not moving aggressively to increase reserves, 25-year old investor Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr. collaborated with Payne Whitney to launch a proxy fight and gain control of the company.[14]
Freeport pioneered mining sulphur at mines along the US Gulf Coast using the Frasch Process.[15]
The company began to diversify in 1931, purchasing manganese deposits in Oriente Province, Cuba.[16]
1950s[edit]
The company produced nickel during World War II and potash in the 1950s.[17]
In 1955, Freeport invested $119 million in constructing a nickel-cobalt mine at Moa Bay, Cuba, and a refinery at Port Nickel, Louisiana. On March 11, 1957, the U.S. government announced a contract to buy Freeport nickel and cobalt from Cuba until June 30, 1965, as strategic commodities. Fidel Castro's government nationalized the Cuban facility in 1960.[18]
In 1956, the company formed Freeport Oil Company.[17]
In 1958, the company sold an oil discovery near Lake Washington in Louisiana for approximately $100 million to Magnolia Petroleum Company.[17]
1960s[edit]
In 1961, the company entered the kaolin business after purchasing the assets of Southern Clays Inc.[17]
In 1964, the company formed Freeport of Australia to pursue mining opportunities there and in the surrounding Pacific Ocean region.[17]
Development of the Ertsberg deposit[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
In 1960, Freeport geologists confirmed the Dutch discovery of the rich Ertsberg copper and gold deposits, now known as the Grasberg mine, in extremely rugged, remote country in the Jayawijaya Mountains in then-Netherlands New Guinea.[19]
In 1966, Freeport founded Freeport Indonesia, Inc. The subsidiary negotiated a contract with the Indonesian government to develop the Ertsberg deposit. In their feasibility study, Freeport geologists estimated that the orebody totaled 33 million tons averaging 2.5% copper. The Ertsberg was the largest above-ground copper deposit ever discovered.[20] Construction of an open pit mine began in May 1970 and in mid-1973 the mine was declared fully operational. Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg "the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken." The challenges included building a 101-kilometre (63 mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000-foot (610 m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700 m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109-kilometre (68 mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.[20]
1970s[edit]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Freeport Minerals Company to reflect its role as a diversified mineral producer.[19]
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded in 1967 by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. ("Mc"), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett ("Mo"), who were both petroleum geologists, and Byron McLean Rankin, Jr. ("Ran"), "a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations." [19] Kent McWilliams (died 1997) was as knowledgeable of the micro-paleontology of the Louisiana and Texas coasts as any geologist of the twentieth century. McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s.
In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada.[21]
In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100 kg) of gold in its first full year of operation.[17]
In 1985, the company headquarters were moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[14]
In 1985, the company sold a 25% interest in some oil and gas reserves to Britoil for $73.5 million.[22]
In 1989, Freeport sold about $1.5 billion in assets to finance the development of the Grasberg mine and the Main Pass sulfur-oil-gas deposit offshore from Louisiana.[23]
1990s[edit]
In 1994, Freeport-McMoRan spun off its entire interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, which became an independent company, fully focused on the Indonesian operation.
In 1995, RTZ, a predecessor of Rio Tinto made a $450 million investment in the company.[24]
In 1997, IMC Global, a large fertilizer producer, acquired Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the former parent company that now owned the sulfur and fertilizer businesses, in a $750 million transaction. Shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan received shares of IMC Global.[25]
The Indonesian government asked Freeport to substantiate Bre-X's claims of having found the largest gold mine ever discovered. In 1997, the company announced that its prospective partner Bre-X did not have gold reserves at its Indonesian mine, as it had reported. Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.[26]
In 1998, low commodity prices forced the company to suspend its dividend.[27]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the company was subpoenas as a result of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe regarding price fixing in the copper industry.[28]
In 2006, the company acquired Phelps Dodge to become the world's largest public copper company with an enterprise value of $37.5 billion. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.[29]
In 2012, the company announced agreements to acquire affiliated companies McMoRan Exploration Company and Plains Exploration & Production Company for a total enterprise value of over $20 billion. The transaction added significantly to the company's petroleum assets.[30] The transactions were criticized as being a conflict of interest due to the common ownership of the companies.[31]
In 2014, the company sold assets in the Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1 billion.[32]
In 2015, the company announced job cuts at its Sierrita Mine in Arizona due to low copper and molybdenum prices.[33]
In 2016, the company announced the sale of a 13% interest in its Morenci Mine to Sumitomo Group for $1 billion in cash.[34]
Management history[edit]
Notable historical members of the board of directors have included: John Hay Whitney, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Chauncey Stillman, Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller, Augustus Long, Robert A. Lovett, Jean Mauzé, Henry Kissinger 1988-1995, and George Putnam of Putnam Investments.
On December 28, 2015, the company announced that James R. Moffett would step down as chairman of the company and would be replaced as chairman by Gerald J. Ford. Moffett received $16.1 million in severance pay and cash retirement plans totaling more than $63 million. Moffett continued to consult for the company for annual fees of $1.5 million.[35]
The current board members are listed on the company website.[36]
Environmental, human rights, and corruption controversies at the Grasberg Mine[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
Freeport operates the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.
In 2005, The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. Freeport responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and "his cronies", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.[37]
The Grasberg mine's tailings "severely impacted" more than 11 square miles (28 km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.[38] The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.[38]
Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, The Government Pension Fund of Norway has excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund's ethical council.[39]
Strikes[edit]
Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes:
On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places.[40]
In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike.[41]
In 2015, a 5-day strike halted production at the mine as around 100 employees demanded bonuses as an incentive for not participating in a work stoppage during 2014.[42]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Freeport-McMoRan #41 among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities (4.5 million pounds in 2013) and toxicity.[43]
Human rights record[edit]
Freeport-McMoRan is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.[44] However, the company has been accused of funding the Indonesian government to secure its reserve through militaristic oppression of the native West Papuan people. See Papua Conflict

History[edit]




Freeport Sulphur No.6 entering Freeport, Texas, harbor, 1923


The company was founded as the Texas Freeport Sulphur Company in 1912 as a sulfur mining company in Freeport, Texas.[13]
In 1928, concerned that the management of the company was not moving aggressively to increase reserves, 25-year old investor Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr. collaborated with Payne Whitney to launch a proxy fight and gain control of the company.[14]
Freeport pioneered mining sulphur at mines along the US Gulf Coast using the Frasch Process.[15]
The company began to diversify in 1931, purchasing manganese deposits in Oriente Province, Cuba.[16]
1950s[edit]
The company produced nickel during World War II and potash in the 1950s.[17]
In 1955, Freeport invested $119 million in constructing a nickel-cobalt mine at Moa Bay, Cuba, and a refinery at Port Nickel, Louisiana. On March 11, 1957, the U.S. government announced a contract to buy Freeport nickel and cobalt from Cuba until June 30, 1965, as strategic commodities. Fidel Castro's government nationalized the Cuban facility in 1960.[18]
In 1956, the company formed Freeport Oil Company.[17]
In 1958, the company sold an oil discovery near Lake Washington in Louisiana for approximately $100 million to Magnolia Petroleum Company.[17]
1960s[edit]
In 1961, the company entered the kaolin business after purchasing the assets of Southern Clays Inc.[17]
In 1964, the company formed Freeport of Australia to pursue mining opportunities there and in the surrounding Pacific Ocean region.[17]
Development of the Ertsberg deposit[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
In 1960, Freeport geologists confirmed the Dutch discovery of the rich Ertsberg copper and gold deposits, now known as the Grasberg mine, in extremely rugged, remote country in the Jayawijaya Mountains in then-Netherlands New Guinea.[19]
In 1966, Freeport founded Freeport Indonesia, Inc. The subsidiary negotiated a contract with the Indonesian government to develop the Ertsberg deposit. In their feasibility study, Freeport geologists estimated that the orebody totaled 33 million tons averaging 2.5% copper. The Ertsberg was the largest above-ground copper deposit ever discovered.[20] Construction of an open pit mine began in May 1970 and in mid-1973 the mine was declared fully operational. Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg "the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken." The challenges included building a 101-kilometre (63 mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000-foot (610 m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700 m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109-kilometre (68 mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.[20]
1970s[edit]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Freeport Minerals Company to reflect its role as a diversified mineral producer.[19]
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded in 1967 by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. ("Mc"), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett ("Mo"), who were both petroleum geologists, and Byron McLean Rankin, Jr. ("Ran"), "a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations." [19] Kent McWilliams (died 1997) was as knowledgeable of the micro-paleontology of the Louisiana and Texas coasts as any geologist of the twentieth century. McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s.
In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada.[21]
In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100 kg) of gold in its first full year of operation.[17]
In 1985, the company headquarters were moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[14]
In 1985, the company sold a 25% interest in some oil and gas reserves to Britoil for $73.5 million.[22]
In 1989, Freeport sold about $1.5 billion in assets to finance the development of the Grasberg mine and the Main Pass sulfur-oil-gas deposit offshore from Louisiana.[23]
1990s[edit]
In 1994, Freeport-McMoRan spun off its entire interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, which became an independent company, fully focused on the Indonesian operation.
In 1995, RTZ, a predecessor of Rio Tinto made a $450 million investment in the company.[24]
In 1997, IMC Global, a large fertilizer producer, acquired Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the former parent company that now owned the sulfur and fertilizer businesses, in a $750 million transaction. Shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan received shares of IMC Global.[25]
The Indonesian government asked Freeport to substantiate Bre-X's claims of having found the largest gold mine ever discovered. In 1997, the company announced that its prospective partner Bre-X did not have gold reserves at its Indonesian mine, as it had reported. Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.[26]
In 1998, low commodity prices forced the company to suspend its dividend.[27]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the company was subpoenas as a result of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe regarding price fixing in the copper industry.[28]
In 2006, the company acquired Phelps Dodge to become the world's largest public copper company with an enterprise value of $37.5 billion. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.[29]
In 2012, the company announced agreements to acquire affiliated companies McMoRan Exploration Company and Plains Exploration & Production Company for a total enterprise value of over $20 billion. The transaction added significantly to the company's petroleum assets.[30] The transactions were criticized as being a conflict of interest due to the common ownership of the companies.[31]
In 2014, the company sold assets in the Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1 billion.[32]
In 2015, the company announced job cuts at its Sierrita Mine in Arizona due to low copper and molybdenum prices.[33]
In 2016, the company announced the sale of a 13% interest in its Morenci Mine to Sumitomo Group for $1 billion in cash.[34]
Management history[edit]
Notable historical members of the board of directors have included: John Hay Whitney, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Chauncey Stillman, Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller, Augustus Long, Robert A. Lovett, Jean Mauzé, Henry Kissinger 1988-1995, and George Putnam of Putnam Investments.
On December 28, 2015, the company announced that James R. Moffett would step down as chairman of the company and would be replaced as chairman by Gerald J. Ford. Moffett received $16.1 million in severance pay and cash retirement plans totaling more than $63 million. Moffett continued to consult for the company for annual fees of $1.5 million.[35]
The current board members are listed on the company website.[36]
Environmental, human rights, and corruption controversies at the Grasberg Mine[edit]
Main article: Grasberg mine
Freeport operates the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.
In 2005, The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. Freeport responded that the payments were not for individuals, but rather for infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company also claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia's dictator and "his cronies", cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists' e-mails and telephone conversations, in cooperation with Indonesian military intelligence officers.[37]
The Grasberg mine's tailings "severely impacted" more than 11 square miles (28 km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames & Moore environmental audit.[38] The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.[38]
Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, The Government Pension Fund of Norway has excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund's ethical council.[39]
Strikes[edit]
Production at the mine has been affected by several strikes:
On October 17, 2011, the company halted operations in Papua amid a strike that led to a deteriorating security situation and intensified calls for Papuan independence. Seventy percent of Grasberg workers joined the strike, appealing for higher pay September 15, 2011, blocking roads, clashing with police and cutting the pipeline in several places.[40]
In October 2014, around 1,000 workers stayed home and demanded the firing of 50 managers as a result of a fatal accident at the Grasberg mine. Production declined to 60-70% of normal levels as a result of the strike.[41]
In 2015, a 5-day strike halted production at the mine as around 100 employees demanded bonuses as an incentive for not participating in a work stoppage during 2014.[42]
Environmental record[edit]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Freeport-McMoRan #41 among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities (4.5 million pounds in 2013) and toxicity.[43]
Human rights record[edit]
Freeport-McMoRan is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.[44] However, the company has been accused of funding the Indonesian government to secure its reserve through militaristic oppression of the native West Papuan people. See Papua Conflict
