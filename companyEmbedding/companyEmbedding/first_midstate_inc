OUR SERVICES

Full Spectrum of Services
First Midstate Incorporated offers its clients a full spectrum of public finance services. We recognize that the staff at most units of local government are stretched to the limits already and have a limited amount of time to devote to financing projects. Some of our services include:


	Complete a debt analysis of all municipal general obligation debt presently outstanding for the issuer and a comprehensive analysis of various potential maturity schedules and rates required to service both principal and interest payments of any potential Bond Issue. Recommend maturity schedule and other indenture requirements. Review potential legally available alternative financing methods.
	When a referendum is needed we assist the Issuer and its steering committee in developing a campaign to inform the voters as to the need for and advantages of the proposed project.
	Assist disclosure counsel with preparation of the Official Statement (including summary of financial, industrial, and demographic information as well a profile of the Community).
	Recommend possible dates of sale in line with market conditions, legal necessities, and project requirements.
	Cooperate and coordinate the project with the architects, engineers, attorneys, staff and recognized Bond Counsel. Prepare necessary showings to obtain Moody's and/or Standard & Poor's rating or Municipal Bond Insurance.
	Recommend an investment schedule for bond money after consulting with appropriate parties or consultants after delivery of the bonds, if appropriate.
	Act as Underwriters in the marketing of the Bonds.
	Coordinate Bond printing, document distribution, establishment of necessary accounts and bond closing.
	Provide overlapping debt information, as needed to the issuer's staff members for use in annual reports and budgeting.
	Prepare annual review items for rating services and/or continuing disclosure on an as needed basis upon the direction of the issuer.


The scope of our service extends well beyond any single project. We regularly communicate with our clients on current issues in public finance including potential legal, legislative and tax law changes that may impact a particular unit of local government.

If you have more questions or need more information, please contact us.

ABOUT FIRST MIDSTATE

First Midstate Incorporated
First Midstate Incorporated is an investment banking firm in Bloomington, Illinois. We have over 50 years of experience in the formulation, voting and marketing of Illinois municipal bonds. We decided long ago that rather than trying to be all things to all people, First Midstate would specialize in public finance. Our location in Bloomington makes us easily accessible to all Illinois locations and allows us to provide the full spectrum of personal service that our clients enjoy. Likewise, by being in regular contact with Illinois issuers, we are able to keep attuned to specific Illinois financing trends and needs.



Some of the areas of service which our clients have found helpful include:

	Exploration of various financing methods and vehicles to best solve their needs.

	Preliminary planning and structuring of debt and amortization schedules.

	Preparation of factual information to the public.

	Assist Bond Attorneys and the Issuer's representatives in formulating the project.

	Attend meetings as needed to properly formulate the project.

	Reinvestment schedules for Bond proceeds to concur with the schedule of payments as estimated by the project budget.


Throughout our 50+ years of experience we have assisted a variety of municipalities including School Districts, Cities and Villages, Community Colleges, Colleges, Hospitals, Airport Authorities, Park Districts, Road Districts, Counties, Public Building Commissions and 501(c)(3) entities with their financing needs. Over 500 municipalities throughout Illinois have used our services, most of which have their own unique circumstances.

	We have had extensive experience with many different types of municipal bond issues and financing vehicles including:  Refunding Bonds, Funding Bonds, Alternate Revenue Bonds, Road and Street Bonds, Working Cash Fund Bonds, School Building Bonds, Life/Safety Bonds, Teachers Orders, Lease/Debt Certificates, Insurance Reserve Bonds,
Capital Appreciation Bonds, Certificates of Participation (Lease Financing), Special Service Area Bonds, Tax Increment Financing Bonds, Sales Tax Bonds, Water and Sewer Bonds, Airport Authority Bonds and Park Bonds. We have worked with both taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds.




Marketing Experience and Expertise:
	First Midstate Incorporated has developed an extensive list of municipal bond purchasers. This broad base affords us the ability to place each issue with the investors most suitable for that particular project or maturity at competitive interest rates. In addition, we strive to be sensitive to local marketing concerns. We have handled issues of varying size and complexity in our over 50 years of experience. We recognize that each issue is extremely important to the issues regardless of the size of the project.

	
Qualified and Experienced Personnel
A total of ten full-time persons specializing in Illinois public finance comprise our office and represent over 100 years of combined experience. First Midstate Incorporated is registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the State of Illinois Securities Department. The firm is regulated by the State of Illinois, FINRA, Securities Exchange Commission and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.


	The firm is supervised by financial principal Paul D. Brown and has an excellent working relationship with various nationally recognized Bond Counsel, certified public accountants, architects, engineers and insurance analysts. We have the availability of each of these firms' expertise in their respective fields. It is our philosophy to consult with highly professional, nationally recognized persons and firms in all areas of finance and to utilize their expertise in conjunction with the knowledge of our staff to develop and implement the appropriate financing plan for a specific project.
