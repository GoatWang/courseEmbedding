Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 1 Hold RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 1.50)Consensus Price Target: $28.00 (11.87% upside)

Urban Edge Properties LP ("UELP" or the "Operating Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed to serve as the Company's majority-owned partnership subsidiary and to own, through affiliates, all of the Company's real estate properties and other assets. UE and UELP were created to own the majority of Vornado Realty Trust's ("Vornado")

As a result, VRLP common limited partners and Vornado common shareholders all received common shares of UE in the spin-off at a ratio of one common share of UE to every two VRLP common units and every two common shares of Vornado.   increased consolidated retail portfolio occupancy(2) to 97.2% as of December 31, 2016 from 96.2% as of December 31, 2015;   signed 54 new leases totaling 354,911 square feet, including 26 new leases on a same-space(3) basis totaling 132,315 square feet at an average rental rate of $32.00 per square foot on a GAAP basis and $29.47 per square foot on a cash basis, generating average rent spreads of 41.7% on a GAAP basis and 25.8% on a cash basis; and   renewed or extended 52 leases totaling 554,259 square feet, including 52 leases on a same-space basis totaling 554,259 square feet at an average rental rate of $16.87 per square foot on a GAAP basis and $16.53 per square foot on a cash basis, generating average rent spreads of 13.1% on a GAAP basis and 7.1% on a cash basis.  Investment Strategies. Our investment strategy is to selectively deploy capital through a combination of acquisitions, redevelopment and development in our target markets that is expected to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and, at the same time, to sell assets that no longer meet our investment criteria. In addition to creating value from our existing assets through proactive management, when appropriate, we will redevelop certain assets, will pursue new developments and will acquire properties adjacent to them. During 2016, we:   completed projects at Walnut Creek and East Hanover REI;   identified approximately $73.0 million of development and redevelopment pipeline projects expected to be completed over the next several years;   completed the sale of a shopping center located in Waterbury, CT for $21.6 million resulting in a gain of $15.6 million; The sale completed the reverse Section 1031 tax deferred exchange transaction with the acquisition of Cross Bay Commons;  (1)Information provided on a same-property basis includes the results of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and excludes properties that were under development, redevelopment or that involve anchor repositioning where a substantial portion of the gross leasable area is taken out of service and properties acquired, sold, or in the foreclosure process during the periods being compared and totals 77 properties as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   acquired a 0.3 acre outparcel adjacent to Tonnelle Commons in North Bergen, NJ for $2.7 million on December 22, 2016, which will be the future site of a 2,000 sf Popeye's and;   executed contracts to acquire Hudson Mall in Jersey City, NJ for an aggregate purchase price of $43.7 million, the Shops at Bruckner in the Bronx, NY for an aggregate purchase price of $32.0 million, and Yonkers Gateway Center in Yonkers, NY for an aggregate purchase price of $51.7 million. These acquisitions closed subsequent to December 31, 2016.  Capital Strategies. Our capital strategy is to keep our balance sheet flexible and capable of supporting growth by using cash flow from operations, borrowing under our existing line of credit and reinvesting funds from selective asset sales. During 2016, we:   transferred our property in Englewood, NJ to receivership; the receiver manages the property while the Company remains the title owner until the receiver disposes of the property; and   ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $131.7 million and net debt (net of cash) to total market capitalization of 26.0% as of December 31, 2016.  2017 Outlook. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following:   expediting the delivery of space to and the collection of rent from tenants with executed leases that have not yet commenced;   creating additional value from our existing assets by redevelopment of existing space, development of new space such as expansion and pad sites and by anchor repositioning; and   disposing of non-core assets and, when possible, reinvesting the proceeds in the redevelopment of and/or new development on existing properties and in acquiring additional properties meeting our investment criteria.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as "GAAP", requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition, certain information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined results of operations or financial condition.  Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:  Real Estate - The nature of our business as an owner, redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers means that we invest significant amounts of capital into our properties. Depreciation, amortization and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole. Real estate is capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets' physical and economic useful lives which range from 3 to 40 years. We periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income. Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.  Real estate undergoing redevelopment activities is also carried at cost but no depreciation is recognized. All property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to, the redevelopment, including interest, are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when completed. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property, the excess is charged to impairment expense. The capitalization period begins when redevelopment activities are underway and ends when the project is substantially complete. Generally, a redevelopment is considered substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from completion of major construction  activity. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income.  Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. Based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities.  In allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts, including fixed rate below-market renewal options, to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and our estimate of the market lease rates and other lease provisions for comparable leases measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease. Tenant related intangibles and improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term, including any bargain renewal options. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. We consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place leases. If the value of below-market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. If a lease terminates prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off.  Our properties are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property's carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - We make estimates of the collectibility of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which require significant judgment by management. The collectibility of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions, bankruptcies, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement. While we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense, actual collectibility could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income.  With respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables, we assess the collectibility of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable, credit history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant's ability to meet its contractual lease obligations, and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant.  The straight-line receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Due to the nature of the straight-line receivable, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. The extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the deferral of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. These estimates have a direct impact on our earnings.  Revenue Recognition - We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:   Base Rent - income arising from minimum lease payments from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a lease incentive to tenants, we recognize the incentive as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.   Percentage Rent - income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved).   Expense Reimbursements - revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses, real estate taxes and capital improvements of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred.   Management, Leasing and Other Fees - income arising from contractual agreements with third parties. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 3 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that may affect us.  Results of Operations   Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2016 2015 Net income $ 96,630 $ 41,348 FFO applicable to diluted common shareholders(1) 136,493 97,951 Cash NOI(2) 211,541 205,262 Same-property cash NOI(2) 187,999 180,591  (1) FFO applicable to diluted common shareholders is utilized as a performance measure for Urban Edge, refer to page 34 for a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.  Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to 2015 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $96.6 million, compared to net income of $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table summarizes certain line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income that we believe are important in understanding our operations and/or those items which significantly changed in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015: For the year ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2016 2015 $ Change Total revenue $ 325,976 $ 322,945 $ 3,031 Real estate tax expenses 51,429 49,311 2,118 Property operating expenses 45,280 50,595 (5,315 ) General and administrative expenses 27,438 32,044 (4,606 ) Transaction costs 1,405 24,011 (22,606 ) Gain on sale of real estate 15,618 - 15,618 Interest and debt expense 51,881 55,584 (3,703 ) Income tax expense 804 1,294 (490 )  Total revenue of $326.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $3.0 million from $322.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to:   $0.5 million net increase associated with properties acquired and sold in 2016 and 2015;   $0.3 million increase in tenant expense reimbursements due to recoveries derived from the growth in capital improvements partially offset by a decrease in recoverable expenses;   partially offset by $1.7 million lower tenant bankruptcy settlement income; and   $0.5 million decrease in management and development fee income due to properties under management sold during 2015.  Real estate tax expenses increased by $2.1 million to $51.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $49.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to:   $0.5 million increase due to the acquisition of Cross Bay Commons in December 2015; and   partially offset by $0.7 million of additional real estate taxes capitalized related to space taken out of service for development and redevelopment projects.  Property operating expenses decreased by $5.3 million to $45.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $50.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to:   $1.4 million of environmental remediation costs accrued in 2015; and   $0.7 million decrease in non-recoverable operating expenses including property level litigation costs.  General and administrative expenses decreased by $4.6 million to $27.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $32.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to: . . .  Feb 16, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

On January 4, 2017, we acquired fee and leasehold interests in Yonkers Gateway Center. Consideration for this purchase consisted of the issuance of $48.8 million in OP units and $2.9 million of cash. The total number of OP units issued was 1.8 million at a value of $27.09 per unit. Transaction costs associated with this acquisition were $0.2 million.


                                        








On January 17, 2017, we acquired the leasehold interest in the Shops at Bruckner for $32.3 million, consisting of the assumption of the existing debt of $12.6 million and $19.4 million of cash. The property is a 114,000 sf retail center in the Bronx, NY directly across from our 376,000 sf Bruckner Commons Shopping Center. We own the land under the Shops at Bruckner and had been leasing it to the seller under a ground lease that ran through September 2044. Concurrent with the acquisition, we wrote-off the unamortized intangible liability balance related to the below-market ground lease as well as the existing straight-line receivable


                                        








balance. As a result, we recognized $39.2 million of income from acquired leasehold interest in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Transaction costs associated with this acquisition were $0.3 million.


                                        








On February 2, 2017, we acquired Hudson Mall, a 383,000 sf retail center in Jersey City, NJ adjacent to our existing Hudson Commons shopping center. Consideration for this purchase consisted of the assumption of the existing debt of $23.8 million and $19.9 million of cash. Transaction costs associated with this acquisition were $0.6 million.


                                        








At March 31, 2017, we had one property classified as held for sale in Eatontown, NJ based on the executed contract of sale with a third-party buyer and our intent to dispose of the property. The carrying amount of our property in Eatontown, NJ is $5.1 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $0.3 million, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The book value of this property exceeded its estimated fair value less costs to sell, and as such, an impairment charge of $3.2 million was recognized at March 31, 2017. Our determination of fair value was based on the executed contract of sale with a third-party buyer.


                                        








There was no acquisition or disposition activity in the quarter ended March 31, 2016.

On March 29, 2017, we refinanced the $74 million, 4.59% mortgage loan secured by our Tonnelle Commons property in North Bergen, NJ, increasing the principal balance to $100 million at 4.18% with a 10-year fixed rate mortgage. As a result, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 comprised of a $1.2 million prepayment penalty and write-off of $0.1 million of unamortized deferred financing fees on the original loan.


                                        








On January 15, 2015, we entered into a $500 million Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with certain financial institutions. On March 7, 2017, we amended and extended the Agreement. The amendment increased the credit facility size by $100 million to $600 million and extended the maturity date to March 7, 2021 with two six-month extension options. Borrowings under the Agreement are subject to interest at LIBOR plus 1.15% and we are required to pay an annual facility fee of 20 basis points which is expensed within interest and debt expense as incurred. Both the spread over LIBOR and the facility fee are based on our current leverage ratio and are subject to increase if our leverage ratio increases above predefined thresholds. The Agreement contains customary financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio of 60% and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5x. No amounts have been drawn to date under the Agreement.


                                        








On March 30, 2015, we notified the lender that due to tenants vacating the Englewood shopping center, the property's operating cash flow would be insufficient to pay its debt service. As of March 31, 2017, we were in default and the property was transferred to receivership. Urban Edge no longer manages the property but will remain its title owner until the receiver disposes of the property.

On February 24, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees of the Company approved the Company's 2017 Outperformance Plan ("2017 OPP"), a multi-year performance-based equity compensation program. The purpose of the 2017 Outperformance Plan is to further align the interests of the Company's shareholders with that of management by encouraging the Company's senior officers to create shareholder value in a "pay for performance" structure. The aggregate notional amount of the 2017 OPP grant is $12.0 million. 302,000 LTIP units were granted in connection with the 2017 OPP. LTIP units will be awarded if the performance criteria are met in accordance with the OPPs.

Total revenue increased by $43.0 million to $126.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $83.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to:


                                        








       $2.2 million net increase associated with revenue from properties acquired in the first quarter of 2017;


                                        








       $1.4 million net increase in property rentals due to rent commencements, contractual rent increases and increase in percentage rental income, partially offset by tenant vacancies primarily at development projects;


                                        








       $1.2 million increase in tenant expense reimbursements due to an increase in recoverable expenses and revenue from recoverable capital projects;


                                        








       partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in other income due to a decrease in tenant bankruptcy settlement income received during the first quarter of 2017.


                                        








Property operating expenses increased by $0.5 million to $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $12.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in common area maintenance expenses.


                                        








       $0.5 million increase in legal, other professional fees and costs related to information technology.


                                        








Real estate impairment loss of $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 was recognized on our held for sale property in Eatontown, NJ. The book value of this property exceeded its estimated fair value less costs to sell, and as such, an impairment charge of $3.2 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company's determination of fair value was based on the executed contract of sale with a third-party buyer.

       partially offset by $0.3 million increase of interest from loans assumed on acquisitions closed during the first quarter of 2017.


                                        








Loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 was recognized as a result of the refinancing of our mortgage loan secured by our Tonnelle Commons property in North Bergen, NJ. The loss on extinguishment of debt is comprised of a $1.2 million prepayment penalty and $0.1 million of unamortized deferred financing fees on the original loan.


                                        








Non-GAAP Financial Measures


                                        








Throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a "same-property" cash basis which includes the results of operations that we consolidated, owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, totaling 76 properties for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Information provided on a same-property basis excludes properties that were under development, redevelopment or that involve anchor repositioning where a substantial portion of the gross leasable area is taken out of service and also excludes properties acquired, sold, under contract to be sold, or that are in the foreclosure process during the periods being compared. While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, a property is removed from the same-property pool when a property is considered to be a redevelopment property because it is undergoing significant renovation or retenanting pursuant to a formal plan and is expected to have a significant impact on property operating income based on the retenanting that is occurring. A development or redevelopment property is moved back to the same-property pool once a substantial portion of the NOI growth expected from the development or redevelopment is reflected in both the current and comparable prior year period, generally one year after at least 80% of the expected NOI from the project is realized on a cash basis for a full quarter. Acquisitions are moved into the same-property pool once we have owned the property for the entirety of the comparable periods and the property is not under significant development or redevelopment.


                                        








We calculate same-property cash NOI using net income as defined by GAAP reflecting only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, adjusted for the following items: lease termination fees, bankruptcy settlement income, non-cash rental income and ground rent expense and income or expenses that we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, if any.


                                        








The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to cash NOI is net income. Cash NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. We calculate cash NOI by adjusting GAAP operating income to add back depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, real estate impairment losses and non-cash ground rent expense, and deduct non-cash rental income resulting from the straight-lining of rents and amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases.


                                        








We use cash NOI internally to make investment and capital allocation decisions and to compare the unlevered performance of our properties to our peers. Further, we believe cash NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, cash NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and disposition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from operating income or net income. As such, cash NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of properties during the periods presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the operating performance of the Company's properties. Cash NOI and same-property cash NOI should not be considered substitutes for operating income or net income and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by others.
