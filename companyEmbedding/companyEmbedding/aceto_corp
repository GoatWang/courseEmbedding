PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACETO Corporation (NASDAQ:ACET), an international company engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals, today announced that Rising Pharmaceuticals, its finished dosage form generics subsidiary, recently launched:

Ramipril Capsules, 1.25mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, and 10mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Altace® from Pfizer, which is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Losartan Potassium Tablets, 25mg and 50mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Cozaar® from Merck, which is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Losartan Potassium and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, 50-12.5mg, 100-12.5mg, and 100-25mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Hyzaar® from Merck, which is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Pravastatin Tablets, 10mg, 20mg, 40mg, and 80mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Pravachol® from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is indicated as an adjunct to diets restricting saturated fats and cholesterol.
Temozolomide Capsules, 5mg, 20mg, 100mg, 140mg, 180mg, and 200mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug Temodar® from Schering, which is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

The six products launched had combined U.S. sales of approximately $580 million for the 12 months ending May 2017, according to IMS Health.
ACETO Corporation sells generic prescription products and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products under its Rising label to leading wholesalers, chain drug stores, distributors and mass merchandisers, and the launch of the six products above adds to its significant human pharmaceutical franchise.  Rising Pharmaceuticals has built a commercial portfolio of over 120 products currently in the U.S. market. It also has a development portfolio of more than 50 ANDAs filed with the FDA or pending launch, representing over $7.2 billion in addressable market value, using recent IMS sales data.  
ABOUT ACETO
ACETO Corporation, incorporated in 1947 and with offices and operations in 10 countries, is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products (finished dosage form generics and nutraceuticals), Pharmaceutical Ingredients (pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Performance Chemicals (specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This news release contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the federal securities laws.  The events described in forward-looking statements contained in this news release may not occur.  Generally, these statements relate to our business plans or strategies, projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of ACETO's plans or strategies, financing plans, projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions that ACETO may make, or a projection involving anticipated revenues, earnings or other aspects of ACETO's operating results or financial position, and the outcome of any contingencies.  Any such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections of management. ACETO intends for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "intend," "estimate," and "continue," and their opposites and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company's strategic initiatives including selling finished dosage form generic drugs, and statements regarding the prospects for long-term growth.   ACETO cautions you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond ACETO's control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties discussed in ACETO's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, ACETO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and other filings. Copies of these filings are available at www.sec.gov. 
Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect ACETO's results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by ACETO ultimately prove to be accurate. In addition, periodic high-margin product sales may have a positive material financial impact in a given quarter that may be non-recurring in future quarters, thereby rendering one quarter's performance not useful as a predictor of future quarters' results.   ACETO's actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.  ACETO undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.

PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., July 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACETO Corporation (NASDAQ:ACET), an international company engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals, today announced that Rising Pharmaceuticals, its finished dosage form generics subsidiary, recently launched:







Ramipril Capsules, 1.25mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, and 10mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Altace® from Pfizer, which is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Losartan Potassium Tablets, 25mg and 50mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Cozaar® from Merck, which is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Losartan Potassium and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, 50-12.5mg, 100-12.5mg, and 100-25mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Hyzaar® from Merck, which is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Pravastatin Tablets, 10mg, 20mg, 40mg, and 80mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug, Pravachol® from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is indicated as an adjunct to diets restricting saturated fats and cholesterol.
Temozolomide Capsules, 5mg, 20mg, 100mg, 140mg, 180mg, and 200mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug Temodar® from Schering, which is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets, 2.5mg and 5mg, an FDA-approved generic version of the reference listed drug Zomig-ZMT® from AstraZeneca, which is indicated for the acute treatment of migraines.

The six products launched had combined U.S. sales of approximately $580 million for the 12 months ending May 2017, according to IMS Health.
ACETO Corporation sells generic prescription products and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products under its Rising label to leading wholesalers, chain drug stores, distributors and mass merchandisers, and the launch of the six products above adds to its significant human pharmaceutical franchise.  Rising Pharmaceuticals has built a commercial portfolio of over 120 products currently in the U.S. market. It also has a development portfolio of more than 50 ANDAs filed with the FDA or pending launch, representing over $7.2 billion in addressable market value, using recent IMS sales data.  
ABOUT ACETO
ACETO Corporation, incorporated in 1947 and with offices and operations in 10 countries, is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products (finished dosage form generics and nutraceuticals), Pharmaceutical Ingredients (pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Performance Chemicals (specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products).
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This news release contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the federal securities laws.  The events described in forward-looking statements contained in this news release may not occur.  Generally, these statements relate to our business plans or strategies, projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of ACETO’s plans or strategies, financing plans, projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions that ACETO may make, or a projection involving anticipated revenues, earnings or other aspects of ACETO’s operating results or financial position, and the outcome of any contingencies.  Any such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections of management. ACETO intends for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "intend," "estimate," and "continue," and their opposites and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company’s strategic initiatives including selling finished dosage form generic drugs, and statements regarding the prospects for long-term growth.   ACETO cautions you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond ACETO’s control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties discussed in ACETO’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, ACETO’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and other filings. Copies of these filings are available at www.sec.gov. 
Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect ACETO’s results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by ACETO ultimately prove to be accurate. In addition, periodic high-margin product sales may have a positive material financial impact in a given quarter that may be non-recurring in future quarters, thereby rendering one quarter's performance not useful as a predictor of future quarters' results.   ACETO’s actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.  ACETO undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.

ACETO intends for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "intend," "estimate," and "continue," and their opposites and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company’s strategic initiatives including selling finished dosage form generic drugs, and statements regarding the prospects for long-term growth.   ACETO cautions you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond ACETO’s control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties discussed in ACETO’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, ACETO’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and other filings.

ACETO undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHere's Trump's approval rating in every stateBusiness InsiderHow $39 Gets You A 9 Mins A Day Investing StrategyInvesting DailySponsoredParents railed against the Boy Scouts of America after Trump's campaign-style speechBusiness InsiderFirst ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ Trailer LeakedInvestorPlaceChina is crushing American tech titansYahoo Finance VideoDate Single Women 50+ Near YouOurTimeSponsoredMcDonald's, GM, and Domino's — What you need to know in markets on TuesdayYahoo FinanceObamacare is hurting these people—and Congress is doing nothing about itYahoo FinanceThe Navy's newest, most sophisticated aircraft carrier doesn't have urinalsBusiness InsiderDo You Know The World As Well As You Think?News Daily FeedSponsoredUnder Armour ripped up Jordan Spieth's old contract before he won his first major and gave him a 10-year deal, and it's already paid off big timeBusiness InsiderGoogle's forward guidance trumps earnings any day: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks rangebound ahead of big earningsYahoo FinanceHow (1) Man Turned $50K into $5.3 MillionInvesting DailySponsoredCaterpillar smashes profit estimates, raises 2017 forecast againReutersThe $180 million conflict that kept Scaramucci out of the White House in January has only gotten shadierBusiness InsiderKushner speaks after meeting Senate investigators: ‘I did not collude with Russia’just me: Why should we believe him when there have been so many omissions on his clearance forms and he only makes statements when cornered?Join the Conversation1 / 57.1k
