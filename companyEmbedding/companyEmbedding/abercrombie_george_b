ZIOPHARM Elects George B. Abercrombie, former CEO of Hoffmann-La Roche, to Board of Directors
-- Dr. Murray Brennan Named Chairman of Board --

NEW YORK, Apr 06, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZIOP), announced today the appointment 
      of George B. Abercrombie to its Board of Directors. Mr. Abercrombie will 
      serve as a member of the Board's Compensation Committee as well as the 
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Additionally, Dr. Murray 
      Brennan was elected Chairman of the Board.
Mr. Abercrombie most recently served as the President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) North America and has 
      more than 30 years experience in the pharmaceutical industry. He was 
      responsible for Roche's U.S. and Canadian Pharmaceuticals Business. 
      Under Mr. Abercrombie's leadership, the value of Roche's U.S. business 
      increased, achieving leading market share positions for key marketed 
      products. In joining the ZIOPHARM board, George will also have the 
      opportunity to continue his relationship with Dr. Larry Norton, a 
      consultant partner to ZIOPHARM, with whom he worked closely at Roche and 
      while Dr. Norton was the president of ASCO. Prior to joining Hoffmann-La 
      Roche Inc. in 2001, Mr. Abercrombie held the position of Senior Vice 
      President, Commercial Operations at Glaxo Wellcome Inc. and prior to 
      joining Glaxo, held progressively senior positions at Merck and Company 
      in Merck's Human Health Division in the United States.
During his distinguished career he has testified as an expert witness on 
      numerous occasions in front of both Houses of the U.S. Congress. Mr. 
      Abercrombie began his career as a pharmacist after receiving a 
      bachelor's degree in pharmacy from the University of North Carolina and 
      earned his MBA from Harvard University. He has served on many boards and 
      organizations throughout his career, including the PhRMA (Pharmaceutical 
      Research and Manufacturers of America) Board of Directors, the Johns 
      Hopkins School of Hygiene and the Public Health Advisory, Project Hope 
      Board of Directors, and the Duke University Fuqua School of Business 
      Health Sector Advisory Board, among others.
"Given George's extensive knowledge and understanding of the development 
      and commercialization of pharmaceutical products across a wide range of 
      indications, including those for cancer-related therapies, he will be an 
      invaluable addition to the ZIOPHARM team," stated Dr. Murray Brennan, 
      Chairman of the Board. "ZIOPHARM will no doubt benefit from George's 
      wisdom and experience and we are extremely pleased to have him on board 
      at this important transformational stage of the Company's growth and 
      development."
"This is really an exciting time for ZIOPHARM and me. I am thrilled to 
      be joining this team of enormously impressive professionals who are 
      developing promising medicines to treat cancer," commented Mr. 
      Abercrombie. "I look forward to contributing to ZIOPHARM's success as we 
      build value for patients, shareholders, and the healthcare system."
About ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.:
ZIOPHARM Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the 
      development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of cancer 
      drugs. The Company is currently focused on three clinical programs.
Palifosfamide (ZymafosTM or ZIO-201) references a novel 
      composition (tris formulation) that comprises the functional active 
      metabolite of ifosfamide, a standard of care for treating sarcoma, 
      lymphoma, testicular, and other cancers. Palifosfamide delivers only the 
      cancer fighting component of ifosfamide. It is expected to overcome the 
      resistance seen with ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide, two of the most 
      commonly used DNA-alkylating drugs used to treat cancers. Palifosfamide 
      does not have the toxic metabolites of ifosfamide that cause the 
      debilitating side effects of "fuzzy brain" (encephalopathy) and severe 
      bladder inflammation. It may also have other advantages. Intravenous 
      palifosfamide is currently in a randomized Phase II trial to treat 
      unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma in the front- and 
      second-line setting with the Company having reported interim positive 
      results in late 2009; a registration trial in the same setting is 
      expected to initiate following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      review in the first half of this year. An oral form of palifosfamide has 
      been developed preclinically to the investigational new drug application 
      stage.
Darinaparsin (ZinaparTM or ZIO-101) is a novel 
      mitochondrial-targeted agent (organic arsenic) being developed for the 
      treatment of various hematologic and solid cancers. Preclinical and 
      clinical studies to date have demonstrated that darinaparsin is 
      considerably less toxic than inorganic arsenic, particularly with regard 
      to cardiac toxicity. The Company has reported favorable results from a 
      Phase II trial with IV-administered darinaparsin in lymphoma, 
      particularly peripheral T-cell lymphoma ("PTCL"), at the American 
      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in May of 2009 which would serve as 
      the basis for ongoing clinical study in PTCL following regulatory review 
      and available financial resources Phase I trials with the oral form are 
      ongoing in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors.
Indibulin (ZybulinTM or ZIO-301) is a novel, oral 
      tubulin binding agent that targets both mitosis and cancer cell 
      migration. In addition, indibulin is expected to have several potential 
      benefits, including oral dosing, application in multi-drug resistant 
      tumors, no neuropathy and minimal overall toxicity. In multiple 
      Phase I trials in cancer patients, oral indibulin has been administered 
      both as a single agent and in combination with favorable activity and a 
      promising safety profile that does not include the neurotoxicity seen 
      with all of the other classes of tubulin binding agents. Most recently, 
      results of oral indibulin in combination with oral capecitabine (Xeloda(R)) 
      were presented at last year's American Society of Clinical Oncology 
      (ASCO) along with the preclinical findings of a novel dosing schedule 
      conducted under the direction of Dr. Larry Norton; employing this dosage 
      schedule, the Company expects to initiate a Phase I study early this 
      year in breast cancer patients with the breast team at Memorial Sloan 
      Kettering.
ZIOPHARM's operations are located in Boston, MA with an executive office 
      in New York City. Further information about ZIOPHARM may be found at www.ziopharm.com.

ZIOPHARM Elects George B. Abercrombie, former CEO of Hoffmann-La Roche, to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































ZIOPHARM Elects George B. Abercrombie, former CEO of Hoffmann-La 
      Roche, to Board of Directors




-- Dr. Murray Brennan Named Chairman of Board --






April 06, 2010 08:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZIOP), announced today the appointment 
      of George B. Abercrombie to its Board of Directors. Mr. Abercrombie will 
      serve as a member of the Board’s Compensation Committee as well as the 
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Additionally, Dr. Murray 
      Brennan was elected Chairman of the Board.
    


      Mr. Abercrombie most recently served as the President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) North America and has 
      more than 30 years experience in the pharmaceutical industry. He was 
      responsible for Roche’s U.S. and Canadian Pharmaceuticals Business. 
      Under Mr. Abercrombie’s leadership, the value of Roche’s U.S. business 
      increased, achieving leading market share positions for key marketed 
      products. In joining the ZIOPHARM board, George will also have the 
      opportunity to continue his relationship with Dr. Larry Norton, a 
      consultant partner to ZIOPHARM, with whom he worked closely at Roche and 
      while Dr. Norton was the president of ASCO. Prior to joining Hoffmann-La 
      Roche Inc. in 2001, Mr. Abercrombie held the position of Senior Vice 
      President, Commercial Operations at Glaxo Wellcome Inc. and prior to 
      joining Glaxo, held progressively senior positions at Merck and Company 
      in Merck’s Human Health Division in the United States.
    

      During his distinguished career he has testified as an expert witness on 
      numerous occasions in front of both Houses of the U.S. Congress. Mr. 
      Abercrombie began his career as a pharmacist after receiving a 
      bachelor’s degree in pharmacy from the University of North Carolina and 
      earned his MBA from Harvard University. He has served on many boards and 
      organizations throughout his career, including the PhRMA (Pharmaceutical 
      Research and Manufacturers of America) Board of Directors, the Johns 
      Hopkins School of Hygiene and the Public Health Advisory, Project Hope 
      Board of Directors, and the Duke University Fuqua School of Business 
      Health Sector Advisory Board, among others.
    

      “Given George’s extensive knowledge and understanding of the development 
      and commercialization of pharmaceutical products across a wide range of 
      indications, including those for cancer-related therapies, he will be an 
      invaluable addition to the ZIOPHARM team,” stated Dr. Murray Brennan, 
      Chairman of the Board. “ZIOPHARM will no doubt benefit from George’s 
      wisdom and experience and we are extremely pleased to have him on board 
      at this important transformational stage of the Company’s growth and 
      development.”
    

      “This is really an exciting time for ZIOPHARM and me. I am thrilled to 
      be joining this team of enormously impressive professionals who are 
      developing promising medicines to treat cancer,” commented Mr. 
      Abercrombie. “I look forward to contributing to ZIOPHARM’s success as we 
      build value for patients, shareholders, and the healthcare system.”
    

About ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.:


      ZIOPHARM Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the 
      development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of cancer 
      drugs. The Company is currently focused on three clinical programs.
    

      Palifosfamide (ZymafosTM or ZIO-201) references a novel 
      composition (tris formulation) that comprises the functional active 
      metabolite of ifosfamide, a standard of care for treating sarcoma, 
      lymphoma, testicular, and other cancers. Palifosfamide delivers only the 
      cancer fighting component of ifosfamide. It is expected to overcome the 
      resistance seen with ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide, two of the most 
      commonly used DNA-alkylating drugs used to treat cancers. Palifosfamide 
      does not have the toxic metabolites of ifosfamide that cause the 
      debilitating side effects of “fuzzy brain” (encephalopathy) and severe 
      bladder inflammation. It may also have other advantages. Intravenous 
      palifosfamide is currently in a randomized Phase II trial to treat 
      unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma in the front- and 
      second-line setting with the Company having reported interim positive 
      results in late 2009; a registration trial in the same setting is 
      expected to initiate following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      review in the first half of this year. An oral form of palifosfamide has 
      been developed preclinically to the investigational new drug application 
      stage.
    

      Darinaparsin (ZinaparTM or ZIO-101) is a novel 
      mitochondrial-targeted agent (organic arsenic) being developed for the 
      treatment of various hematologic and solid cancers. Preclinical and 
      clinical studies to date have demonstrated that darinaparsin is 
      considerably less toxic than inorganic arsenic, particularly with regard 
      to cardiac toxicity. The Company has reported favorable results from a 
      Phase II trial with IV-administered darinaparsin in lymphoma, 
      particularly peripheral T-cell lymphoma (“PTCL”), at the American 
      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in May of 2009 which would serve as 
      the basis for ongoing clinical study in PTCL following regulatory review 
      and available financial resources Phase I trials with the oral form are 
      ongoing in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors.
    

      Indibulin (ZybulinTM or ZIO-301) is a novel, oral 
      tubulin binding agent that targets both mitosis and cancer cell 
      migration. In addition, indibulin is expected to have several potential 
      benefits, including oral dosing, application in multi-drug resistant 
      tumors, no neuropathy and minimal overall toxicity. In multiple 
      Phase I trials in cancer patients, oral indibulin has been administered 
      both as a single agent and in combination with favorable activity and a 
      promising safety profile that does not include the neurotoxicity seen 
      with all of the other classes of tubulin binding agents. Most recently, 
      results of oral indibulin in combination with oral capecitabine (Xeloda®) 
      were presented at last year’s American Society of Clinical Oncology 
      (ASCO) along with the preclinical findings of a novel dosing schedule 
      conducted under the direction of Dr. Larry Norton; employing this dosage 
      schedule, the Company expects to initiate a Phase I study early this 
      year in breast cancer patients with the breast team at Memorial Sloan 
      Kettering.
    

      ZIOPHARM’s operations are located in Boston, MA with an executive office 
      in New York City. Further information about ZIOPHARM may be found at www.ziopharm.com.

            A judge has given final approval to a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch relating to $25 hard copy promotional gift cards that stated "No expiration date" on the cards. Abercrombie & Fitch, which denies any wrongdoing, has restored 70% of the original remaining value on those promotional gift cards, which Abercrombie & Fitch issued as part of a 2009 winter holiday promotion and a 2010 spring promotion and later voided. The restored value on the cards may be redeemed at any store of the brand that issued the card (or, in the case of Gilly Hicks, at Hollister) until October 18, 2017. For more information about the settlement, please visit: www.abercrombieclassaction.com.
