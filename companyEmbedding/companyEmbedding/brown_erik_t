The store will be open again weekends in May 2014. It will be open full time, seven days a week from Memorial Day until Labor Day in September. After Labor Day, the hours will be variable depending upon the weather and the number of tourists that remain in Homer.  Hope to see you around next year.

Just Released Let Us Be Brave
An Alaskan Story of Special Olympians United to Survive
by Linda Kay Thompson A dramatic bush plane crash in coastal Alaska leaves the pilot injured. The passengers, a team of Special Olympic Athletes, must fend for themselves to survive. An Alaska storm first threatens to overwhelm them during the night as they care for their unconscious pilot. Each must confront the challenges of survival in the wilderness, while transcending their limitations. Forced to overcome their habits of dependency and help each other, the group finds courage in the Olympic oath: “Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.”


Brown Bear Products is a family business first set up in 1998 to show and sell art by Erik David Behnke. His mother, Linda Kay Thompson, is also a writer and artist but worked on her art part time while she was a full time intensive needs high school teacher.  She retired in 2012 and is now free to work full time on her art interests, one of which is writing.  They both enjoy living on the coast of beautiful Kachemak Bay in Homer, Alaska. Erik has had art shows across the United States in Washington DC, Manhattan, Boston, Kansas City, Spokane, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Phoenix and many others. You can learn more about Erik’s career in the About Erik section of this website. Linda started her writing career developing historical reports for publication as a federal and state researcher. As a single mother, she wrote for enjoyment for years and has published two non-fiction books: Erik’s Story, finding his gifts against all odds in rural Alaska, and It’s Okay Mom, an Alaska story of trust, love of family and triumph over adversity.  She has a new book for 2014 called, Let Us Be Brave, An Alaska Story of Special Olympians Uniting to Survive.  You can read more about her books in the Products section and under Books of this website. They spend their winters working on art that they sell in the summer months in their small gallery on Homer Spit.  You can see pictures of the store in the store section of this website. Jewelry, and fiber arts by Linda can be found on “Linda’s Art” page can be also found in the store during the summer months.  They hope you enjoy perusing their art and website.
