Product launch is an intense, stressful time, but careful planning can help reduce your stress and give your team a solid plan to help manage the intensity. If you cover these four issues early in the planning process, your launch will be easier to manage and less frustrating overall. It will also have better odds of success, leading to a better company position over time.
1. Know Your Audience
When you think of the audience for your product, how specific is it? Do you have a very general idea of who your customer base is -- women, for example, or small business owners -- or have you drilled down deep into your customer profile?
The most successful products are carefully targeted in very specific ways at very specific customers. Take the example of cell phones. While nearly everyone in the world has a cellphone, these mobile phones were initially a very niche product, marketed towards traveling businesspeople who needed a way to contact the office from the road.
Part of building your launch is figuring out exactly who your audience is. You should know demographic details about your customer profile (age, gender, marital status, occupation, hobbies), as well as habitual information (where do they get their news, what is their favorite publication, how do they spend their free time). Knowing these details will help you understand where to find your customer and how to connect with them.
2. Solve the Right Problem
Every product on the market needs to solve a problem. The easiest products to market exist where customers know they have a problem and are seeking a solution. Some products need to convince customers they have a problem, and that the product is a solution; these products have an uphill climb towards success.
The better you know your audience, the easier it will be to identify their problems in a language they understand. For example, targeting a baby product that entertains a very young baby and gives parents a chance to set them down will not be as useful to a parent who intensely values baby wearing and intensive skin-to-skin time. There are other parents, however, who will be extremely appreciative of your product; the key is knowing where to find them.
Identify exactly what problem you are solving, and make sure that your audience agrees that the problem exists before you get too far into your launch.
3. Careful Positioning Against Your Competition
Every product has competition. Even industries that are being disrupted are competing against the status quo. To successfully launch a product, you need to know what your business is working against. If your customers were not using your products or services, whose would they be using?
Sometimes the answer is another company offering the same services; in this case, your position points might revolve around pricing, value adds, and service capabilities. Sometimes the answer is another product in the same class. For example, each movie that comes out competes not just against other movies, but against all the other things people do with their free time. To convince people to go see the newest blockbuster thriller, studios must convince their potential audience that the movie is worth their time.
When you know your audience, and you understand what problem you are solving, positioning your product will be easier and more accurate. You will better understand where to place ads, what content will be helpful in marketing, and how to connect with your audience. If you find yourself unsure of how to accomplish these tasks, returning to the basic ideas of audience and problem will often narrow your position.
4. Feedback
One of the most key elements of a product launch is getting feedback from your customers. You can do all of the theoretical assessments on your audience before launch, but nothing will compare to real feedback from your actual customers. While not every piece of feedback you receive needs to be acted upon immediately, watching customer feedback for trends and patterns will help you identify the next stage of your product evolution.
During the actual launch, it's important to course correct as necessary, but not to try and implement new features or perfect the product prior to launch. Seth Godin always talks about the importance of shipping, and how our fear of shipping gets in the way of actually getting a business off the ground.
If customers are providing feedback about the service they're receiving or the actual functionality of your product or service, you will probably need to fix this as soon as possible. If customers are asking for more functionality, additional benefits, or more perks, you will probably have more success tracking these requests for later implementation.
Product launch is a stressful time for a business owner or entrepreneur, but it is not the end point of the business structure. By planning for a product launch, you can make sure that your launch is as successful as possible, and modify the plan as necessary to continue into the next phase of development.
What advice would you offer to a company planning its first product launch?

Product marketing is the process of promoting and selling a product to an audience. Product marketing, as opposed to product management, deals with more outbound marketing or customer-facing tasks (in the older sense of the phrase). For example, product management deals with the basics of product development within a firm, whereas product marketing deals with marketing the product to prospects, customers, and others. Product marketing, as a job function within a firm, also differs from other marketing jobs such as marketing communications ("marcom"), online marketing, advertising, marketing strategy, and public relations, although product marketers may use channels such as online for outbound marketing for their product.
A product market is something that is referred to when pitching a new product to the general public. Product market definition focuses on a narrow statement: the product type, customer needs (functional needs), customer type, and geographic area.

Role[edit]
Product marketing in a Business addresses four important strategic questions:[1]

What products will be offered (i.e., the breadth and depth of the product line)?
Who will be the target customers (i.e., the boundaries of the market segments to be served)?
How will the products reach those customers (i.e., the distribution channel and are there viable possibilities that create a solid business model)?
At what price should the products be offered?

To inform these decisions, Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) act as the Voice of the Customer to the rest of the product team and company. This includes gaining a deep understanding of—and driving—customer engagement with the product, throughout their lifecycle (pre-adoption, post adoption/purchase, and after churning). PMMs collect this customer information through customer surveys and interviews, and when available, product usage data. This frequently informs the future product roadmap, as well as driving customer product education to ensure improved engagement.
PMMs answer these questions and execute on the strategy using the following tools and methods:

Customer insights: interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer observation
Data analysis: product marketing managers are highly quantitative, particularly in internet companies where results of marketing attribution to revenue is easily measured
Product validation: particularly for internet companies, teams often use marketing as a channel to test and validate product ideas (the minimum viable product or rapid prototyping), before engineering resources are committed to develop the product
Testing: optimal prices and marketing touch points are developed through exhaustive A/B testing of language (copy), prices, product line-ups, visuals, and more

Comparison with product management[edit]
Product marketing frequently differs from product management in high-tech companies. Whereas the product manager is required to take a product's requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a product requirements document (PRD),[2] which will be used by the engineering team to build the product, the product marketing manager can be engaged in the task of creating a market requirements document (MRD), which is used as source for the product management to develop the PRD.
In other companies the product manager creates both the MRDs and the PRDs, while the product marketing manager does outbound tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows, creating marketing collateral like hot-sheets, beat-sheets, cheat sheets, data sheets, and white papers. This requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis, market research, and technical writing, but also in more business oriented activities like conducting ROI and NPV analyses on technology investments, strategizing how the decision criteria of the prospects or customers can be changed so that they buy the company's product vis-a-vis the competitor's product, etc.
One issue that faces Product Marketers is that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents (sales, marcom, customers, blogs, etc.). Creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content.
In smaller high-tech firms or start-ups, product marketing and product management functions can be blurred, and both tasks may be borne by one individual. However, as the company grows someone needs to focus on creating good requirements documents for the engineering team, whereas someone else needs to focus on how to analyze the market, influence the "analysts", and understand longer term market direction. When such clear demarcation becomes visible, the former falls under the domain of product management, and the latter, under product marketing. In Silicon Valley, in particular, product marketing professionals have considerable domain experience in a particular market or technology or both. Some Silicon Valley firms have titles such as Product Marketing Engineer.
The trend that is emerging in Silicon Valley is for companies to hire a team of a product marketing manager with a technical marketing manager. The Technical marketing role is becoming more valuable as companies become more competitive and seek to reduce costs and time to market. Another trend is to have one Product Marketing Manager per group of Product Managers. This is the model that leads to the issue of PMMs being pressured to write content instead of connecting with the market.
In health care marketing products are rarely purchased by the end user and are often purchased or paid for by government, intermediaries, payors, healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as a result in the Biotech/Pharmaceutical and Medical Device markets there are "6" P's; the core 4: Price, Product, Promotion and Positioning as well as: Politics and Perception.
Conferences for product marketing[edit]
Product marketing-specific conferences are hard to come by, though several have emerged recently.

Product Marketing Summit - An annual, all-virtual conference that's free for a limited time. The Summit features speakers and interviews with product marketers from companies like Salesforce, Uber, Zendesk, Evernote, Google, etc. The Summit also has an active product marketing blog and email newsletter.
Product Marketing Community - Physical events in Toronto, Boston, San Francisco and Austin.

Qualifications[edit]
The typical education qualification for this area of business is a high level Marketing or Business related degree, e.g. an BBA, MBA, M.A./M.S. in Marketing, M.A./M.S. in I/O Psychology, not forgetting sufficient work experience in related areas. As a key skill is to be able to interact with technical staff, a background in engineering or computing is also an asset, given the highly quantitative component of the role.

One issue that faces Product Marketers is that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents (sales, marcom, customers, blogs, etc.). Creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content.
In smaller high-tech firms or start-ups, product marketing and product management functions can be blurred, and both tasks may be borne by one individual. However, as the company grows someone needs to focus on creating good requirements documents for the engineering team, whereas someone else needs to focus on how to analyze the market, influence the "analysts", and understand longer term market direction. When such clear demarcation becomes visible, the former falls under the domain of product management, and the latter, under product marketing. In Silicon Valley, in particular, product marketing professionals have considerable domain experience in a particular market or technology or both. Some Silicon Valley firms have titles such as Product Marketing Engineer.
The trend that is emerging in Silicon Valley is for companies to hire a team of a product marketing manager with a technical marketing manager. The Technical marketing role is becoming more valuable as companies become more competitive and seek to reduce costs and time to market. Another trend is to have one Product Marketing Manager per group of Product Managers. This is the model that leads to the issue of PMMs being pressured to write content instead of connecting with the market.
In health care marketing products are rarely purchased by the end user and are often purchased or paid for by government, intermediaries, payors, healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as a result in the Biotech/Pharmaceutical and Medical Device markets there are "6" P's; the core 4: Price, Product, Promotion and Positioning as well as: Politics and Perception.
Conferences for product marketing[edit]
Product marketing-specific conferences are hard to come by, though several have emerged recently.

Product Marketing Summit - An annual, all-virtual conference that's free for a limited time. The Summit features speakers and interviews with product marketers from companies like Salesforce, Uber, Zendesk, Evernote, Google, etc. The Summit also has an active product marketing blog and email newsletter.
Product Marketing Community - Physical events in Toronto, Boston, San Francisco and Austin.

Qualifications[edit]
The typical education qualification for this area of business is a high level Marketing or Business related degree, e.g. an BBA, MBA, M.A./M.S. in Marketing, M.A./M.S. in I/O Psychology, not forgetting sufficient work experience in related areas. As a key skill is to be able to interact with technical staff, a background in engineering or computing is also an asset, given the highly quantitative component of the role.

Product marketing is the process of promoting and selling a product to an audience. Product marketing, as opposed to product management, deals with more outbound marketing or customer-facing tasks (in the older sense of the phrase). For example, product management deals with the basics of product development within a firm, whereas product marketing deals with marketing the product to prospects, customers, and others. Product marketing, as a job function within a firm, also differs from other marketing jobs such as marketing communications ("marcom"), online marketing, advertising, marketing strategy, and public relations, although product marketers may use channels such as online for outbound marketing for their product.
A product market is something that is referred to when pitching a new product to the general public. Product market definition focuses on a narrow statement: the product type, customer needs (functional needs), customer type, and geographic area.

Role[edit]
Product marketing in a Business addresses four important strategic questions:[1]

What products will be offered (i.e., the breadth and depth of the product line)?
Who will be the target customers (i.e., the boundaries of the market segments to be served)?
How will the products reach those customers (i.e., the distribution channel and are there viable possibilities that create a solid business model)?
At what price should the products be offered?

To inform these decisions, Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) act as the Voice of the Customer to the rest of the product team and company. This includes gaining a deep understanding of—and driving—customer engagement with the product, throughout their lifecycle (pre-adoption, post adoption/purchase, and after churning). PMMs collect this customer information through customer surveys and interviews, and when available, product usage data. This frequently informs the future product roadmap, as well as driving customer product education to ensure improved engagement.
PMMs answer these questions and execute on the strategy using the following tools and methods:

Customer insights: interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer observation
Data analysis: product marketing managers are highly quantitative, particularly in internet companies where results of marketing attribution to revenue is easily measured
Product validation: particularly for internet companies, teams often use marketing as a channel to test and validate product ideas (the minimum viable product or rapid prototyping), before engineering resources are committed to develop the product
Testing: optimal prices and marketing touch points are developed through exhaustive A/B testing of language (copy), prices, product line-ups, visuals, and more

Comparison with product management[edit]
Product marketing frequently differs from product management in high-tech companies. Whereas the product manager is required to take a product's requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a product requirements document (PRD),[2] which will be used by the engineering team to build the product, the product marketing manager can be engaged in the task of creating a market requirements document (MRD), which is used as source for the product management to develop the PRD.
In other companies the product manager creates both the MRDs and the PRDs, while the product marketing manager does outbound tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows, creating marketing collateral like hot-sheets, beat-sheets, cheat sheets, data sheets, and white papers. This requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis, market research, and technical writing, but also in more business oriented activities like conducting ROI and NPV analyses on technology investments, strategizing how the decision criteria of the prospects or customers can be changed so that they buy the company's product vis-a-vis the competitor's product, etc.

Some Silicon Valley firms have titles such as Product Marketing Engineer.
The trend that is emerging in Silicon Valley is for companies to hire a team of a product marketing manager with a technical marketing manager. The Technical marketing role is becoming more valuable as companies become more competitive and seek to reduce costs and time to market. Another trend is to have one Product Marketing Manager per group of Product Managers. This is the model that leads to the issue of PMMs being pressured to write content instead of connecting with the market.
In health care marketing products are rarely purchased by the end user and are often purchased or paid for by government, intermediaries, payors, healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as a result in the Biotech/Pharmaceutical and Medical Device markets there are "6" P's; the core 4: Price, Product, Promotion and Positioning as well as: Politics and Perception.
Conferences for product marketing[edit]
Product marketing-specific conferences are hard to come by, though several have emerged recently.

Product Marketing Summit - An annual, all-virtual conference that's free for a limited time. The Summit features speakers and interviews with product marketers from companies like Salesforce, Uber, Zendesk, Evernote, Google, etc. The Summit also has an active product marketing blog and email newsletter.
Product Marketing Community - Physical events in Toronto, Boston, San Francisco and Austin.

Qualifications[edit]
The typical education qualification for this area of business is a high level Marketing or Business related degree, e.g. an BBA, MBA, M.A./M.S. in Marketing, M.A./M.S. in I/O Psychology, not forgetting sufficient work experience in related areas. As a key skill is to be able to interact with technical staff, a background in engineering or computing is also an asset, given the highly quantitative component of the role.

So you've invented the next great gadget, and you're sure it'll be a hit. In fact, you've got cartons of inventory stored in every room of your house that you're itching to sell, sell, sell. Your test market said they love it, but how can you reach the legions of consumers you're sure will want to buy it?Welcome to Sales 101. While there are countless books you can read about sales and marketing, here's a relatively simple, proven strategy that'll teach you how to market a product and grow your sales.Create a Sales PlanFirst, define your market as accurately as possible so you have a deeper understanding of exactly who you're selling to. For example, instead of all women, it may be working women with above-average incomes and kids under age 5. Instead of all men, it may be divorced men in their 40s with six-figure salaries. The more specific you get, the more accurately you'll be able to target your sales and marketing efforts, choosing the sales channels most receptive to your product.Next, you'll need to develop a sales plan. Before you groan, "Another plan," understand this can be a simple document for your eyes only that'll help you organize and think through your sales strategy. Write it in a way that makes sense for you. Typically, it should include the following:Sales goals: These goals should be specific and measurable, not something like selling a million units. Base them on the nature of your product and try to break them down into manageable parts. For example, sell 50 units to end-users in 30 days and sell 100 units to local independent retailers in six months.Sales activities: These are your tactics--how you plan to make the sale. You may say you'll sell direct-to-consumer through a website or via craft shows, for instance. Or this part of the plan may include activities like developing a sell sheet to send to independent retail stores.Target accounts: Your sales plan should also include the accounts you want to sell to. If it's end-users, for example, plan how you're going to reach them through eBay, classified ads or your website.Timelines: Put dates to all of the above elements so you can define your steps within a realistic timeline. Don't forget that your timelines should be fluid--if you're underachieving, your sales plan can help you figure out why and define the corrective steps you need to take.Finally, follow a proven process for growing sales over time. While it would be fabulous to have Wal-Mart carry your product right out of the gate, it may not be realistic. Most large retailers want to see a track record of successful sales before agreeing to take on a new product. Build Your MarketTo learn how to bring a product to market, begin by selling directly to end-users. This'll give you confidence that there's demand for your product and will also create referenceable customers that you can contact for product and packaging feedback before you hit the bigger leagues. So where can you reach your end-users?The web is one highly effective channel, and you can reach your market through your own website or via a site like eBay. You can also tap into your own personal network as you begin. Host a home party to share your product with friends and friends-of-friends, sell through local community groups and e-mail your network.Once you get feedback directly from your customers, refine the packaging and price point before approaching your next market--wholesalers. You'll probably start with small, independently owned, local stores. It's a good idea to start with them before hitting larger chain stores because it's easier to get in touch with the direct decision-maker, and they're more inclined to take on new, unique or hard-to-find items to differentiate themselves from larger stores. To sell to these retailers, be prepared and bring a product sell sheet, photos, product samples (if possible) and a succinct introductory letter to explain what's in it for them, highlighting your product's profit margin, features and benefits, and proven sales record.Expand to New MarketsOnce you've established sales strength with independent retailers and are ready to support new markets, it's time to sell to the big guns. Of course, exactly who those big guns are will depend on your product. For some, it's powerhouse general mass retailers, like Wal-Mart and Target, while other products will fit more specialized but equally powerful retailers, like Williams-Sonoma, The Sharper Image and Sephora.Note that when dealing with these major accounts, the sale is just the beginning of the deal. Handling fulfillment, returns, rollbacks, slotting fees, advertising and more will require strengthening your business's infrastructure and resources.But back to the sale. What's the best way to approach a larger retailer? Here's a quick cheat sheet:Get the correct buyer: One of your biggest challenges is finding the right buyer within a large organization, so do your homework. If you're experiencing roadblocks, consider hiring a distributor or manufacturer's rep who already has established relationships in your industry.Be prepared: Develop a presentation and have professional-looking sell sheets ready. Your product should also have packaging that's ready to go.Know your target: Understand what products they already carry and how yours will fit in. Don't waste your time pitching to a retailer who's unlikely to carry your product.Take advantage of special programs: Some mass retailers, such as Wal-Mart, have local purchase programs that give managers authority to try local items. And other retailers may have different initiatives, such as minority business programs.Be patient: It can take up to a year or longer before you see your product on store shelves, so don't get frustrated. And if the final answer is no, try to turn it into a learning experience.Finally, remember there are other sales channels besides the traditional brick-and-mortar retail store. Catalogs, TV shopping networks and online stores can also be excellent methods to enable you to learn how to market a product online.

Reader ApprovedwikiHow to Market a Product
Three Parts:Designing Your BrandReaching Your MarketExpanding Your BusinessCommunity Q&A
You want to get your product out there so everyone can see how great it is...but that's harder than it sounds! How do you market a product? Read below for some advice, strategies, and general information on how to market a product.







Steps


Part 1

Designing Your Brand







1

Keep it up-to-date. Make sure all of your designs are kept up to date. Who wants to go to a beauty parlor with a sign from the 1980’s or buy from a website which looks like it’s hosted on Geocities (people under the age of 22 may need to look that up).









2

Hire a graphic designer. Don’t make your product packaging and logo yourself unless you have extensive design and artistic experience. Having attractive branding and graphic design is extremely important and is really best left to the pros. Commission a graphic designer (you can find a cheap one by inquiring at the local art college) to do your designs for you.








3

Design a logo. You will need a logo for your company and product if you do not have one already. Make sure it is easy to read, simple to print, easily memorable, and versatile. Your graphic designer should be able to help you come up with something.


The most successful logos use bold lines and dynamic shapes. Think the Pepsi logo, the Nike logo, or the Batman symbol.








4

Design unforgettable product packaging. You will need labels and other visuals on your packaging and these should be similarly well designed as your logo. The packaging will need to be attractive, appropriate to your product and company image, and easily recognizable.


Remember: if someone can't remember what you're product is called when they describe it to people, they're probably going to say something like, "Go to the blank aisle and you'll see it on the shelf: it's the thing in the purple package with the cool, white swirly design".










Part 2

Reaching Your Market







1

Have a website. The most important thing these days, when it comes to marketing a product, is having a website. This will give you a wider audience than any other type of marketing, is relatively cheap, and lends legitimacy to your business. It will also be necessary for some of the more effective marketing methods. If you really want your website to help you succeed, enable the sale of your product through the site.


The simplest way to sell your product through your website will be to have an Amazon store where the product is available and use the storefront widget or link to the product on your site.








2

Make a press release. For certain types of products, a press release might be a good idea. Find a media which is related to (ie. whose audience would be excited about) the type of product you are selling and give them a press release about your product becoming available. This is best for brand new products, especially those which are innovative in some way.








3

Maximize social media. Social media is a powerful marketing tool. You can use your own contacts to spread the word about your product (across Twitter, Facebook, or even sites like Pinterest) or you can use social media’s internal advertising (such as Facebook ads and sponsored posts).


Most products can easily benefit from a Facebook page or Facebook ads. It is a very versatile marketing tool. Make a business page or a fanpage for your product. From there you can have promotions or place ads using Facebook's internal systems.
Twitter is also a versatile advertising tool. Use it to alert your customers to sales and business developments (now you can buy Cool Product at your local Awesome Store!). Try to mix it up by also posting cool things that are only slightly related to your business, to keep your feed interesting to people.
Certain types of products can make use of a Pinterest marketing campaign. Maybe you make clothes and you can show how to make great outfits using your product, or how to modify and personalize your product. Maybe you make a food product and you can show recipes that make use of your product.








4

Use internet ads. Another great marketing tool is internet banner ads. These ads, which would go up on websites which meet your audience criteria and budget, can funnel traffic into your website, allowing you to tell potential customers all about the wonders of your product.


Use a reliable service to set up internet advertising (such as Project Wonderful) or work out a deal with local website owners if your product is better for a local audience.








5

Be smart about email marketing. If you have a website, consider an email marketing campaign. Send a well-crafted email telling these people why they should purchase your product, where they can get it, and give them a great hook (such as a sale) to draw them in. Remember: don’t be spammy!


Collect the emails of customers during sales of either new or old products, purchase emails from a reputable service, or target specifically to interested parties who might be able to get the word out if they enjoy your product.








6

Utilize digital coupons. People love to feel like they’re getting a great deal on something. Use digital coupons to draw customers in. You can use codes, print-out coupons for customers to bring to your store, or digital QR codes which can be displayed on a phone and scanned.








7

Don't forget flyers, pamphlets, and postcards. You can also use more traditional methods of getting the word out. These methods work best for advertising and gaining customers in your local area. Make sure that your ad is easy to understand, looks attractive, and has some kind of hook to draw customers in. Flyers and pamphlets can be handed out or posted in allocated spots (such as store windows). Pamphlets and postcards can be mailed to street addresses in your local area.








8

Use print advertising. You can also advertise in local print media. Get your ad in a newspaper, magazine, or other print media like phone books and real estate guides. This is easy to do, as you need only contact the advertising department for the companies which produce your chosen publication.

Consider television ads. If you have a large amount of money to produce a good television ad and get it to play on local television, this can be a good way to advertise to a broad audience. Unless you have very large amounts of money, however, you will probably be limited to local channels or daytime television, so only use this method if you think your ad will reach people who would actually buy your product.










Part 3

Expanding Your Business







1

Become an expert in your market. Conduct research about your target market. You can look up information online or at a library, or you can conduct your own experiments by polling members of your target market or giving them samples to try to review.


Make sure to consider what your target market should be. Certain demographics to consider include age, gender, education level, location, interests, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.








2

Perfect your product for the market. Once you have some feedback about your product and more information about your target market, make any changes that seem appropriate to perfect it for your market.


Remember that while you will get widely differing opinions, if there are common criticisms of your product, they are probably correct and should be addressed.








3

Determine your startup budget. Think about how much money you will have to market your product in the beginning. This will determine what type of marketing you do and sometimes what strategy you use.








4

Develop sales goals. You will need to determine how much of your product at what price will need to sell in order to keep your business afloat. This is very, very important. Balancing this will be tricky and it may take some time to figure out the right formula.








5

Develop a sales plan. This is when you will need to write out and specify your sales timeline, target market needs, priorities, objectives, challenges, how you will acquire new business, and how you will grow your existing business. A sales plan will be necessary if you want investors to consider your product.








6

Choose a strategy to succeed. There are a number of different ways you can market your product, or different approaches in who you market to and what aspect of people you appeal to in your marketing. These strategies can bring you widely different customers or they can help you soar with a specific set of people.


Consider a concentrated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing appeals to and is targeted at only your target market. This is commonly seen with luxury items, which get marketed to very specific parts of a population, but can also be seen in other areas as well. Think Teen Magazine.
Consider an undifferentiated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing appeals to and is targeted at pretty much everybody, and certainly a very broad audience. This strategy works well when you have a product which is broadly useful or appealing. Usually this means the traditional marketing mediums: television ads, print ads, and billboards for example.
Consider a differentiated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing takes different aspects of your product and markets it to different demographics. Use the price, for example, to market to customers with a limited budget who may be looking for something less costly than your competitor’s products. Meanwhile, use convenience to make your product appeal to a local market.








7

Seed your market. Give samples, trials, or introductory sales to show your customer base why they want your product. You can do this by handing out samples outside your store, or finding a complementary business with whom your product can be paired with for short run, among a number of other ways. This will help build your initial business base and is very important.


Continue to test your marketing strategy as you go through this initial phase, to ensure that you are taking the right approach for your market.








8

Expand your market. Once you’ve had a certain measure of success and you feel your product is ready, you can expand your market by getting your product into major retailers. You will want to consider where you should sell (Walmart, etc.). Following the advice in the Serious Success section will be very important, as stores will not want to carry your product if they feel you are unprepared to handle the volume.[1]

Tips


Appealing to customers emotions is a great way to market. Find the appropriate emotion to appeal to, such as their love of family time, and design marketing campaigns around that.





Warnings


Don’t get too enamoured with your own ideas. Your customers may have better ones and if you can’t change to fit their ideas, your business will fail. Just look at Microsoft with the Xbox One.

The 10 Commandments of Product Marketing








The 10 Commandments of Product Marketing

May 16, 2014


Whether you’re a fan of Charlton Heston or Mel Brooks, you likely understand the concept of a commandment: It is a foundational command or directive or an essential requirement with no compromise. In the course of managing today’s crises and worrying about tomorrow’s problems, we as product-marketing professionals can lose focus on the essentials needed to be an effective product marketer.
Having been at the product-marketing game for about a dozen years at three different companies (more if you count how many times I was acquired) and having had the distinct honor of working for a master of product marketing, I submit to you this list of the essentials, which we call “The 10 Commandments of Product Marketing.” I hope they help guide new product marketers or reintroduce core product-marketing fundamentals to veteran practitioners.
The 10 commandments are built around the constituencies we as product marketers serve: sales, product management and business, press and analysts, competitors, partners and most importantly, customers.
1. Have an up-to-date positioning document and buyer persona for your product. How often do you start developing product or marketing materials without fully knowing who the target buyers are and what their pains are? It happens more than it should when we are going too fast, but without this fundamental understanding you run the risk of losing control of your message. Never forget: YOU own the message.
2. Know the business plan for your product and have a measurable go-to-market plan for it. Regularly perform a marketing activity analysis against budget to measure this. You can’t manage what you can’t measure, and you can’t achieve an objective without understanding what it takes to get there. I recommend setting a regular cadence of operational reviews with your functional marketing counterparts, where you can review a standard set of results to measure what’s working and what’s not. And when marketing issues come up during quarterly business reviews, make sure your business leader is prepared with the numbers. It’s your responsibility as steward of the marketing budget for the business.
3. Know how customers are using your product. Observing customers in their native habitats need not be intimidating. Ask for a ride-along with a sales rep, or talk to an established customer willing to give you honest feedback. (Customer reference program members are an ideal source for this.) Use these conversations to determine if how you’re positioning your product is real or just hype. Be prepared for an opinion different from what you were expecting and take it in context with other conversations. Just because you have one conversation with one customer who says something completely divergent from what your buyer personas say doesn’t mean you have to shift how you market your product. Keep it real by speaking to a real customer at least once per month. This is also a non-threatening way to gather win/loss data.
4. Know where your product’s customers and users are coming from. This one can be tricky, especially if your business lacks the operational maturity to have consolidated business metrics. There will be someone—likely multiple people—who are able to tell you how many active customers you have for a product (maintenance or support records); the sizes and industry verticals of your customers (Hoover’s et al); average sales price, discount and margin (bookings database from finance); and new customers vs. existing (finance). The trick is to consolidate this information so you have the right information when you need it. For example, wouldn’t it be great if—when your business leader indicated you needed to focus on selling to existing customers to drive penetration—you had that data at your fingertips and could weigh in on the addressable market?
5. Know your product’s license and maintenance revenue targets and progress toward those targets. As a product marketer, you are the VP of marketing for your product. The main focus of your role as a marketer is contributing to revenue. How are you influencing license bookings? Pretend for a moment you work for a “company-is-the-product” startup. You own marketing for that product—and therefore the company—soup to nuts. What do you need to know to be successful? Knowing your progress toward targets helps you move your marketing investments to meet current business objectives.
6. Know who sells your product. Also know what their comp plans look like. Sales reps are coin operated; their behavior follows the money. Knowing how your reps are compensated helps you know what to focus on in sales-enablement discussions. For example, if reps have their comp plan tied to growth in enterprise-level accounts in their region, they’re not going to respond to products and training that address a small- to mid-market customer. Hand-in-hand with this is an understanding of quotas, average deal sizes, whether they’re comped on other parts of the portfolio, professional services, etc. This helps you better understand the folks who are taking your product to market and how to talk their language. You can then be better positioned to influence comp-based incentives or spiffs for your product.   7. Ensure sales, partners, field marketing and others can successfully evangelize for your product with accurate and up-to-date sales tools. Gather feedback from the field and provide regular updates. This seems like a no-brainer and will likely be 75 percent of your job. Notice the nuance here, though. Your role as a product marketer likely revolves around building messaging, enabling the sales force and influencing campaigns to drive leads and awareness. But turning other marketing shared-services personnel into advocates for your product increases internal mindshare and ultimately improves focus and results. It’s not just about the blocking and tackling of producing sales tools and a good website, but also ensuring the folks building those tools and that website or managing that event can tell the story well. Part of your success will be dependent on turning others, not just sales, into evangelists. Remember, you’re likely competing with other products for mental shelf space across the company. Be aggressive: It’s always easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
8. Know your product’s top three competitors and be able to explain how your product is different. I bet this is the No. 1 request you get from sales. But if you’re like many companies, analyzing competitors is a tricky undertaking. It’s frowned upon to download a competitor’s product under false pretenses or break the law in any way, so you rely on publicly available materials that are either authored by the competitor or from an expensive third-party source. My advice is to stay above it and simply provide strengths and advantages of your products.
9. Know who the key analysts and market influencers are and how they position your product in the market. Don’t rely exclusively on the analyst relations, public relations or social media teams to give you regular updates on analyst reports or industry articles. You need to take responsibility for knowing who your top influencers are and how they feel about your product, and you can do that by subscribing to their blogs and Twitter feeds. Also, establish a quarterly cadence with those influencers to talk business strategy, product updates, etc. It doesn’t even have to be formal, and some of the best influencing I’ve done is over coffee or standing on a tradeshow floor. Begin with the end in mind: How do you want this conversation to end? Courting these influencers is as critical to your success as educating your sales force. Ever had a deal go south when a customer said that Analyst Firm X hadn’t heard about your product before?
10. Know your product’s release schedule and roadmap and execute product releases on time. Another “duh” moment. But seriously, how many times have you been surprised that a product is ready to release, and you nearly caused a delay in its release? At the company I work for, product management owns the release to marketing/manufacturing date, but product marketing owns the generally available (GA) date when the product is actually live and sellable. There are typically 10 business days between these two dates (with some flexibility on either end), which gives product marketers 10 days to shepherd sales tool updates, marketing programs and sales training through the processes needed to post it all live. To keep up on when the release is coming, attend your product or program manager’s regular release meetings and be prepared with a plan on how you will market the product.
Breaking It Down
Remember the old maxim that you either are in sales or sales support? Master these 10 commandments, and you will be better connected to the business, be able to measure your results with what really matters (bookings), be closer to the customer than you ever thought possible and less likely to have to answer to sales.
Remember, you have execution teams to help you. Leverage them so you can be a marketing representative to the business. Overlaying these commandments on top of the Pragmatic Marketing process—and using the templates and tools available to you—adds rigor, discipline and a professional quality to your role as product marketing and business representative to the marketing department.

What Is Product Marketing?

 Dave GerhardtDecember 3, 2016 


Product Marketing 
●
 5 min read




You’ve heard about the importance of product marketing.
You know a few good product marketers. Heck, maybe that’s even your job.
One problem: try and explain what product marketing does to someone else.
Uhhhh…
Frustrating, isn’t it?
No matter how hard you try to explain what product marketing is and what product marketers do, everyone has a different definition (and this is especially true when you start comparing product marketing vs. product management).
Product marketing sits at the intersection of product, sales and marketing — which means that the role can have a big impact — but also means that the role can be a little challenging to define.
See why thousands of businesses are using Drift to generate lead and close deals faster.
A Definition For Product Marketing
Before a product launch, product marketers typically own positioning, messaging, gathering customer feedback, and the overall go-to-market strategy for a product.
After a product launch, product marketers help with sales enablement and focus on driving demand, adoption and the overall success of the product.

That definition is the best way that we’ve found to explain the role of product marketing — by looking at what product marketers do before and after product launches (and there’s more information in the SlideShare below, too).
 
But we also wanted to created this guide to help explain what product marketing is and what the product marketing job description typically looks like.
So let’s get to it.
The Problem With Defining Product Marketing
Google the term “product marketing” and you’ll see one definition after another trying to capture the essence of what product marketing managers do.
But most of those definitions are either from outdated marketing textbooks or offer contradicting explanations — one might tell you product marketing sits with product; one might tell you product marketing sits with sales.
Some refer to it as “a liaison between the company and the outside world”.
Others try to be more specific, explaining how product marketing deals with the 7P’s of marketing (remember the 7P’s?)
Many focus on what a product marketer must achieve or do while others try to explain it by its role within the company — and not a single one seems to offer a clear enough definition of the term.
But where’s the confusion coming from?
One reason might be the lack of understanding of what product marketers actually do.
Even with little knowledge about their day to day jobs, most of us can understand what outcomes the majority of functions within a company are responsible for delivering.
Sales people bring in more business. Finance keeps the books in order. Engineers build the product. And support helps keep customers happy.
But product marketing… most people might have difficulty defining the outcome of a product marketer’s work.
The other reason might be that many companies use the term product marketing to describe other functions like product management for instance.
In some companies, a product marketer’s sole responsibility is positioning. In others, they focus only on sales enablement or they are responsible for driving demand and adoption. And then at some companies, a product marketer is responsible for all of those things.
So What Is Product Marketing Actually Responsible For?
At its core, product marketers need a deep understanding of the customer and the market, to ensure that:

A product and its new features are appropriately positioned on the market,
Sales and marketing teams have all the necessary knowledge and materials enabling them to attract new customers,
The product could satisfy the target audience’s needs and overcome their pain points,
Product demand and adoption are on continuous rise, and
The product remains relevant as markets evolve.

Product Marketing Deliverables
The tangible results of a product marketer’s work typically include:

Buyer personas that provide structure and insight for a company.
Positioning and messaging that that attracts and converts prospects and leads.
Sales enablement materials that help reps close more deals.
Competitive intelligence that gives the team a deep understanding of the market.
Go-to-market strategy and launch plans that outline in detail how the product will be promoted and sold.

Let’s look at a product marketer’s responsibilities in each stage leading up to a product launch to get a better look at the life of a product marketer.
Stage #1. Customer Development
Pre-launch, a product marketers job is to play a key role in defining the target market and understanding the potential customer.
Stage #2. Positioning & Messaging
After customer development, it’s the product marketer’s job to turn those learnings into something actionable.  This typically comes in the form of a positioning document or a list of key messages. Product marketers try to answer these three questions with their positioning: Who is this product for? What does this product do? Why is this product different than what’s out there?
Stage #3. Teaching Out Positioning & Messaging
Now that positioning and messaging has been developed, it’s the product marketers job to make sure that everyone at the company knows it. Positioning won’t stick unless everyone is on the same page, so it’s important for product marketers to get buy-in and teach out they key messages across the organization.
Stage #4. Creating A Launch Plan
Product marketers own the creation of a launch plan, which typically involves various teams from across an organization, including traditional marketing, sales, support and more. At the end of the day, most product marketers are measured on demand (whether it be new signups, cross-sells or feature adoption) so creating an effective launch plan is critical to a successful launch.
Stage #5. Creating Launch Content
Launch content is the glue to any launch plan.  Product marketers will work with almost every team inside of an organization on launch content, including everything from demo decks to product screenshots, sales materials, blog content, landing pages and website updates.
Stage #6. Preparing The Team
Internal communication can be just as important as external communication for a product launch. It’s the product marketer’s job to make sure the entire time is prepped and ready to go before launch. This usually means everything from making sure the website is ready to go live to making sure that the support team is ready to field calls.
Stage #7. Launch
The launch is the defining moment for a product marketer.  This is when the rubber meets the road and customers start coming in — but the best product marketers are ready to adjust everything for a launch on the fly.
PS. We go in-depth on each one of these steps in our free guide on How To Launch A Product.
Product Marketing vs. Traditional Marketing
Now that you know all that, there still might be one question:
What makes product marketing different from traditional marketing? Aren’t the two de facto the same?
In short, no, they’re not.
Traditional marketing focuses on acquiring and converting customers. Traditional marketers focus on strangers: prospects and leads.
They also promote a company, its brand and ensure the consistency of the marketing message.
Product marketing on the other hand focuses on marketing to customers, driving demand and adoption, all with the goal of creating happy, successful customers.
One of the best way to think about product marketing vs. traditional marketing is by looking at the marketing funnel:

Product Marketing vs. Product Management
We just covered how product marketing and traditional marketing differ, but now it’s time to cover the number one question when it comes to product marketing:
“How is product marketing different than product management?”
Well, contrary to popular belief, they are not responsible for the same things (but you aren’t alone if you’ve ever wondered what they each do).
The quick version goes a little something like this:
If product management’s job is to create and define new products and features, product marketing’s job is to bring those things to market.
But since that still makes things a little fuzzy, we created this infographic to help breakdown the differences between product marketing and product management.

			One thought on “What Is Product Marketing?”		





Hi, Dave! I’m an ex-product marketer, certified Pragmatic Marketing, and I’m doing a research for the product marketing community. In order to get that “deep understanding of the customer and the market” what tools do you use? How do find your customer’s needs? 
While working as a Product Marketing, we had some quarterly market research done by the research team, but they were too expensive. We, the product marketers, what should we do in order to get real or constant feedback from our users? How do you this step @Drift?
Thanks!

 The Marketing Mix: Product

Products come in several forms. Consumer  products can be categorized as convenience goods, for which consumers  are willing to invest very limited shopping efforts. Thus, it is essential to  have these products readily available and have the brand name well known. Shopping goods, in contrast, are goods in  which the consumer is willing to  invest a great deal of time and effort. For example, consumers will spend a great deal of time looking for a new  car or a medical procedure. Specialty goods are those that are of  interest only to a narrow segment of the population—e.g., drilling machines.  Industrial goods can also be broken down into subgroups, depending on their  uses. It should also be noted that, within the context of marketing decisions, the term product refers to more than tangible  goods—a service can be a product, too.

 A firm’s product  line or lines refers to the assortment of similar things that the firm holds. Brother, for example, has both a line of laser  printers and one of typewriters. In contrast,  the firm’s product mix describes the combination of different product  lines that the firm holds. Boeing, for example, has both a commercial aircraft and a defense line of  products that each take advantage of some of the same core competencies and technologies of the firm. Some firms  have one very focused or narrow  product line (e.g., KFC does only chicken right) while others maintain numerous lines that hopefully all have  some common theme. This represents a wide product mix 3M, for example, makes a large assortment of goods that are thought  to be related in the sense that they use the firm’s ability to bond surfaces  together. Depth refers to the variety that is offered within each  product line. Maybelline offers a great deal of depth in lipsticks with subtle  differences in shades while Morton Salt offers few varieties of its product.
Products may be  differentiated in several ways. Some may be represented as being of superior quality (e.g., Maytag),  or they may differ in more arbitrary ways in terms of styles—some people like  one style better than another, while there is no real consensus on which one is  the superior one. Finally, products can be differentiated in terms of offering  different levels of service—for example, Volvo offers a guarantee of free, reliable towing anywhere should the  vehicle break down. American Express offers  services not offered by many other charge cards.

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOLOPMENT
      New product development tends to happen  in stages. Although firms often go back and forth between these idealized  stages, the following sequence is illustrative of  the development of a new product:

New product  strategy development. Different  firms will have different strategies on how to approach new products. Some  firms have stockholders who want to minimize  risk and avoid investing in too many new innovations. Some firms can only survive if they innovate  frequently and have stockholders who are willing to take this risk. For  example, Hewlett-Packard has to  constantly invent new products since competitors learn to work around  its patents and will be able to manufacture the products at a lower cost.
Idea  generation. Firms solicit ideas as to new products it  can make. Ideas might come from customers, employees, consultants, or  engineers. Many firms receive a large number of ideas each year and can only  invest in some of them.
Screening and  evaluation: Some products that after some analysis are  clearly not feasible or are not consistent  with the core competencies of the firm are eliminated.
Business analysis. Ideas are now exposed to more rigorous analysis. Profit projections, risks, market size, and  competitive response are considered. If promising,  market research may be done.
Development: The product is  designed and manufacturing facilities are planned.
Market testing: Frequently, firms will try to “test” a product in one region to see if it will sell in reality before it  is released nationally and internationally.  There is a lesser risk if the firm only commits money to advertising and other marketing efforts in one  region. Retailers will also be more receptive in other parts of the  country and world if it has been demonstrated  that the product sold well in one region. The firm may also experiment  with different prices for the product.
Commercialization: Facilities to manufacture the product on a larger scale are now put into operation and the firm  starts a national marketing campaign and distribution  effort.

THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
      Products often go  through a life cycle. Initially, a product is introduced. 

Since the product is not well known and is  usually expensive (e.g., as microwave ovens were in  the late 1970s), sales are usually limited. Eventually, however, many products reach a growth phase—sales increase  dramatically. More firms enter with their models of the product. Frequently, unfortunately, the product will  reach a maturity stage where little  growth will be seen. For example, in the United States, almost every household has at least one color TV set. Some  products may also reach a decline stage, usually because the  product category is being replaced by something better. For example,  typewriters experienced declining sales as more consumers switched to computers or other word processing  equipment. The product life cycle is tied  to the phenomenon of diffusion of innovation. When a new product comes out, it is  likely to first be adopted by consumers who are more innovative than  others—they are willing to pay a premium  price for the new product and take a risk on unproven technology. It is  important to be on the good side of innovators since many other later adopters will tend to rely for advice on the  innovators who are thought to be more knowledgeable about new products  for advice.
      At later phases of the PLC, the firm may  need to modify its market strategy. For  example, facing a saturated market for baking soda in its traditional use, Arm  & Hammer launched a major campaign to  get consumers to use the product to deodorize  refrigerators. Deodorizing powders to be used before vacuuming were also created.
 It is sometimes useful to think of products as being either new or existing.
      Many firms today rely increasingly on new products for a  large part of their sales. New products can be new in several ways. They can be new to the market—noone else ever made a product  like this before. For example, Chrysler invented the minivan. Products can also  be new to the firm—another firm invented the product, but the firm is now making its own version. For example,  IBM did not invent the personal computer, but entered after other firms showed the market  to have a high potential. Products can be new to the segment—e.g., cellular phones and  pagers were first aimed at physicians and other  price-insensitive segments. Later, firms decided to target the more  price-sensitive mass market. A product can be new for legal purposes. Because consumers tend to be attracted to “new and improved” products, the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) only allows firms to put that label on  reformulated products for six months after a significant change has been made.

DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION
      The diffusion of innovation refers to the tendency of  new products, practices, or ideas to spread  among people.

 Usually, when new products or ideas come about, they are initially only adopted by a small  group of people. Later, many innovations spread  to other people. The bell shaped curve frequently illustrates the rate of adoption of a new product. Cumulative adoptions are reflected  by the S-shaped curve.

 The saturation point is the maximum proportion of consumers  likely to adopt a product. In the  case of refrigerators in the U.S., the saturation level is nearly one hundred percent of households. The figure  will almost certainly be well below that for video games that, even when spread  out to a large part of the population, will be of  interest to far from everyone.


      Several specific  product categories have case histories that illustrate important issues in adoption. Until some time in the  1800s, few physicians bothered to scrub prior to surgery, even though new scientific theories predicted  that small microbes not visible to the naked eye could cause  infection. Younger and more progressive physicians  began scrubbing early on, but they lacked the stature to make their older colleagues  follow.

 ATM cards spread  relatively quickly. Since the cards were used in public, others who did not yet hold the cards  could see how convenient they were. Although some people were concerned about  security, the convenience factors seemed to be a decisive  factor in the “tug-of-war” for and against adoption.
        The case of credit  cards was a bit more complicated and involved a “chicken­and-egg” paradox. Accepting credit cards  was not a particularly attractive option for retailers until they were carried by a large enough  number of consumers. Consumers, in  contrast, were not particularly interested in cards that were not accepted by a  large number of retailers. Thus, it was  necessary to “jump start” the process, signing up large corporate accounts, under favorable terms, early in the cycle,  after which the cards became worthwhile for retailers to accept.
 Rap music initially spread quickly among  urban youths in large part because of the low costs of recording. Later, rap music became  popular among a very different segment, suburban youths, because of its  apparently authentic depiction of an exotic urban  lifestyle.
 Hybrid corn was  adopted only slowly among many farmers. Although hybrid corn provided yields of about 20% more than traditional corn,  many farmers had difficulty believing that  this smaller seed could provide a superior harvest. They were usually  reluctant to try it because a failed harvest could have serious economic consequences, including a possible loss of the  farm. Agricultural extension agents then sought out the most progressive  farmers to try hybrid corn, also aiming for farmers who were most respected and  most likely to be imitated by others. Few farmers switched to hybrid corn  outright from year to year. Instead, many started out with a fraction of their  land, and gradually switched to 100% hybrid corn when this innovation had  proven itself useful.


Several forces often  work against innovation. One is risk, which can be either social or financial. For example, early buyers of the CD player  risked that few CDs would be recorded  before the CD player went the way of the 8 track player. Another
      risk is being perceived by others as  being weird for trying a “fringe” product or idea. For example, Barbara Mandrel sings the  song “I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool.” Other sources of resistance include the initial  effort needed to learn to use new products  (e.g., it takes time to learn to meditate or to learn how to use a computer) and concerns about compatibility with  the existing culture or technology. For  example, birth control is incompatible with religious beliefs that predominate  in some areas, and a computer  database is incompatible with a large, established card file.
 Innovations come in  different degrees. A continuous innovation includes slight improvements over time. Very little  usually changes from year to year in automobiles, and even automobiles of the 1990s are driven  much the same way that automobiles of the 1950 were driven. A dynamically  continuous innovation involves some  change in technology, although the product is used much the same way that its  predecessors were used—e.g., jet vs. propeller aircraft. A discontinuous innovation  involves a product that fundamentally changes the way that things are  done—e.g., the fax and photocopiers. In general, discontinuous  innovations are more difficult to market  since greater changes are required in the way things are done, but the rewards  are also often significant.

Several factors influence the speed with  which an innovation spreads. One issue is  relative advantage (i.e., the ratio of risk or cost to benefits). Some  products, such as cellular phones, fax machines, and ATM cards, have a  strong relative advantage. Other products,  such as automobile satellite navigation systems, entail some advantages, but the cost ratio is high. Lower  priced products often spread more quickly,  and the extent to which the product is trialable (farmers did not have  to plant all their land with hybrid  corn at once, while one usually has to buy a cellular phone to try it out)  influence the speed of diffusion. Finally, the extent of switching difficulties  influences speed—many offices were slow to adopt computers because users had to  learn how to use them.
 Some cultures tend to  adopt new products more quickly than others, based on several factors:

Modernity: The extent to which the culture is receptive to new things. In  some countries, such as Britain and Saudi Arabia, tradition is greatly valued—thus, new products often don’t fare too  well. The United States, in contrast, tends to value progress.
Homophily: The more similar to each other that members of a culture are, the more likely an innovation is to spread—people  are more likely to imitate similar  than different models. The two most rapidly adopting countries in the World are the U.S. and Japan. While the U.S.  interestingly scores very low, Japan scores high.
Physical distance: The greater the distance between people, the less likely innovation is to spread.
Opinion leadership: The more opinion leaders are valued and respected,
        the more likely an  innovation is to spread. The style of opinion leadersmoderates this influence, however. In less  innovative countries, opinion leaders tend to be more conservative, i.e., to reflect the local norms  of resistance.

It should be noted  that innovation is not always an unqualifiedly good thing. Some innovations, such as infant formula  adopted in developing countries, may do more harm than good. Individuals may also become  dependent on the innovations. For example, travel agents who get used to booking online may be unable  to process manual reservations.
 Sometimes innovations are disadopted.  For example, many individuals disadopt  cellular phones if they find out that they don’t end up using them much.
BRANDS AND BRANDING
      An essential issue in product management  is branding. Different firms have different  policies on the branding on their products. While 3M puts its brand name on a great diversity of products, Proctor & Gamble,  on the opposite extreme, maintains a separate  brand name for each product. In general, the use of brand extensions should be evaluated on the basis of the  compatibility of various products—can the same brand name represent  different products without conflict or confusion? Coca Cola for many years resisted putting its coveted brand name on a diet  soft drink. In the old days,  available sweeteners such as saccharin added an undesirable aftertaste, implying a clear sacrifice in taste for the  reduction in calories. Thus, to avoid damaging  the brand name Coca Cola, Coke instead named its diet cola Tab. Only after NutraSweet was introduced was the brand  extension allowed. Research shows that  consumers are more receptive to brand extensions when (1) the company appears to have the expertise to make the product  [McDonald’s was not thought as credible  as a photo-finishing service], (2) the products are congruent (compatible), and (3) the brand extension is not seen as being  exploitative of a high quality brand name [e.g., one should not use a  premium brand name like Heineken to make a trivially easy product like  popcorn].
 In many markets,  brands of different strength compete against each other. At the top level are national or international brands.  A large investment has usually been put into extensive brand building—including  advertising, distribution and, if needed,  infrastructure support. Although some national brands are better regarded than others—e.g., Dell has a better reputation  than e-Machines—the national brands usually  sell at higher prices than to regional and store brands. Regional  brands, as the name suggests, are typically sold only in one area. In  some cases, regional distribution is all  that firms can initially accomplish with the investment capital and other  resources that they have. This means that advertising is usually done at the  regional level. This limits the advertising opportunities and thus the effect  of advertising. In some cases, regional  brands may eventually grow into national ones. For example, Snapple® was  a regional beverage. While a regional beverage, it
      became so successful that it was able to attract investments to  allow a national launch. In a similar manner, some brands often start in a  narrow niche—either nationally or regionally—and may eventually work their way  up to a more inclusive national brand. For  example, Mars was originally a small brand that focused on liquor filled  chocolate candy. Eventually, the firm was able to expand. Store, or private label brands are, as the name suggests, brands  that are owned by retail store chains or consortia thereof. (For example, Vons and Safeway have  the same corporate parent and both carry the “Select” brand). Typically, store  brands sell at lower prices than do  national brands. However, because the chains do not have the external brand building costs, the margins on the store brands  are often higher. Retailers have a great  deal of power because they control the placement of products within the store. Many place the store brand  right next to the national brand and place a sign highlighting the cost  savings on the store brand.
 Co-branding involves firms using two or  more brands together to maximize appeal to consumers. Some ice cream makers,  for example, use their own brand name in  addition to naming the brands of ingredients contained. Sometimes, this  strategy may help one brand at the expense of the other. It is widely believed,  for example, that the “Intel inside” messages, which Intel paid computer makers  to put on their products and packaging, reduced the value of the computer  makers’ brand names because the emphasis was now put on the Intel  component.
 Certain “peripheral”  characteristics of products may “signal” quality or other value to consumers. For some products, packaging accounts for a  large part of the total product  manufacturing cost. Long warranties often signal to consumers that the product is of good quality since the manufacturer  is willing to take responsibility for its functioning.
 THE PRODUCT-SERVICE CONTINUUM
      There is no clear distinction between a “pure” tangible  product and a service. Most products  contain some of both. A computer, for example, is a tangible product, but it often comes with a warranty and software updates.
