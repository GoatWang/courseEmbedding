Best use is as an office. This property is in the process of being renovated and totally cleaned up, painted inside and out, reception area floor redone, it will be nicely landscaped and front brick pavers to be cleaned. This property has great visability. It's on the corner of Hanley Rd and Jackson Springs Rd. I purchased and completely renovated this property to use as my office before the recession (newer 30 year dimensional roof and two a/c units, floors, doors, windows, walls, fixtures, brick paved parking lot, etc). The pictures are from when I had my office there. There is a tenant there now and the property could use some TLC. Mostly paint and minor things, but the property is still in very good condition. It has six offices and a huge conference room, 2.5 bathrooms, a break room/kitchen and a spacious reception area. The zoning is OR (office residential). You can live there and have your office there as well. It can be purchased with a residential loan, which should mean a lower interest rate for the buyer. It is on a very busy intersection and is very noticeable. Seller is a lic. real estate broker.
