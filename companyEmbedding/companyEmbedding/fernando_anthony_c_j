                                    Patents by Inventor C. J. Anthony Fernando
                                




                    C. J. Anthony Fernando has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







DISSOLUTION TESTING WITH INFRARED TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT



Publication number:  20110216805
                                            

Abstract:  A dissolution test apparatus may include a vessel support member, a sensor support member, infrared temperature sensors, and an electronic controller. The vessel support member may have apertures for receiving vessels. The infrared temperature sensors are mounted at the sensor support member. Each infrared temperature sensor is positioned proximate to a respective vessel mounting site to receive infrared radiation emitted by media contained in a vessel mounted at the vessel mounting site, and is configured to transmit a measurement signal indicative of the temperature of the media. The electronic controller communicates with the infrared temperature sensors and is configured to receive and process the measurement signals transmitted from the infrared temperature sensors. The electronic controller may be configured to control media temperature in the vessels.

Abstract:  A dissolution test apparatus includes a vessel support member, weight sensors, a movable component, a media transport cannula, a pump, and an electronic controller. The vessel support member receives vessels. A weight sensor is located at each vessel site. Each weight sensor contacts a vessel and transmits a measurement signal indicative of the weight of the vessel and any contents therein. The movable component moves the media transport cannula toward a vessel site. The pump establishes media flow between the media transport cannula and the selected vessel. The controller communicates with the weight sensors and may also communicate with the pump. Based on the measurement signals received from the weight sensors, the electronic controller may calculate the volume of media in a given vessel. The electronic controller may also control media flows to or from the vessels by transmitting control signals to the pump assembly.

Fiber optic probe and related apparatus, systems and methods for making optics-based measurements of liquid samples



Patent number:  7817277
                                            

Abstract:  A fiber-optic probe includes first and second optical fibers disposed in a body, a liquid sampling region between ends of the fibers and a reflector, and apertures communicating with the sampling region. The probe may be inserted in media in a vessel. Optical signals are transmitted through the first fiber, the sampling region and second fiber. The sampling region is offset from other parts of the probe so that bubbles or particulates flow out from the sampling region without being obstructed by the probe.

Apparatus and method for agitating a sample during in vitro testing



Patent number:  7407631
                                            

Abstract:  In an apparatus and method for agitating a sample during dissolution or other in vitro testing, a movable component is disposed in a container for reciprocating or rotating a sample carrier such as a dosage form or stent through a medium in the container. The apparatus can include a closure member to seal the container for substantially preventing loss of contents during movement of the sample carrier. The movable component can be actuated by a driving source in a non-contacting manner. The movable component can include a magnet drivable by a source external to the container. The container can include first and second container sections having different volumes, in which case actuation of the movable component causes agitation of the sample carrier through a medium contained in one of the container sections. The container can include a hole at or near the bottom for filling the container, using instruments, and the like.

Fiber-optic dissolution systems devices, and methods



Patent number:  7332128
                                            

Abstract:  A dissolution system provides remote flow cells integrated into a manifold device. The manifold device communicates with liquid input and output lines associated with each flow cell, as well as fiber-optic input and output lines associated with each flow cell. Liquid samples are respectively drawn from dissolution vessels, optically-related measurements are taken, and the samples are thereafter returned their respective vessels. The manifold device can be adapted to receive probe-type instruments that incorporate the fiber-optics, wherein each probe-type instrument is associated with each flow cell. Alternatively, each corresponding pair of fiber-optic input and output lines are disposed in opposing, optically-aligned relation and probe-type instruments are not used. The gap between the ends of the opposing fiber-optic lines provides a light path across the corresponding flow cell.

Dissolution test apparatus



Patent number:  6962674
                                            

Abstract:  A dissolution test apparatus comprises a spindle head assembly interconnected between first and second lateral support members. The lateral support members are translatable along a first axis, and the spindle head assembly is translatable along a second axis, such that the spindle head assembly is movable from a front, operative position at which test procedures are effected, to a rear position at which access to the dissolution test apparatus is enhanced. The spindle head assembly includes a dosage delivery mechanism including an actuatable dosage unit-retaining member. A front portion of the dissolution test apparatus has a tapered width to accommodate a triangular or trapezoidal array of test vessels, resulting in high visibility of the vessels.

Waterless vessel heating system and method



Patent number:  6727480
                                            

Abstract:  A dissolution testing system comprises a vessel plate on which a plurality of vessels are mounted. Each vessel includes a lateral wall having an outer surface around which a plurality of flexible heater elements are attached. Each heater element includes a transparent surface area, a heat conductive element extending along the transparent surface area, a temperature sensing element extending along the transparent surface area, and an electrical contact element connected to the heat conductive element and the temperature sensing element. The heater element can have more than one heating zone, with at least one of the heating zones being selectively energizable. The transparent heater element allows unobstructed view into the interior of its vessel, and reduces the time required to achieve a stabilized set point temperature in the vessel. A heater control system communicates with each heat conductive element and each temperature sensing element through a corresponding one of the electrical contact elements.

Vessel centering system and method



Patent number:  6673319
                                            

Abstract:  A vessel centering system comprises a vessel, an annular spacer member, a fastening element, and a first magnetic element. The vessel includes an outer surface and a vessel groove formed on a circumference of the vessel outer surface. The spacer member is fitted in the vessel groove and extends outwardly with respect to the vessel. The first and second lateral end surfaces define a spacing therebetween. The spacer member includes a tangential bore extending along a line generally tangential to a curvature of the spacer member. The fastening element, which could be a screw, is disposed in the tangential bore in engagement with the ring member and extends across the ring spacing. The first magnetic element is supported by or enclosed within the spacer member. A vessel plate with a vessel mounting aperture is structured to accommodate the mounting or installation of the vessel. A second magnetic element is supported by the vessel plate.
