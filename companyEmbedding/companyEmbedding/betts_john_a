THESE LESSONS PUT THE MAJOR AND MINOR LEAD CHORD PROGRESSIONS IN AN EASY TO REMEMBER FORMAT ESPECIALLY LINKING THE MAJOR PATTERNS THROUGH THE “MY GIRL” PATTERN. WHERE I COULD NOT GO ON THE FRETBOARD BEFORE, I NOW CAN FLY ACROSS THE FRETBOARD PICKING AND CHOOSING WHERE I WANT TO GO WITH LEAD IMPROVISATIONS AND ITS IMPRESSIVE FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH AND LISTEN. JOHN, YOU DID GOOD. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK…YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE Doug—S.C. – May 26, 2010Dickey BettsI really enjoy all aspects of the lessons. They are well done and easy to understand and follow along. I enjoy playing along with the backing tracks. All around pleasure and well worth the price. flitzefinger—Middle of Germany Göttingen – May 28, 2010now people say, sounds goodGreat Course, helped me a lot to play like I ever wanted to in this style , thank you very much John. warm regards Per H—Inglewood, CA – May 28, 2010Blues Guitar Method: Various solos; Dickey BettsYour instruction is right on, and easy to follow, which just leaves the physical aspect of the playing to me. I can honestly say that I have learned a lot, and I am still learning from your DVDs. So far with the lessons that I have covered, I feel pretty good about my blues playing. If you have any tips about “raking”, please pass them on,. TimH—Northern California – June 1, 2010Blue Sky DVD  Great lesson!! Learning a boat load of material. It is nice to play Major pentatonic like Dickey does. I have been learning minor pentatonic solo material and this is a nice break. I have busted out of the ordinary with this material. Well presented and John explains everything. The course include tab and backing track. Growth in imminent!! Tim Halleran snootermac—The Great MidWest – June 2, 2010Very Helpful and well made  This was a very helpful and well made product. I like all of John’s lessons! Jean-Mi—La Rochelle, FRANCE – June 3, 2010Good Job ManBravo John you make a “très bon travail”. I am an absolute fan of ABB (I was in NY in march at the United Palace, it was great Man). Bravo for Stormy Monday lesson. Great Solo. What about the Reed solo (fillmore version). It will be a good lesson for me. Thanks you John, with your good Job. Now “I feel more” with my guitar. Salut et à plus tard. Jean-Michel Fillifluran—Stockholm, Sweden – July 18, 2010The best for an amateurAs an music fan, ealier I didn´t have the time to learn playing the guitar, this DVD the lessons are very good. I enjoy every minute of it and I have made more progress than I thought would be possible. (Even my wife!!!) learnintheblues123—Bangalore, India – September 9, 2010Dickey Betts Blue Sky styleHey John thanks for the great lesson, although i found this DVD to be a little difficult the way you connected every lick to theory everything made sense and i can now improvise decently over a blue sky style major backing track after only a week of practice. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to add the major scale to their arsenal!! Im now hoping you make a DVD like this on Hendrix……. Monte—Dartmouth, MA – December 3, 2010Play Like Dickey Betts Blue Sky StyleAwesome lesson that was worth every cent. puttydust—Highland, Calif – December 5, 2010Play Like Dickey BettsI’ve found this Video quite good and easy to comprehend. In the past, I had never really used the mixolydian scale and this lesson has helped me in learning to play with this scale and the backing track is a perfect tool for practicing, the use of the mixolydian scale and developing lick of my own. Thanks.. Jonenew—Merrick, New York – December 11, 2010Great LessonsJohn..thanks for the great lessons! You’re easy teaching style blends superb technique with easily digestible theory, style and great practical tips. My jamming has exponentially changed for the better with the help of your lessons! JAB—PA – May 10, 2011Dickey Betts Blue Sky StyleLike all of John’s DVD’s, this one is excellent. Very thorough and not a “note for note” type lesson format. Rather, it focuses on technique and the approach Dickey Betts uses in his playing and John has a great teaching style that works for me. I have had great results. Highly recommended. Also, try his Blues Guitar method! mcblues—Southeastern, PA – September 28, 2011Becoming a More Tuneful PlayerJohn Tuggle has obviously taken loads of time to make this content-rich set of lessons. Do you want to learn Dickey Betts style licks? John takes you through them step by step. Do you want to learn Dickey Betts style solos? John, again, takes you through step by step. Do you want to learn the theory behind why Dickey Betts’ music sounds the way it does? John explains the theory and applies it to the fretboard – again, step by step so you can start making your own music in this genre. If you pay attention to John’s teaching, you will become a more tuneful, melodic and interesting guitar player. These lessons are worth every penny. I would absolutely buy them again – thanks John! Leif Bouffard—Mulberry, Florida – February 10, 2012So Far So GoodJohn, It’s early yet for a real rating. Made it thru the Natural Major’s and I know where my D’s are (Myxolidian). I should be able to figure out the Minors right? About half way through the Solo. Not as smooth as Forest yet, probably never will be. But I am learning and, having fun,that’s what it’s all about. Check back with me later. Leif Hank V—Maine – September 10, 2012Dickey BettsI’ve been an Allman Bros fan since the beginning and a guitar player even longer. Improvisation is their strength and this series of DVDs gets you there in a very logical straight forward fashion. It has allowed me to understand the fret board geography and the relation of major and minor scales as it relates to Dickey’s playing. Most importantly I can now be improvisational over all the tunes where as before I sounded like I was trying too hard to do a lame note for note replication. Best content I have found on this subject Mark—Germany – November 19, 2012Dickey BettsI just downloaded your Dickey Betts style lessons, and I would like to tell you that I\’m blown away by the quality of your stuff. I\’ve been a Strat/SRV/Hendrix-style player so far, and I was just looking for something that could broaden my musical horizon and that would allow me to expand my vocabulary as a musician, so I decided to download your Dickey Betts lessons.I was a bit reluctant at first, because the set has certainly its price, but I realized instantly that it was worth every cent I spent on it. The lessons are pretty fast-paced and a bit challenging, so I think that I\’ll be working on the Allman Brothers-stuff well into 2013…I think that your lessons are just what the doctor ordered, and I\’m pretty sure that I\’ll purchase your Clapton and BB King lessons very soon! Kind regards from Germany, Mark midrider335—Yonkers, NY – March 21, 2013Play Like Dickey BettsHi John,I have had your play like Dickey Betts course for several months now and would like to say thank you for a great course! It does a good job in showing Dickey’s soloing approach during the Duane era of the ABB. Bravo! I just ordered the “Play Like Warren Haynes” DVD course as he is my favorite current guitarist and am anxiously waiting for it!Hopefully one day you will put together a course on the playing style of Duane’s (my all-time favorite!) non-slide playing technique! Once again thank you for these great courses!keep on rockin’!, Ed Stephen – April 2, 2016Ive had this course for a couple of months now and have to say its by far one of the best purchases I have made. It has taken my playing to new heights. My knowledge of the fretboard and how to relate scales and chords musically has grown immensely. Now i find myself hitting notes and licks that I can relate to hearing in Dicky’s playing, something that I could never do before buying this course.
