Analytics "THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS" 





Analytics

				Use analytics to lead your successful digital transformation.
            





					Data analytics extracts insights  from large amounts of data and turns it into value.
					We at Hitachi can help you move through the digital  transformation of your business.
				





                        Digital transformation is essential for companies to continually enhance their corporate value. This shift combines analysis and simulation, reflecting real world scenarios in a digital context. The process dramatically accelerates the actualization of business ideas and is the foundation of continuous improvement.
                    

                        Data analytics create new value by extracting insights  from large amounts of data. Repeating these analytics in short cycles allows you to further accelerate the speed of your improvements and gain new abilities, ultimately leading to significant innovations.
                    

                        At Hitachi, we support digital transformation through long-term co-creation with our clients. It’s part of our commitment to you to solve your business problems and create new value.
                    





                    Our analytics are already accelerating the digital transformation of clients in many business fields.
                

                	Engineering work and expertise can now be automated and passed on to others through digitization and data analytics.
				





                        Engineering expertise plays a vital role in optimizing manufacturing work and formulating production plans. But because it is highly specialized, this knowledge has always been difficult to define and apply to wider, more efficient uses. Now, through the continuous analysis made possible by Hitachi analytics, your company is able to automate and digitize this expertise to use it in more areas of your business. For example, we helped a manufacturing company digitally reproduce 86%  of the work involved in formulating production plans that was previously done by proficient  engineers. As a result, they were able to raise quality and shorten development cycles in more areas of their business.   It’s just one of the many challenges Hitachi has taken on as we continue to find new opportunities in automation.
                    





                	Facilities and equipment serve as the foundation of many industries. You can implement effective prevention and maintenance measures by discovering early signs of failure through an analysis of operational data.
				





                        All businesses rely on the efficiency of their facilities and equipment. In order to operate at the highest efficiency, organizations must minimize the downtime caused by malfunctions and other factors. With analytics, we’re able to proactively predict failures by collecting and analyzing the data from these operational technologies. By implementing prevention and maintenance measures before mishaps occur, we can help make the best operational use of facilities, equipment and even whole businesses.
                    





					Damages from increasing numbers of security breaches can be minimized by time series analysis of a wide variety of data.
                





                        According to the report, Global State of Information Security , worldwide security incidents increased 38% in 2015 compared to the previous year. These breaches result in an astounding economic loss of hundreds of billion dollars per year. To help protect you from these catastrophic damages, our first step is to determine the causes of security threats. We do this with time series analysis through a comprehensive process that merges a variety of data from many different sources of information.
                    





                   Hitachi’s analytics are supported by diverse technologies and physical support
                

					Our Data Analytics Meister Service helps customers create innovation through a group of experts who possess both business knowledge and data analysis intelligence.
                

                    Big data is big business. Hitachi helps you use big data to grow in the new digital economy by starting with a deeper understanding of advanced analysis products and information and communications technology (ICT) products. But we don’t stop there. In addition to this innovative analytics approach, Hitachi also provides consulting through our Data Analytics Meister Service.
					Our Data Analytics Meister—a specialist in big data utilization—gives you a full walkthrough of the analytics process from start to finish. 
					This comprehensive service advances through four phases:
				

                   (1) Design a vision and set a goal.
				   (2) Formulate a utilization scenario, in which a scenario for realizing the vision is developed—clarifying the value that will be created.
				   (3) Verify the practical use in which the data analysis method is established and its efficacy is verified.
				   (4) Implement the system, to apply the final execution. Our team works closely with you to help you through every stage of the analytics process.




					Pentaho is an analytics solution that integrates operational data and big data, enabling you to analyze your business from all angles.
                

					Pentaho analytics integrates a wide variety of data—from internal and external data to the vast amount of data collected through the internet of things (IoT)—and makes it available on demand for analysis. This solution aggregates all of the data into a “data lake,” and quickly provides a simple-format summary. It also offers a 360 degree analysis that helps users in different parts of your organization to quickly make the best possible decisions from accurate information.
				




					“Hitachi AI Technology” investigates large volumes of data to uncover effective hypotheses.
                

					Through years of research, Hitachi has developed an artificial intelligence technology that is creating real value for our customers. By conducting analysis beyond the limits of human capabilities, Hitachi AI Technology helps you uncover hypotheses and unimaginable solutions.

About Us
Centaur is developing technology targeted to the quality and safety of stored crops and food/feed in storage. Centaur wireless sensors and data analytics enable predictive spoilage prevention, cognitive & prescriptive pest management. This technology is proven to eliminate insect-related risks in grains, tobacco and various other ag commodities at post-harvest stages, as well as in packaged products. Centaur's cloud-based solution provides traceability from farm to shelf, end-to-end quality management and pest-free certification with advanced digital means.
Centaur recently announced its signature cloud platform which addresses leading ag companies. The system intuitively fuses data from storage areas (e.g. silos, containers, warehouses), weather forecasts, as well as data streams from Centaur's own storage monitoring and fumigation control sensors. This brings unique and unprecedented benefits. End users can now predict spoilage events months before they occur, plan and implement precision fumigation and pest management and track stored product quality in real-time with customized alerts and notifications.
After leaving the field, 17% of the world’s ag products spoil from infestation, storage conditions and weather. It’s a loss that affects both developed and developing countries, and costs nearly $1 trillion annually. Using real-time data from sensors that move with each crop, Centaur gives the food industry an unprecedented capacity to track, monitor, and instantly adjust the conditions in which the world’s food is stored, preventing spoilage and reducing unnecessary chemical use. Centaur’s mission is to reduce post-harvest crop losses while increasing food traceability and global food security.

Centaur Inks Supply Deal with Detia Degesch, Global Leader in Stored Product Protection for Agricultural Commodities & Food Products
May 9, 2017



The partnership marks a major initiative by industry leader Detia Degesch, and AgTech innovator Centaur, to deliver cognitive, connected and precise fumigation solutions for better, safer products
VENTURA, CALIFORNIA AND LAUDENBACH, GERMANY  — May 8, 2017 —- Centaur Analytics, a leading AgTech IoT company developing sensors and software solutions that improve the quality and safety of agricultural products, announced today that it entered into a supply and collaboration agreement with Detia Degesch Group, a global leader in stored product protection solutions for commodities such as grains, wheat, rice, maize, soya, nuts, dried fruits, tea, coffee and tobacco as well as for processed food products. Under this agreement, Detia will promote and market Centaur’s integrated wireless sensors and IoT platform analytics using its global salesforce and will also use the Centaur solution throughout its own network of fumigation services. The joint offerings are slated for availability in Germany, United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and South Africa in the coming months.
“Both of our companies are deeply committed to reducing post-harvest risks and waste through advanced pest management solutions,” said Dr. Marco Rudolf, Managing Director of Detia Degesch. “There is an inherent synergy to this collaboration which will bring unprecedented benefits to all stakeholders in the agricultural product supply chain, from farm to fork. Detia Degesch has been protecting and treating the world’s crops and food supplies for over 175 years. The inclusion of Centaur’s solution within our portfolio underscores our commitment to protect the world’s harvested crops and food supplies with cutting edge technology, for decades to come”, concluded Dr. Rudolf.
This agreement comes at the conclusion of an extensive testing and field validation of Centaur’s Internet-of-Crops cognitive software and connected hardware technology, which has been aimed at substantially reducing post-harvest spoilage by providing precision phosphine fumigation monitoring methods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO) estimates annual agricultural crop waste at 30%, with over 10% loss occurring during post-harvest storage, transportation, and processing. 
“We are thrilled to have Detia Degesch, leader of post-harvest solutions, as a key partner in our mission to reduce the US$1 trillion in annual crop waste and food loss with our breakthrough technology”, commented Dr. Sotiris Bantas, President & CEO of Centaur Analytics. “Our joint customers in agriculture, food industry and pest management services should expect fumigation practices to change dramatically – to the better. Centaur’s newly launched wireless sensors and Internet-of-Crops cognitive data platform will bring monitoring of phosphine fumigation to unprecedented levels in terms of user-friendliness and reliability.” 
Vasilis Sotiroudas, a renowned stored product specialist and food scientist who is a Centaur cofounder and Chief Commercial Officer added: “This partnership is a major milestone in the life of our company. I am more than intimately familiar with the Detia Degesch brands which is a hallmark of quality and reliability in the industry, having used Detia products myself in the field for several years. We have been working closely with Detia Degesch to reinforce fumigation practices and rise up to global challenges such as insect tolerance. I am very confident that the technology Centaur brings and Detia endorses will be an innovative solution for several years to come. The response from fumigators and customers who are experiencing it is nothing short of enthusiastic.” 
Detia Degesch Group has been helping protect against, detect and treat the leading culprit of loss, pest infestations, with high quality fumigation products it distributes in over 120 countries. With the addition of Centaur’s signature Internet-of-Crops platform, end users in agriculture and food industry can now add the ability to monitor fumigations in real-time, while predicting and mitigating infestation and spoilage before they happen. The Centaur platform uniquely prescribes custom, targeted treatments that help keep the world’s harvested crops and processed food products safer, healthier and abundant. Centaur’s technology, based on its wireless sensors and cognitive insect mortality data analytics, streamlines the application of the fumigant of choice that Detia Degesch is well known for – phosphine.
Centaur recently announced its signature cloud platform for leading agriculture companies. The system intuitively fuses data from storage areas (e.g. silos, containers, warehouses), weather forecasts, as well as data streams from Centaur’s own storage monitoring and fumigation control sensors. This brings unique and unprecedented benefits. End users can now predict spoilage events months before they occur, plan and implement precision fumigation and pest management and track stored product quality in real-time with customized alerts and notifications. Registration is currently open to qualified users to participate in Centaur’s SaaS Beta Software. More information on qualifying for the 6-month trial is available here.

Analytics "THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS" 





Analytics

				Use analytics to lead your successful digital transformation.
            





					Data analytics extracts insights  from large amounts of data and turns it into value.
					We at Hitachi can help you move through the digital  transformation of your business.
				





                        Digital transformation is essential for companies to continually enhance their corporate value. This shift combines analysis and simulation, reflecting real world scenarios in a digital context. The process dramatically accelerates the actualization of business ideas and is the foundation of continuous improvement.
                    

                        Data analytics create new value by extracting insights  from large amounts of data. Repeating these analytics in short cycles allows you to further accelerate the speed of your improvements and gain new abilities, ultimately leading to significant innovations.
                    

                        At Hitachi, we support digital transformation through long-term co-creation with our clients. It’s part of our commitment to you to solve your business problems and create new value.
                    





                    Our analytics are already accelerating the digital transformation of clients in many business fields.
                

                	Engineering work and expertise can now be automated and passed on to others through digitization and data analytics.
				





                        Engineering expertise plays a vital role in optimizing manufacturing work and formulating production plans. But because it is highly specialized, this knowledge has always been difficult to define and apply to wider, more efficient uses. Now, through the continuous analysis made possible by Hitachi analytics, your company is able to automate and digitize this expertise to use it in more areas of your business. For example, we helped a manufacturing company digitally reproduce 86%  of the work involved in formulating production plans that was previously done by proficient  engineers. As a result, they were able to raise quality and shorten development cycles in more areas of their business.   It’s just one of the many challenges Hitachi has taken on as we continue to find new opportunities in automation.
                    





                	Facilities and equipment serve as the foundation of many industries. You can implement effective prevention and maintenance measures by discovering early signs of failure through an analysis of operational data.
				





                        All businesses rely on the efficiency of their facilities and equipment. In order to operate at the highest efficiency, organizations must minimize the downtime caused by malfunctions and other factors. With analytics, we’re able to proactively predict failures by collecting and analyzing the data from these operational technologies. By implementing prevention and maintenance measures before mishaps occur, we can help make the best operational use of facilities, equipment and even whole businesses.
                    





					Damages from increasing numbers of security breaches can be minimized by time series analysis of a wide variety of data.
                





                        According to the report, Global State of Information Security , worldwide security incidents increased 38% in 2015 compared to the previous year. These breaches result in an astounding economic loss of hundreds of billion dollars per year. To help protect you from these catastrophic damages, our first step is to determine the causes of security threats. We do this with time series analysis through a comprehensive process that merges a variety of data from many different sources of information.
                    





                   Hitachi’s analytics are supported by diverse technologies and physical support
                

					Our Data Analytics Meister Service helps customers create innovation through a group of experts who possess both business knowledge and data analysis intelligence.
                

                    Big data is big business. Hitachi helps you use big data to grow in the new digital economy by starting with a deeper understanding of advanced analysis products and information and communications technology (ICT) products. But we don’t stop there. In addition to this innovative analytics approach, Hitachi also provides consulting through our Data Analytics Meister Service.
					Our Data Analytics Meister—a specialist in big data utilization—gives you a full walkthrough of the analytics process from start to finish. 
					This comprehensive service advances through four phases:
				

                   (1) Design a vision and set a goal.
				   (2) Formulate a utilization scenario, in which a scenario for realizing the vision is developed—clarifying the value that will be created.
				   (3) Verify the practical use in which the data analysis method is established and its efficacy is verified.
				   (4) Implement the system, to apply the final execution. Our team works closely with you to help you through every stage of the analytics process.




					Pentaho is an analytics solution that integrates operational data and big data, enabling you to analyze your business from all angles.
                

					Pentaho analytics integrates a wide variety of data—from internal and external data to the vast amount of data collected through the internet of things (IoT)—and makes it available on demand for analysis. This solution aggregates all of the data into a “data lake,” and quickly provides a simple-format summary. It also offers a 360 degree analysis that helps users in different parts of your organization to quickly make the best possible decisions from accurate information.
				




					“Hitachi AI Technology” investigates large volumes of data to uncover effective hypotheses.
                

					Through years of research, Hitachi has developed an artificial intelligence technology that is creating real value for our customers. By conducting analysis beyond the limits of human capabilities, Hitachi AI Technology helps you uncover hypotheses and unimaginable solutions.
