            			Tickets & Attractions is a dynamic and flexible product that allows you to tap into the lucrative market for travelers who wish to book activities, shows and transfers before they leave on their trip.  








COMPREHENSIVE CHOICES FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS



With Tickets & Attractions, your earning potential is greatly increased, since the product offers over 1400 products in 150 destinations, including the US, Canada, Caribbean and Europe. Tickets & Attractions is also a strong standalone product -- it enables you to sell the most popular activities, shows, and rides in these 150 destinations. The product is private-branded throughout the booking experience (including credit card billing) and is available to all of your customers worldwide. Product categories include:
			


Attractions  – - theme parks (including Walt Disney World parks), popular attractions, museums, and galleries

Shows and events   – - theatre, musicals, concerts and comedy shows

Tours and activities  – - sightseeing, spa trips, shopping, cruises and water activities

FLEXIBLE AND USER-FRIENDLY



 The customer-friendly Tickets & Attractions pages give your visitors great flexibility in searching for tickets and activities. On the product's "front door" page, a search box allows searching by destination and dates. Customers can search all activities at once or by category. Up to 8 tickets per booking may be ordered, and names other than the purchaser may be designated for picking up tickets. Upon booking, customers receive a white-label voucher to exchange for their tickets.


WCT helps you sell Tickets & Attractions -- the product is featured in WCT's multi-product search box and links to the product appear on pages throughout the hotel booking process. WCT partners can build their own links, accompanied by eye-catching graphics available in our Partner Support Center. Tickets & Attractions may also be booked in multiple currencies (Dynamic Currency Conversion or DCC). 







INCREASED EARNINGS WITH TICKETS & ATTRACTIONS



Online ticket purchases made through our Tickets & Attractions booking engine pay you 40% of the collected commission. Commissions are paid to you on a monthly basis after the tickets have been used or consumed, with reporting posted daily in our Partner Support Center. Tickets are sold as non-refundable and may not be cancelled.

                Ordered tickets to a concert, good seats, expensive tickets (more than they would have been if you could have purchased from the venue). Tickets never came. I was told they were delivered, regular delivery put in your mail box, no signature, no proof of delivery. Called STub Hub they were not helpful. I was told the seller could not have the tickets reprinted. I was suspicious, why would a venue not reprint tickets? Perhaps they were not obtained in a way that the venue wants to support. So no…

If your tickets were for "general admission", no venue will reprint them.  On the other hand, if they were for a specific seat in a specific block they should be easily reprinted.

                I bought tickets to a Garth Brooks show in Louisville. He announced a show in Columbus Ohio after that. Columbus is closer so I listed the tickets for sale for the Louisville show. At a loss mind you. I sold them. New buyer refused sale when the ticket time on the printed tickets was for a 10:00 pm show not the 7:00 pm show I thought I had purchased and listed. Guess what, when I went back and tried to print my clearly listed 7:00 pm show tickets it too says 10:00 pm when I print them. 45…

                Purchased tickets to be mailed to us.  they were stolen.  Was told it isn't stub hubs fault (even tho they don't require a signature upon delivery).  Was told they could try to reprint tickets but if the people who stole the tickets showed up they would get to stay in our seats!??  But hey its ok, because if we call stub hub at the event they would try to get us other comparable seats.  I said what if there were no comparable seats-sorry not our problem.  Not worth the risk!! If you cannot…

                Purchased tickets through this site as I thought could get a better deal. Was charged $118.00 over price, I could have bought tickets through the Ringling site. Will NEVER use this site again, they should be arrested for this criminal act…

                My wife and I bought pit tickets for a concert that was an 8 hour drive away.  We made the mistake of thinking that this was a reputable site that had actual tickets posted. Of course we traveled the 8 hours and stayed in a hotel.  When we went to the concert, security scanned the tickets and they were marked as "refunded".  We were denied entry into the concert! Security team there stated that they have seen this happen multiple times from StubHub where sellers would sell their tickets through…

                First of all, I didn't know that this was a Fan to Fan site.  I ordered parking lot tickets for an upcoming event (Arkansas Razorbacks VS Texas AM).  There were several variation of spaces available; however, in my case, I purchased parking lot spaces for $124.99.  There were several available below this price all the way down to $23.  Well I just noticed that they used the old "bait and switch" on me.  I received parking lot tickets with a $45.00 price out in BFE.....  When I called Stubhub…

                I ordered bama vs Wisconsin, in Arlington, 8 months ahead. Got within a month of leaving, called the owner personally, to check that we would have tickets in hand before flying out. Ticket were delivered a week before expected delivery date.  A perfect, flawless, transaction. Thank you for a great experience…

                Loved StubHub before. Now the new interface sucks!!! You can not see all the tickets in the sections or seat numbers. If you have tickets for sale can not see relationship to others. I am a season ticket holder for Baltimore Orioles and liked the convenience of using StubHub to buy and sell tickets. May have rethink season tickets for next year!!…

                You MUST read to the end of this story.  I can never repay StubHub for their generosity.  I cannot believe what StubHub did for my me and my boyfriend at the 2015 Super Bowl in Arizona.  I had purchased tickets through another online seller, just to find out that the supplier never delivered the tickets to the broker.  In other words, our tickets were gone.  We spent thousands to travel to Arizona for nothing.  I see some people on here complaining about their tickets not being available, but I…

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
