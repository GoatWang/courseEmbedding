2016 Annual Report










Stock QuoteNYSENYCBMarket Value ($M)6,244.83Change ($)(0.55)Change (%)(4.13)Volume7,636,868Stock Quote ($)12.77As of July 26, 2017 - Minimum 20 minute delay.New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: NYCB) is one of the 25 largest bank holding 
companies in the nation, with assets of $48.3 billion and a market cap of $6.4 
billion at June 30, 2017. With deposits of $28.9 billion and 255 branches in Metro New York, 
New Jersey, Florida, Arizona, and Ohio, we also rank among the largest depositories 
in the United States. 

We operate our branches through two banks with eight local divisions, reflecting 
our growth through seven traditional mergers and two FDIC-assisted transactions 
between the years 2000 and 2010. Established in 1859, New York Community Bank is 
a New York State-chartered savings bank with 225 branches throughout our five-state 
franchise; established in 2005 and also New York State-chartered, New York Commercial 
Bank has 30 branches--all in Metro New York. 

In addition to fueling the growth of our deposit franchise, acquisitions have fueled 
the growth of our interest-earning assets and, in particular, our multi-family loans. 
We are a leading producer of multi-family loans for portfolio in New York City, 
with an emphasis on rent-regulated buildings that feature below-market rents. At 
the end of June, our portfolio totaled $26.9 billion, representing 72.1% of total 
held-for-investment loans. 

In addition to our expertise in multi-family lending, we are known for our record of superior asset quality. Over the course of our public life, few of our non-performing assets resulted in actual losses, with net charge-offs representing a modest 0.04% of average loans during that time.

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. Announces Strategic Sale Of Mortgage Banking Business And Residential Assets Covered Under FDIC Loss Share Agreement






Business Wire




Jun 27, 2017 9:19 AM EDT













 


















































  New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: NYCB) (the "Company" or "New York Community") today announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its mortgage banking business, which was acquired as part of its 2009 FDIC-assisted acquisition of AmTrust Bank, to residential mortgage industry leader, Freedom Mortgage Corporation ("Freedom"). Freedom will acquire both our origination and servicing platforms, as well as our mortgage servicing rights portfolio with a current aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $21.0 billion. It is expected that Freedom will retain certain employees from the Company's Cleveland, Ohio mortgage banking business and plans to maintain operations in the area.  Additionally, the Company has received approval from the FDIC to sell the assets covered under our Loss Share Agreements (the "LSA") and we have entered into an agreement to sell the majority of our one-to-four family residential mortgage-related assets, including those covered under the LSA, to an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. ("Cerberus"), one of the world's leading private investment firms. On the sale, the head of Residential Mortgage Investing and a Senior Managing Director of Cerberus, Joshua Weintraub stated, "Cerberus is pleased to announce the consummation of this transaction with New York Community. This deal demonstrates the market leading ability of Cerberus, along with its affiliated asset management company, FirstKey Mortgage, LLC, to partner with financial institutions to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes for certain mortgage assets." As of March 31, 2017, the carrying value of these assets was approximately $1.9 billion.  The transactions are expected to close during the third quarter of 2017, subject to certain closing conditions, and, on a combined basis, result in a gain on sale of approximately $90.0 million on a pre-tax basis.  Commenting on the sale, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph R. Ficalora stated, "The decision to sell the mortgage banking business comes after many months of careful evaluation with our Board of Directors and our outside advisors. Selling to a large, national, full-service mortgage banking company that would keep certain employees and maintain operations in the region were important considerations during the evaluation process. Our presence in Ohio is an important component of our business strategy, and following the sale of the mortgage banking business, we will continue to have 28 branches, $2.0 billion in deposits, and more than 400 employees in Ohio."
