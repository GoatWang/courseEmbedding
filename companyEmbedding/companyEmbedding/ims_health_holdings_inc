FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Business model[edit]
IMS Health is best known for its collection of healthcare information spanning sales, de-identified prescription data, medical claims, electronic medical records[9] and social media.[10] IMS Health’s products and services are used by companies to develop commercialization plans[11] and portfolio strategies,[12] to select patient and physician populations for specific therapies, and to measure the effectiveness of pharmaceutical marketing and sales resources.[13] The firm uses its own data to produce syndicated reports such as market forecasts and market intelligence.
History and acquisitions[edit]
The original name of the company was Intercontinental Marketing Statistics, hence the IMS name. IMS Health's corporate headquarters is located in Danbury, Connecticut, United States. The company's chairman and CEO is Ari Bousbib.

In 2002, IMS Health acquired Cambridge Pharma Consultancy, a privately held international firm that provides strategic advice to pharmaceutical management.
In 2003, acquired Marketing Initiatives, a specialist in healthcare facility profile data, and Data Niche Associates, a provider of rebate validation services for Medicaid and managed care.
In 2004, United Research China Shanghai was acquired, providing coverage of China’s consumer health market.
In 2005, acquired PharMetrics, a U.S. provider of patient-centric integrated claims data.
In 2006, acquired the Life Sciences practice of Strategic Decisions Group, a portfolio strategy consultant to the life sciences industry.
In 2007, IMS Health acquired IHS and MedInitiatives, providers of healthcare data management analytics and technology services. That same year, ValueMedics Research was acquired, extending IMS Health’s health economics and outcomes research capabilities.
In 2007, ranked in the Businessweek 50. This list represents "best in class" companies from the ten economic sectors that make up the S&P 500.[14]
In 2008, named to the World’s Most Admired Companies list by Fortune. The company received the recognition again in 2010.
In 2008, acquired RMBC, a provider of national pharmaceutical market intelligence and analytics in Russia.
In 2008, acquired the Skura professional services group, based out of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada and specialized in data integration, consulting and services in business intelligence platforms to pharmaceutical and healthcare clients in North America and Europe.
In 2009, named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of the company’s economic, environmental and social performance among the largest 600 North American companies.
In February 2010, IMS Health was taken private by TPG Capital, CPP Investment Board, and Leonard Green & Partners.[15]
In 2010, acquired Brogan, Inc., a privately held market research and consulting firm serving the Canada healthcare market.
In 2011, expanded its specialty and patient-level data assets in the United States with the acquisition of SDI Health. Also that year, the company acquired Ardentia Ltd in the UK, and Med-Vantage in the United States to build on its payer services in those markets.
In 2012, acquired PharmARC Analytic Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a Bangalore-based analytics company.
In 2012, acquired DecisionView, a software solutions company that helps life sciences organizations plan and track patient enrollment for clinical trials[16] and TTC,[17] a benchmarking solutions and analytics company that helps clients plan for and negotiate the costs of clinical trials. Also in 2012, the company purchased PharmaDeals Ltd.,[18] a provider of online information about business transactions, licensing, and mergers and acquisitions activity within the pharmaceutical industry.
In 2013, acquired several companies to expand its portfolio of SaaS products: Incential Software, a provider of sales performance management technology services; 360 Vantage, which delivers multi-channel CRM software capabilities; Appature, which offers a relationship marketing platform; and Semantelli, a provider of social media analytics for the global healthcare industry.
In May 2015, IMS increased its software development capability by acquiring Dataline Software Ltd, a bespoke software development company and big data research specialist in the UK.[19]
In April 2015, IMS Health completed the purchase of Cegedim's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software and Strategic Data business for €396 million. Cegedim acquired the software and related business when it purchased Dendrite International in 2007.[20][21][better source needed]
In May 2016, the company announced it would merge with Quintiles in an approximate $9 billion deal,[22] in the process creating a new entity called Quintiles IMS. Combined 2015 revenue for the two companies would exceed $7.2 billion and the combined entity is estimated to have a market capitalisation in excess of $17.6 billion.[23] IMS Health shareholders will receive 0.384 shares of Quintiles common stock for each share of IMS Health common stock they hold, leaving the split of ownership at 51.4% IMS and 48.6% Quintiles.[24][25] The merger will create one of the largest providers of healthcare data, technology, and services solutions in the world, and is scheduled to close by the second half of 2016.[26]
In Dec 2016, acquired Q2 Metrics Inc a business intelligence company in the healthcare sector.

Controversy[edit]

Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. was a case about physician-data privacy, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court., the High Court ruled in favor of the company.[31][32][33][34]

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does).

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of 
52,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $988 
million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering to fund
the redemption of the 12.5% Senior Notes and Senior PIK Notes. We will also use
the U.S. dollar equivalent of $500.0 million of borrowings under the New Term
Loans, $148 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
approximately $400 million of cash on our balance sheet to (i) fund the
redemption of the 12.5% Senior Notes and Senior PIK Notes and pay related fees
and expenses, (ii) pay an estimated amount of $28 million in the aggregate to
holders of outstanding Phantom SARs, (iii) pay a one-time fee to terminate our
management services agreement with the Sponsors of $72 million and (iv) pay fees
and expenses related to financings.

Healthcare Technology Intermediate, Inc. is required to pay interest entirely in
cash at a rate of 7.375% per annum on the Senior PIK Notes, unless certain
conditions are satisfied, in which case it is entitled to pay interest on the
Senior PIK Notes by increasing the principal amount of such notes or by issuing
new notes (the issuance or interest, referred to herein as the “PIK Interest”).
PIK Interest on the Senior PIK Notes accrues at a rate of 8.125% per annum
(which is equal to the cash interest rate plus 75 basis points). The Senior PIK
Notes mature on September 1, 2018. The Senior PIK Notes were issued on August 6,
2013, and the proceeds of the Senior PIK Notes were used to pay a cash dividend
of $753 million on the outstanding shares of our common stock and to pay related
fees and expenses.

The 12.5% Senior Notes accrue cash interest at the rate of 12.5% per year and
IMS Health is required to pay interest entirely in cash. The 12.5% Senior Notes
mature on March 1, 2018.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders, including if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares. After deducting the underwriting discounts, the selling
stockholders will receive approximately $248 million of proceeds from this
offering.

Dividends declared in the year preceding an initial public offering are deemed
to be in contemplation of the offering with the intention of repayment out of
the offering proceeds to the extent that dividends exceeded earnings during such
period. We have provided pro forma earnings per share information for 2013 that
gives pro forma effect to the assumed issuance of a number of shares whose
proceeds are deemed to be necessary to pay previous year’s dividends in excess
of 2013 earnings ($671 million), as well as adjustments to give pro forma effect
to the Refinancing and settlement of Phantom SARs.

Certain affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., an underwriter of this offering,
hold a portion of our 12.5% Senior Notes, and it is expected that as a result of
the Refinancing, they will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of the
offering. In addition, affiliates of TPG Capital BD, LLC, an underwriter of this
offering, own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock.

As a result of the foregoing relationships, each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and TPG
Capital BD, LLC is deemed to have a “conflict of interest” within the meaning of
FINRA Rule 5121, and this offering will be conducted in accordance with such
rule. FINRA Rule 5121 requires that neither Goldman, Sachs & Co. nor TPG Capital
BD, LLC make sales to discretionary accounts without the prior written approval
of the account holder and that a qualified independent underwriter (“QIU”), as
defined in FINRA Rule 5121, participate in the preparation of the registration
statement of which this prospectus forms a part and exercise its usual standards
of due diligence with respect thereto. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has agreed to
act as QIU for this offering. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will not receive any
additional fees for serving as QIU in connection with this offering. We have
agreed to indemnify J.P. Morgan Securities LLC against certain liabilities
incurred in connection with acting as QIU, including liabilities under the
Securities Act or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required
to make in that respect.


We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. While we believe no 
competitor provides the combination of geographical reach and breadth of our 
services, we generally compete in the countries in which we operate with other 
information, analytics, technology, services and consulting companies, as well 
as with the in-house capabilities of our clients. Also, we compete with certain 
government agencies, private payers and other healthcare stakeholders that 
provide their data directly to others. In addition to country-by-country 
competition, we have a number of regional and global competitors in the 
marketplace as well. Our offerings compete with various firms, including 
Accenture, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Covance, Deloitte, Evidera, GfK, 
Health Market Science, IBM, Infosys, inVentiv Health, Kantar Health, McKinsey,
Nielsen, OptumInsight, Parexel, Press Ganey, Quintiles, RTI Health Solutions, 
Symphony Health Solutions, Synovate Healthcare, The Advisory Board, Trizetto, 
Verisk and ZS Associates. We also compete with a broad range of new entrants 
and start-ups that are looking to bring new technologies and business models to 
healthcare information services and technology services.


Company Description
We are a leading global information and technology services company providing
clients in the healthcare industry with comprehensive solutions to measure and
improve their performance. We have one of the largest and most comprehensive
collections of healthcare information in the world, spanning


 sales, prescription
and promotional data, medical claims, electronic medical records and social
media. Our scaled and growing data set contains over 10 petabytes of unique data
and over 500 million comprehensive, longitudinal, anonymous patient records
(i.e., records that are linked over time for each anonymous individual across
healthcare settings). Based on this data, we deliver information and insights on
approximately 90% of the world’s pharmaceuticals, as measured by sales revenue.
We standardize, organize, structure and integrate this data by applying our
sophisticated analytics and leveraging our global technology infrastructure to
help our clients run their organizations more efficiently and make better
decisions to improve their operational and financial performance. We have a
presence in over 100 countries, including high growth emerging markets, and we
generated 63% of our $2.54 billion of 2013 revenue from outside the United
States.

We serve key healthcare organizations and decision makers around the world,
spanning the breadth of life science companies, including pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, consumer health and medical device manufacturers, as well as
distributors, providers, payers, government agencies, policymakers, researchers
and the financial community. The breadth of the intelligent, actionable
information we provide is not comprehensively available from any other source
and would be difficult and costly for another party to replicate. Our
information and technology services offerings, which we have developed with
significant investment over our 60-year history, are deeply integrated into our
clients’ workflow. We maintain long-standing relationships and high renewal
rates with our clients due to the value of the services and solutions we
provide. The average length of our relationships with our top 25 clients, as
measured by 2013 revenue, is over 25 years and our retention rate for our top
1,000 clients from 2012 to 2013 was approximately 99%. We have significant
visibility into our financial performance, as historically about 70% of our
revenue has recurred annually, principally because our information and
technology services offerings are critical to our clients’ daily decision-making
and are sold primarily through subscription and service contracts.

We leverage our proprietary information assets to develop technology and
services capabilities with a talented healthcare-focused workforce that enables
us to grow our relationships with healthcare stakeholders. This set of
capabilities includes:

. A leading healthcare-specific global information technology (“IT”)            
  infrastructure, which we use to process data from over 45 billion healthcare  
  transactions annually and to collect data from over 780,000 fragmented feeds  
  globally, which we organize in a consistent and highly structured fashion     
  using proprietary methodologies;

. A staff of approximately 9,500 professionals across the globe, including over 
  1,200 experts in areas such as biostatistics, data science, bioinformatics,   
  healthcare economics, outcomes research, epidemiology, pharmacology and key   
  therapeutic areas;

. Our intelligent cloud, IMS One, which opens our sophisticated global IT       
  infrastructure to our clients and provides the ability to perform business    
  analytics in the cloud with large amounts of complex data. Our cloud is unique
  in the healthcare industry because it pre-integrates applications with IMS    
  data, eliminating the cost traditionally associated with integrating          
  information, and provides interoperability across both IMS and third party    
  applications, reducing the complexity traditionally associated with siloed    
  data; and

. A growing set of proprietary applications, which include: commercial          
  applications supporting sales operations, sales management, multi-channel     
  marketing and performance management; real-world evidence solutions helping   
  manufacturers and payers evaluate the value of treatments in terms of cost,   
  quality and outcomes; payer-provider solutions helping these constituents     
  optimize contracting and performance management; and clinical solutions       
  helping manufacturers and Clinical Research Organizations (“CROs”) better     
  design, plan, execute and track clinical trials.

At a time when the healthcare industry is experiencing transformational change
driven by global expansion and the growth of new categories of medicines,
intense cost pressures, a changing regulatory environment, and new payment and
delivery models, we enable our clients to gain and apply insights designed to
substantially improve operating performance. Our solutions, which are designed
to provide our clients access to our deep healthcare-specific subject matter
expertise, take various forms, including information, tailored analytics,
subscription software and expert services.

We believe our mission-critical relationships with our life science clients are
reflected in the role we play within four important areas of decision-making
related to their product portfolios: Research and Development, Pre-Launch,
Launch and In-Market. Over the last three years, we have introduced software and
services applications that have further deepened our level of client integration
by enabling our clients to enhance and automate many of these key
decision-making processes.
