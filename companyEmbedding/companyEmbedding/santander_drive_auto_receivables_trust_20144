Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Each of the Owner Trustee and the Administrator,
as applicable, is hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing
activities on behalf of the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor any
Person acting on behalf of the Issuer shall engage in any activity
other than in connection with the foregoing or other than as
required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the
Owner Trustee. The Seller hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as
trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have all
the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . As of the date of the Original
Trust Agreement, the Seller sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed
and set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of $1. The Owner Trustee
hereby acknowledges receipt in trust from the Seller, as of such
date, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute the
initial Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the Collection
Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of
Trust. The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject
to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Statute and
that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto that,
solely for federal income or state and local income, franchise and
value added tax purposes, so long as there is a single beneficial
owner of the Certificates, the Issuer will be disregarded as an
entity separate from such beneficial owner and the Notes will be
characterized as debt. The parties agree that, unless otherwise
required by appropriate tax authorities, the Issuer will not file
or cause to be filed annual or other necessary returns, reports and
other forms consistent with the characterization of the Issuer as
an entity separate from its owner. In the event that the Issuer is
deemed to have more than one beneficial owner for federal income
tax purposes, the Issuer will file returns, reports and other forms
consistent with the characterization of the Issuer as a partnership
(that is not treated as a publicly traded partnership), and this
Agreement may be amended to include such provisions as may be
required under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee
shall have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to
the extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust
Statute with respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that except as expressly
stated herein, the affairs of the Trust shall be managed by the
Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Owner
Trustee has heretofore filed the Certificate of Trust with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by
Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust Statute, such filing
hereby being ratified and approved in all respects. Notwithstanding
anything herein or in the Statutory Trust Statute to the contrary,
it is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a “business trust” within the meaning of
Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy Code.

legality, validity or enforceability of any of such agreements and
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and
adversely affect the transactions contemplated by, or the
Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under, the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the

obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(ii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not

obligation of the Seller enforceable
against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other
similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and, if
applicable the rights of creditors of limited liability companies

Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this

Seller’s knowledge, as of the date of hereof, no amounts are
required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to FATCA with respect
to payments to be made to the Certificateholders hereunder or under
the Sale and Servicing Agreement. If the Seller has actual
knowledge that withholding tax under FATCA applies with respect to
one or more payments on a Certificate, the Seller will notify the
Owner Trustee and the Certificate Paying Agent of such
fact.

understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and

Certificateholder’s tax returns inconsistent with
Section 2.6 herein and Section 2.14 of the
Indenture.

ARTICLE III

CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER OF
CERTIFICATES

SECTION 3.1. Initial
Ownership. Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the
issuance of the Certificates, the Seller shall be the sole
beneficiary of the Issuer, and upon the issuance of the
Certificate, the Seller will no longer be a beneficiary of the
Issuer, except to the extent that the Seller is a
Certificateholder.

SECTION 3.2. Authorization of the
Certificates. Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred
Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Owner Trustee, at the direction of the Seller, shall cause
(a) a single Book-Entry Certificate to be executed on behalf
of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered in the name of
Cede & Co. or (b) a single Definitive Certificate to
be executed on behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to
or upon the written order of the Seller. The Certificate shall
represent 100% of the Percentage Interest in the Issuer and shall
be fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3. Book-Entry
Certificates.

(a) Each of the Certificates, upon
original issuance, may be issued in the form of one or more
typewritten Certificates, substantially in the form of Exhibit
A hereto, representing the Certificates, to be delivered to the
Owner Trustee, as agent for the Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf
of, the Issuer. The Book-Entry Certificates shall be issued in an
aggregate nominal principal amount of $100,000 (which shall be
deemed to be the equivalent of 100,000 units), and all beneficial
interests in the Book-Entry Certificates shall be owned, in the
minimum principal amount of $5,000 and integral multiples of $1 in
excess thereof. The Issuer shall not issue any Certificate that
would cause the aggregate nominal principal amount of all
Certificates to exceed $100,000, or 100,000 units, without the
prior written consent of all Certificateholders. No distributions
of moneys to the Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents
shall be deemed to reduce the nominal principal amount of any
Certificate prior to payment in full of all Notes; provided,
however, that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to the
Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents upon final
distribution of the Trust Estate and termination of the Issuer
pursuant to Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall be deemed to
repay the aggregate nominal principal amount of the Certificates in
full; provided, further, that any failure to pay in full the
nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final
distribution date shall not result in any recourse to, claim
against or liability of any Person for such shortfall. Any amounts
payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Transaction Documents shall be paid and
allocated to the various Certificateholders ratably based on their
respective Percentage Interests. Unless the Seller directs
otherwise pursuant to Section 3.2 , such Certificates
shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the
name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC as the
initial

applicable Certificateholders pursuant to Section 3.2
or 3.5 :

(i) the provisions of this Section
shall be in full force and effect;

Certificate Paying Agent and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Agreement

Documents and the giving of instructions or directions hereunder)
as the sole Certificateholders, and shall have no obligation to the
Certificate Owners;

(iii) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions of
this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

(iv) the rights of Certificate
Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and
shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between
or among such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the

Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless
and until Definitive Certificates are issued pursuant to
Section 3.5 , the initial Clearing Agency will make
book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and
receive and transmit payments due under the Transaction Documents
with regard to the Certificates to such Clearing Agency
Participants;

(v) whenever this Agreement requires
or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of Certificateholders evidencing a specified percentage
of the Percentage Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver
instructions to the Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has
received instructions to such effect from Certificate Owners and/or
Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through Clearing
Agency Participants owning or representing, respectively, such
required percentage of the beneficial interest in the
Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial interest
in a Book-Entry Certificate will not be entitled to have any
portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their names and
will not be considered to be the Certificate Owners or
Certificateholders of any Certificates under this Agreement;
and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry
Certificate will be made to the Clearing Agency, or its nominee, as
the registered owner thereof, and none

the Certificate Paying Agent will have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Book-Entry
Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to the beneficial ownership interests.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Certificate remains
outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Clearing Agency,

Certificate is exchanged for one or more Definitive Certificates
pursuant to Section 3.5 , such Certificates may be
exchanged for one another only in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time
adopted by the Issuer and the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 3.4. Notices to Clearing
Agency. Whenever a notice or other communication to the
Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to Certificate
Owners pursuant to Section 3.5 , the Owner Trustee
shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to
be given to the Certificateholders to the Clearing Agency, and
shall have no obligation to the Certificate Owners.

SECTION 3.5. Definitive
Certificates.

(a) If (i) the Seller advises
the Owner Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer
willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with
respect to the Certificates, and the Seller is unable to locate a
qualified successor or (ii) the Seller at its option advises
the Owner Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency, then the Clearing
Agency shall notify all Certificate Owners and the Owner Trustee of
the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
Definitive Certificates representing the Certificates to
Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Owner
Trustee of the typewritten Certificate or Certificates representing
the Book-Entry Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by
re-registration instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the
Owner Trustee shall authenticate the Definitive Certificates
representing the Certificates in accordance with the instructions
of the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer, Certificate Registrar
or the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of
such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of
Definitive Certificates representing the Certificates, the Owner
Trustee shall recognize such Holders of the Definitive Certificates
as the applicable Certificateholders.

(b) Subject to the transfer
restrictions contained herein and in the Certificates, any Holder
of a Definitive Certificate may transfer all or any portion of the
Percentage Interest (subject to the requirements set forth in
Sections 3.3 and 3.7 ) evidenced by such Certificate
upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied by the
documents required by this Section 3.5 . Such transfer
may be made by a registered Certificateholder in person or by his
attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the
Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written
instrument of transfer in the form of the “Assignment”
attached to the Form of Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A
and with such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the
Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require, (b) an executed direction letter regarding
registration of such transfer in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C, (c) unless the transferee is a U.S. Affiliate of
the Seller, an executed Certificate Investor Representation Letter
in the form of Exhibit B (unless the Seller shall have received an
opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that
such transfer without an executed Certificate Investor
Representation Letter in the form of Exhibit B will not
cause the Issuer to be treated as an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and the Seller shall consent in writing that no such
written representation letter is required) and (d) the
documents required by Section 3.7(c) hereof. Promptly
upon the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee
of the transferor’s Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall
record the name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its
Percentage Interest in the Certificate Register and issue, execute
and deliver to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such
Percentage Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a
portion of its Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall
register and issue to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing
such transferor’s new Percentage Interest and shall issue,
execute and deliver to such transferee a new Certificate evidencing
such transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each
transfer of a beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the new
Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and
destroy in accordance with its customary practices the Certificate
surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. The Owner
Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever (other than to the
extent provided in Section 3.7 ), the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate.

Definitive Certificates will not be
eligible for clearing or settlement through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream.

SECTION 3.6. Registration of the
Certificates . The Owner Trustee, as an agent of the Issuer, in
its capacity as “Certificate Registrar” (the “

referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the
Certificateholders at the time of such appointment, a register (the
“ Certificate Register ”) for the registration
and transfer of any Certificate. Prior to the due presentment for
registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee and
the Certificate Registrar or any agent of the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered (as of the applicable Record Date) as the
owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions on such Certificate and for all other purposes
whatsoever.

SECTION 3.7. Transfer of the
Certificates .

(a) A Certificateholder may assign,
convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and
interest in the related Certificate, subject to the restrictions
set forth in Section 3.5 and this
Section 3.7 . Each purchaser and transferee (other than
a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller) of a Certificate will be required
to provide a Certificate Investor Representation Letter in the form
of Exhibit B to the Owner Trustee upon which it may
conclusively rely (unless the Seller shall have received an opinion
of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that such
transfer without an executed Certificate Investor Representation
Letter in the form of Exhibit B will not cause the Issuer to
be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the
Seller shall consent in writing that no such written representation
letter is required).

By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder thereof shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not, and is not
purchasing the Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with any assets of, a Benefit Plan or any governmental,
non-U.S., church or any other employee benefit plan or retirement
arrangement that is subject to Similar Law. Subject to the transfer
restrictions contained herein and in the Certificate, each
Certificateholder may transfer all or any portion of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate upon delivery to the Owner
Trustee of the documents required by Section 3.5 and
this Section 3.7 and, in the case of a Definitive
Certificate, surrender of such Definitive Certificate to the Owner
Trustee. Such transfer may be made by a registered
Certificateholder in person or by his attorney duly authorized in
writing upon (i) in the case of a Definitive Certificate,
surrender of such Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by
(x) a written instrument of transfer in the form of the
“Assignment” attached to the Form of Certificate
attached hereto as Exhibit A and with such signature
guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons signing the
instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require
and (y) an executed direction letter regarding registration of
such transfer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C ,
(ii) unless the transferee is a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller,
an executed Certificate Investor Representation Letter in the form
of Exhibit B (unless the Seller shall have received an
opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that
such transfer without an executed Certificate Investor
Representation Letter in the form of Exhibit B will not
cause the Issuer to be treated as an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and the Seller shall consent in writing that no such
written representation letter is required) and (iii) the
documents required by clause (c)  hereof. Promptly
upon the receipt of such documents and, in the case of a Definitive
Certificate, receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such
transferee as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in
the Certificate Register and, in the case of a Definitive
Certificate, issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a
Certificate evidencing such Percentage Interest. In the event a
transferor transfers only a portion of

Trust Agreement
(2014-4)







its Percentage Interest, the Owner
Trustee shall register and issue to such transferor a new
Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage
Interest. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of a new
Definitive Certificate or Definitive Certificates, the Owner
Trustee shall cancel and destroy the Definitive Certificate
surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. Unless
otherwise provided under applicable law, the Owner Trustee may
treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the
sole owner of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by
such Certificate, without regard to any notice to the
contrary.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.7 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), each transferee of a
Certificate (other than a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller) shall be
deemed to have acknowledged, represented and agreed as
follows:

(1) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) has neither acquired nor
will it transfer any Certificate it purchases (or any interest
therein) or cause any such Certificate (or any interest therein) to
be marketed on or through an “established securities
market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b)(1) of the
Code, including, without limitation, an over-the-counter market or
an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm
buy or sell quotations.

(2) Unless the Seller has received
an opinion from a nationally recognized tax counsel (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may rely on reasonable representations of the
applicable transferee or other applicable persons) that the
proposed transfer, without the representation pursuant to this
paragraph, will not cause the Issuer to be treated as an
association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the Seller has consented
to such transfer in writing, it (and any Person for which it holds
Certificates as agent or nominee, collectively for purposes of this
paragraph (2), a “transferee”) either (A) is not,
and will not become, a partnership, Subchapter S corporation or
grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or a
disregarded entity the single owner of which is any of the
foregoing) or (B) is such an entity, but no more than 50% of
the value of any of the direct or indirect beneficial interests in
such transferee (or in the case of a disregarded entity, the
interests of its single owner) is or will be attributable to such
transferee’s (or in the case of a disregarded entity, the
single owner’s) interest in Non-Investment Grade Notes,
Restricted Notes and the Certificates.

(3) It understands that if it is
acquiring any Certificate for the account of one or more Persons as
agent or nominee, (A) it shall provide to the Owner Trustee

changes in the number of such Persons and (B) any such change
in the number of Persons for whose account a Certificate is held
shall require the written consent of the Administrator,

behalf of the Issuer, which consent
shall be granted unless the Seller determines that such proposed
change in number of Persons would create a risk that the Issuer
would be classified for federal or any applicable state tax
purposes as an association (or a publicly traded partnership)
taxable as a corporation.

(4) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) understands that no
subsequent transfer of the Certificates (or any interest therein)
is permitted unless (A) such transfer is of a Certificate with
a Percentage Interest of more than 5% (or of an interest in a
Certificate representing a Percentage Interest of more than 5%) and
(B) the Seller, on behalf of the Issuer, consents in writing
to the proposed transfer, which consent shall be granted unless the
Seller determines that such transfer would either create a risk
that the Issuer would be classified for federal or any applicable
state tax purposes as an association (or a publicly traded
partnership) taxable as a corporation (e.g. the transfer
contravenes any of the provisions of Sections 3.7(c) or
3.7(h) or could cause the number of beneficial owners of
Non-Investment Grade Notes, Restricted Notes and the Certificates
(or interests therein) in the aggregate to exceed 95).

(5) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate is
a “United States person” (as defined in Code section
7701(a)(30)) and shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it
is a United States person and not subject to backup withholding, or
other information or documentation requested by the Administrator
or the Owner Trustee to determine, in its sole discretion, that
payments on such Certificates will not be subject to withholding
under U.S. tax law.

(6) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) understands that any
attempted transfer that contravenes any provisions of
Section 3.5(b) , Section 3.7(c) or
Section 3.7(h) shall be a void transfer ab
initio .

(d) Each purchaser, beneficial owner
and subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein
will be required or deemed to acknowledge that the Issuer may
provide any information concerning its investment in the
Certificates to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
each purchaser, beneficial owner and subsequent transferee of
Certificates or an interest therein will be required or deemed to
understand and acknowledge that the Issuer has the right,
hereunder, to withhold on any beneficial owner of an interest in a
Certificate that fails to comply with the foregoing
requirements.

(e) Each Certificate shall bear a
legend in substantially the following form, unless the Seller
determines otherwise in accordance with applicable law:

TRANSFEREE WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND
AGREEMENTS SET FORTH IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT. ANY TRANSFER IN

VOID AB INITIO, AND WILL NOT OPERATE TO TRANSFER ANY RIGHTS TO THE
PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE
CONTRARY TO THE ISSUER, THE OWNER TRUSTEE, OR ANY INTERMEDIARY. IF
AT ANY TIME, THE ISSUER DETERMINES OR IS NOTIFIED THAT THE
PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE OF SUCH CERTIFICATE OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST
IN SUCH CERTIFICATE WAS IN BREACH, AT THE TIME GIVEN, OF ANY OF THE
REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT, THE ISSUER AND
THE OWNER TRUSTEE MAY CONSIDER THE ACQUISITION OF THIS CERTIFICATE
OR SUCH INTEREST IN SUCH CERTIFICATE VOID AND REQUIRE THAT THIS

DESIGNATED BY THE ISSUER. TRANSFERS OF THIS CERTIFICATE MUST
GENERALLY BE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE TAX TRANSFER DOCUMENTATION
AND ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AS PROVIDED IN THE TRUST
AGREEMENT.

(f) If (1) a transfer or
attempted or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest
therein was consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.7 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee of a Certificate failed to deliver to the
Owner Trustee a Certificate Investor Representation Letter in the
form of Exhibit B hereto or (3) the Certificateholder
of any Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any Certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Owner Trustee will, upon actual knowledge of such circumstance,
direct the Certificate Registrar not to register such attempted or
purported transfer and, if a transfer has been registered, such
transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab initio and
shall not operate to transfer any rights to the purported
transferee (such purported transferee, a “Disqualified
Transferee”) and the last preceding Certificateholder of such
Certificateholder that was not a Disqualified Transferee shall be
restored to all rights as a Certificateholder thereof retroactively
to the date of the purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(g) Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or
Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated Certificate
is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the Owner Trustee
receives evidence to its satisfaction that any Certificate has been
destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of ownership satisfactory
to the Owner Trustee together with such security or indemnity as
may be requested by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, the
Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate for the
same Percentage Interest as the Certificate so mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen, of like tenor and bearing a different
issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee
shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under
this Section 3.7 , the Issuer or Owner
Trustee
 












  



14


  


Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2014-4)







may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the
Certificate and any other reasonable expenses (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer and the Owner Trustee)
connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to
this Section 3.7 shall constitute complete and
indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally
issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
shall be found at any time.

(h) No transfer of the Certificates
(or any interest therein) is permitted unless (1) such
transfer is of a Certificate with a Percentage Interest of more
than 5% (or of an interest in a Certificate representing a
Percentage Interest of more than 5%) and (2) the Seller, on
behalf of the Issuer, consents in writing to the proposed transfer,
which consent shall be granted unless the Seller determines that
such transfer would either create a risk that the Issuer would be
classified for federal or any applicable state tax purposes as an
association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a
corporation (e.g. the transfer contravenes any of the provisions of
Sections 3.7(c) or 3.7(h) or could cause the number
of beneficial owners of Non-Investment Grade Notes, Restricted
Notes and the Certificates (or interests therein) in the aggregate
to exceed 95) .

(i) In the case of the first
transfer of a Certificate that will result in the Issuer being
deemed to have more than one beneficial owner for federal income
tax purposes, the Seller shall be entitled to request an Initial
Certificate Transfer Opinion.

SECTION 3.8. Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . To the extent Definitive
Certificates have been issued, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Seller or an affiliate of
the Seller is the sole Certificateholder. Any Certificate Paying
Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the
Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such
power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement
in any material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
initially be Wilmington Trust, and any co-paying agent chosen by
the Certificate Paying Agent. Wilmington Trust shall be permitted
to resign as Certificate Paying Agent upon thirty
(30) days’ written notice to the Owner Trustee. If
Wilmington Trust shall no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent,
the Owner Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as Certificate
Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner
Trustee shall cause such successor Certificate Paying Agent or any
additional Certificate Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee
to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which
such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate
Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that as Certificate
Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it
for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of
the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be
paid to such Certificateholders. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon

Trust Agreement
(2014-4)






removal of a Certificate Paying Agent such
Certificate Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The rights, protections,
indemnities and immunities of the Owner Trustee under this
Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as
Certificate Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as
the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent or
Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to any other
paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating agent
appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.

SECTION 3.9. Maintenance of
Office or Agency . As long as any of the Certificates remain
outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain an office or agency where
Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in
respect of the Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The
Issuer hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of
the Certificate Registrar for the foregoing purposes. The Issuer
shall give prompt written notice to the Certificateholders and the
Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the location,
of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail
to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the
Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such surrenders, notices
and demands may be made or served at the applicable Corporate Trust
Office of the Owner Trustee, and the Issuer hereby appoints the
Owner Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders, notices
and demands.

ARTICLE IV

ACTIONS BY OWNER
TRUSTEE

SECTION 4.1. Prior Notice to
Certificateholders with Respect to Certain Matters . With
respect to the following matters, unless the Administrator notifies
the Owner Trustee that the Indenture, the Purchase Agreement or the
Sale and Servicing Agreement, as applicable, provides that the
consent of the Certificateholders shall not be required, the Owner
Trustee shall not take action unless at least 10 days before the
taking of such action (or if 10 days’ advance notice is
impracticable, as much advance notice as is practicable), the Owner
Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholders in writing of
the proposed action and within 10 days of such notice (or such
shorter time as specified in such notice) none of the
Certificateholders shall have notified the Owner Trustee in writing
that such Certificateholder has withheld consent or provided
alternative direction:

(a) the amendment of the Indenture
by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the consent of
any Noteholder is required;

(b) the amendment of the Indenture
by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the consent of
any Noteholder is not required and such amendment materially
adversely affects the interests of the
Certificateholders;

(c) the amendment, change or
modification of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or the
Administration Agreement, except to cure any ambiguity or defect or
to amend or supplement any provision in a manner that would not
materially adversely affect the interests of the
Certificateholders; or

(d) the appointment pursuant to the
Indenture of a successor Indenture Trustee or the consent to the

(a) The Issuer shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Owner Trustee and 100% of the
Certificateholders, commence a Bankruptcy Event with respect to the
Issuer. In considering whether to give or withhold written consent
to the Bankruptcy Event by the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, with the
consent of the Certificateholders, shall consider the interests of
the Noteholders in addition to the interests of the Issuer and
whether the Issuer is insolvent. The Owner Trustee shall have no
duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Event by the
Issuer if the Owner Trustee shall not have been furnished (at the
expense of the Person that requested such letter be furnished to
the Owner Trustee) a letter from an independent accounting firm of
national reputation stating that in the opinion of such firm the
Issuer is then insolvent. The Owner Trustee shall not be personally
liable to any Noteholder or Certificateholder on account of the
Owner Trustee’s good faith reliance on the provisions of this
Section 4.3 and no Noteholder or Certificateholder
shall have any claim for breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise
against the Owner Trustee for giving or withholding its consent to
any such Bankruptcy Event.

(b) The parties hereto stipulate and
agree that no Certificateholder has the power to commence any
Bankruptcy Action on the part of the Issuer.

SECTION 4.4. Restrictions on
Certificateholders’ Power . The Certificateholders shall
not direct the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action if such action or inaction would be contrary to any
obligation of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee under this Agreement
or any of the Transaction Documents or would be contrary to
Section 2.3 , nor shall the Owner Trustee be obligated
to follow any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5. Acts of
Certificateholders; Majority Control .

(a) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by

(2014-4)







be embodied in and evidenced by one
or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such
Certificateholders in person or by agents duly appointed in
writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly provided such
action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments
are delivered to the Owner Trustee, and, where it is hereby
expressly required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments
(and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein
sometimes referred to as the “Act” of the
Certificateholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any
such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement
and (subject to Article VI ) conclusive in favor of the
Owner Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in
this Section 4.5 .

(b) The fact and date of the
execution by any person of any such instrument or writing may be
proved in any manner that the Owner Trustee deems
sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Certificates
shall be proved by the Certificate Register.

(d) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
by any Certificateholder shall bind the Holder of every Certificate
issued upon the registration thereof or in exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to
be done by the Owner Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon such
Certificate.

(e) Except as otherwise provided
herein, to the extent that there is more than one
Certificateholder, any action which may be taken or consent or
instructions which may be given by the Certificateholders under
this Agreement may be taken by the Majority Certificateholders at
the time of such action.

ARTICLE V

CERTAIN DUTIES

SECTION 5.1. Application of Trust
Funds . Deposits into the Certificate Distribution Account
shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture,
the Sale and Servicing Agreement and this Agreement. On each
Payment Date to the extent Definitive Certificates have been
issued, the Certificate Paying Agent shall withdraw from the
Certificate Distribution Account and distribute to the
Certificateholders, pro rata based on the Percentage Interest of
each Certificateholder, all funds received in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture and this Agreement. Subject to the Lien
of the Indenture and Section 5.5 of this Agreement, the
Certificate Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the
Certificateholders all other amounts (if any) received by the
Certificate Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the
Trust Estate (pro rata based on the Percentage Interest of each
such Certificateholder). After the termination of the Indenture in
accordance with its terms, the Certificate Paying Agent, in
accordance with the written direction of the Administrator pursuant

the Trust Estate to or at the direction of the Certificateholders

SECTION 5.2. Method of
Payment . Subject to the Indenture and the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, distributions required to be made to the
Certificateholders on any Payment Date and all amounts received by
the Issuer or the Owner Trustee on any other date that are payable
to the Certificateholders pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document shall be made to the Certificateholders by
wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of
each Certificateholder designated by the Certificateholder to the
Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee in writing.

SECTION 5.3. Reports by Owner
Trustee to Certificateholders . (a) The Administrator
shall prepare, or, at the request and expense of the Administrator,
the Owner Trustee shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and the
Administrator shall sign on behalf of the Issuer, the
Issuer’s tax returns, if any, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder or the Owner Trustee to sign such
documents.

(a) The Administrator shall prepare
and deliver, or, at the request of the Administrator, the Owner
Trustee shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to each
Certificateholder, as may be required by the Code and applicable
Treasury Regulations, such information as may be required
(including Schedule K-1, if applicable) to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax
returns.

(b) As long as the Issuer is treated
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and the Seller or
a U.S. Affiliate is a beneficial owner of a Certificate, to the
extent allowed by the Code, the Seller or such U.S. Affiliate shall
be designated the “tax matters partner” of the Trust
pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code and applicable
Treasury Regulations. If neither the Seller nor an Affiliate of the
Seller is a beneficial owner of a Certificate, then the
Certificateholder with the largest Percentage Interest shall be
designated the “tax matters partner” of the Issuer
pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code and applicable
Treasury Regulations.

SECTION 5.4. Certificate
Distribution Account . The Certificate Distribution Account
shall be established as a non-interest bearing trust account

Agreement. Funds on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account
shall be held uninvested. The Certificateholders shall possess all
beneficial right, title and interest in and to all funds on deposit
from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account and all
proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, in the
Indenture or in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate
Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Certificate Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution
Account ceases to be an Eligible Account, the Owner Trustee (or the
Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate
Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner Trustee or an
Affiliate thereof) shall within ten (10) Business Days (or
such longer period) establish a new Certificate Distribution
Account as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any cash then on
deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account to such new
Certificate Distribution Account.

SECTION 5.5. Withholding
.

(a) If any withholding tax is
imposed on the Issuer’s payment (or allocations of income) to
a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this
Section 5.5 ; provided that the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Paying Agent shall not have an obligation to withhold
any such amount if and for so long as the Seller or a U.S.
Affiliate of the Seller is the sole Certificateholder. The Owner
Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent is hereby authorized and
directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable to the
Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that
is legally owed by the Issuer (but such authorization shall not
prevent the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent from
contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and withholding
payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of
such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with
respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed
to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Issuer
and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a
distribution, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent may
in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this Section 5.5 .

(b) With respect to any and all
payments to a Certificateholder, (i) the Certificateholder
will provide to the applicable withholding agent (including the
Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent), any documentation
or certification required or reasonably appropriate for the such
withholding agent to satisfy its obligations with respect to FATCA,
if any, and to determine whether any withholding tax may be
required to be withheld pursuant to FATCA; and (ii) the
Certificateholder acknowledges and agrees that the applicable
withholding agent (including, if applicable, the Owner Trustee or
the Certificate Paying Agent) shall have the right to deduct and
withhold any required U.S. withholding tax, including any
withholding tax pursuant to FATCA, on any amounts payable with
respect to the Certificates (without any corresponding gross-up or
other indemnification) if any such Certificateholder or beneficial
owner either is subject to withholding under FATCA, fails to comply
with the documentation requirements in clause (i), or otherwise
fails to establish a complete exemption from such withholding tax
to the reasonable satisfaction of the applicable withholding agent
(including, if applicable, the Owner Trustee or the Paying
Agent).

ARTICLE VI

Documents. The Owner Trustee is further authorized from time to
time to take such action as the Seller, the Administrator or a
Majority of the Certificateholders direct in writing with respect
to the Transaction Documents, except to the extent that this
Agreement expressly requires the consent of each Certificateholder
for such action.

SECTION 6.2. General Duties .
It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to discharge (or cause to
be discharged) all of its express responsibilities pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents in the
interest of the Certificateholders, subject to Transaction
Documents, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to
have discharged its duties and responsibilities hereunder and under
the Transaction Documents to the extent the Administrator has
agreed in the Administration Agreement to perform any act or to
discharge any duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee hereunder or
under any Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be
liable for the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out
its obligations under the Administration Agreement and shall have
no duty to monitor the performance of the Administrator or any
other Person under the Administration Agreement or any other
document. The Owner Trustee shall have no obligation to administer,
service or collect the Receivables or to maintain, monitor or
otherwise supervise the administration, servicing or collection of
the Receivables.

SECTION 6.3. Action upon
Instruction .

(a) Subject to Article IV ,
and in accordance with the Transaction Documents, the
Certificateholders may, by written instruction, direct the Owner
Trustee or the Administrator in the management of the Issuer. Such
direction may be exercised at any time by written instruction of
the Certificateholders pursuant to Article IV .

(b) Subject to
Section 7.1 , the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take any action hereunder or under any Transaction Document if
the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined or been advised
by counsel that such action is likely to result in liability on the
part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that
this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is
silent or is incomplete

(2014-4)







as to the course of action that the
Owner Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set
of facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such
form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the
Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of
action to be adopted or application of such provision, and to the
extent the Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith
in accordance with any written instruction of the Majority
Certificateholders (or, if specifically required hereunder, all
Certificateholders) received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
on account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner
Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as
reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary
under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to,
take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, as it shall deem to be in
the best interests of the Certificateholders, and shall have no
liability to any Person for such action or inaction.

SECTION 6.4. No Duties Except as
Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions . The Owner
Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any
payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or
otherwise deal with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any
document contemplated hereby to which the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms of
this Agreement or in any document or written instruction received
by the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 6.3 ; and no
implied duties (including fiduciary duties existing at law or in
equity) or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or any
Transaction Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee
shall have no responsibility for filing any financing or
continuation statement in any public office at any time or to
otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security
interest or Lien granted to it hereunder or to prepare or file any
Commission filing (including any filings required under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) for the Issuer or to record this Agreement or
any Transaction Document. Wilmington Trust nevertheless agrees that
it will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take all action as
may be necessary to discharge any Liens on any part of the Trust
Estate that result from actions by, or claims against, Wilmington
Trust that are not related to the ownership or the administration
of the Trust Estate or the Trust.

SECTION 6.5. No Action Except
under Specified Documents or Instructions . The Owner Trustee
shall not manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal
with any part of the Trust Estate except (i) in accordance
with the powers granted to and the authority conferred upon the
Owner Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) in accordance
with the Transaction Documents and (iii) in accordance with
any document or instruction delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant
to Section 6.3 .

SECTION 6.6. Restrictions .
The Owner Trustee shall not take any action (a) that is
inconsistent with the purposes of the Issuer set forth in
Section 2.3 or (b) that, to the actual knowledge
of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee, would
(i) affect the treatment of the Notes as indebtedness for
federal income, state and local income, franchise and value added
tax purposes, (ii) be deemed to cause a taxable exchange of
the Notes for federal income or state income or franchise tax
purposes or (iii) cause the Issuer or any portion thereof to
be treated as
