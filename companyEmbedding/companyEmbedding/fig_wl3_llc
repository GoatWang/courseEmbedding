 Wasteland 3 Fig Shares Approved, inXile Boss Stepping Down    Visit the New ForumXFacebook IconTwitter Icongoogle-plus-icon-logoYouTube IconRSS IconSearch IconSearch for:  HOTPS4PS VRPSNPS VitaReviewsVideosForums   PSLS  •  News  •  PS4 News, Trophies, Reviews, and MoreWasteland 3 Fig Shares Get SEC Approval, inXile Boss to Step Down Following the Game’s ReleaseMarch 26, 2017
Written by Zarmena Khan inXile Entertainment’s Wasteland 3 has been a crowdfunding success as it accumulated more than $3.1 million in funding and investment reservations from 17,707 fans. Fig, which allows fans to invest in game shares, has now announced in a press release that Wasteland 3‘s shares have been approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). What this simply means is that fans and backers who want to benefit from the game’s financial success can now own a stake.“Fig Publishing, Inc. will soon reach out to investors with details to complete their investments online,” wrote the company. “Backers should review the offering circular for Fig Game Shares – WL3 that will be available on Fig’s website and the SEC’s website.”In related news, inXile CEO Brian Fargo has announced that he’ll be retiring from the industry as soon as Wasteland 3 ships in 2019. In an interview with Eurogamer last week, Brian – who has been in the industry since 1981 – has said that it seems like a good time to “drop the mic.”Wasteland 2 and Torment both came out great. The Mage’s Tale’s got a great buzz. The Bard’s Tale 4 looks spectacular. Wasteland 3 is building on Wasteland 2. It seems like a good time to drop the mic.Fargo has worked on a number of successful titles including Fallout. He founded inXile in late 2002.

Tomato Chutney



Our tomato chutney is the perfect condiment for meats (especially pork) and vegetables. Think of it as a complex spicy topping somewhere between a sauce and catsup. The kick comes primarily from fresh ginger root and garlic. Note to those with nut allergies: Our Tomato Chutney contains slivered almonds.














Pickled Onion Rings



Our favorite burger topping; mildly spicy and crisp to provide a little crunch and zing to your burgers.














Spicy Pickled Okra



A late summer / fall offering. We use small (one to two bites) okra pods. They have an intense (and some say addictive) flavor.














Strawberry Jam



When the local strawberries show up at market, we make as much of this product as we can, and it is never enough. Our goal is to accent the natural flavor of the fresh berries. Typically we sell this product in May and are sold out in June.














Blackberry Jam



We produce this product with fresh blackberries from local growers. We make batches with-seeds and without. This is a jam, not a jelly: not as thick as a jelly. Perfect for spooning over pancakes or spreading on toast or a biscuit. We love it on PB&J sandwiches.














Spicy Pickled Peaches



Pickled peaches were once a staple on the southern table and are hard to find these days. We make a limited quantity of Pickled Peaches that are spicy and bursting with flavor. These are the perfect side to compliment pork or other meats and are used in many Southern recipes.














Peaches in Amaretto Syrup



When the peaches hit the local farmers market, we get busy making as many jars of this as we have time to. It is never enough and we sell out quickly. These peach halves make a delightful finale to a special meal when served over vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.














Watermelon Rind Pickles



If we can find thick-rind watermelons late in the summer, we offer these. Crisp and sweet with just a hint of spice.














Old Fashioned Fig Preserves



Our fig preserves are made from the fruit of our ancient Brown Turkey fig tree. The tree produces a small fig crop in late July / early August from which we make this preserve. Our fig preserves replicate those common in the early and mid Twentieth Century. The figs are whole or halved and this preserve is accented with ginger and lemon slices. These are a perfect topping for a breakfast biscuit or muffin.














Pepper Jellies



We grow our own Jalapeno, Cayenne, and Scotch Bonnet chiles and create hot pepper jellies that capture the unique flavors of these peppers. The Cayenne and Jalapeno jellies are modestly hot, while the Scotch Bonne jelly is quite a bite. We make a limited quantity of extra-hot pepper jellies for customers who need even more heat.














Green Tomato Pickles



When green tomatoes start showing up at local farmers markets, we make this very labor intensive pickle using a very old recipe. These take three days to produce and are made in very limited quantities. They are crisp, tart, spicy and slightly sweet- the perfect accompaniment for a special dinner plate. This is one of our family’s favorite pickles and it is perfect for special occasions.
