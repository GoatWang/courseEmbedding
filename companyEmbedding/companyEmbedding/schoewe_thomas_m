Thomas M. Schoewe (born 1952) was the chief financial officer and executive vice president of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. until January 2011.[1] He was with the company since taking his positions in January 2000. Prior to joining Wal-Mart he was with Black and Decker where he held the same positions of CFO and executive vice president from 1993-1999. He attended Loyola University Chicago where he graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in finance.
In August 2005, Schoewe served a prison sentence after being convicted of driving his red Corvette 110 miles per hour at 1:30 a.m. on January 1, 2005. There were reports that at the time of the incident Mr. Schoewe was under the influence of alcohol. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Mona Williams commented on the incident, stating, "We all know it was a foolish thing to do. He learned from it, and as far as we're concerned it is behind us."
