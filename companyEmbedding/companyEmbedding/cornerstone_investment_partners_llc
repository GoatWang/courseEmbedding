Experience and Team
	
	There is no substitute for experience. The portfolio management team shares over 100 years of investment analysis and portfolio management experience. For nearly 30 of those years, the members of the portfolio management team have worked together adhering to the same investment philosophy, exercising the same approach to security selection and employing the same discipline as it pertains to portfolio design. Despite the numerous times we have heard "It's different this time," experience has taught us it rarely is. Regardless of the environment, Cornerstone portfolio managers have maintained their focus on buying high quality companies at attractive prices while exercising the patience necessary to unlock the value.

Cornerstone exists for our clients, and we are uniquely focused on managing portfolios for them. Through careful business planning we have largely eliminated distractions from our daily work that has allowed us to spend most of our time and energy on investing. In every decision we make, the client comes first. We believe Cornerstone will only do as well as our clients, and in fact, we are invested alongside our clients.


Cornerstone focuses on what we do best, picking stocks. Our investment process is based on the philosophy that stock prices move more than the underlying fundamentals that determine value. Over time, we believe this philosophy and process will offer us a very good probability of providing consistent and predictable returns for our clients.


Cornerstone uses an investment valuation model, which is based on sound financial theory and has strong statistical merit, to identify stocks we believe are undervalued. More than 20 years of experience with this model, including some of the most stressful times since the 1930's, have led us to focus our rigorous fundamental work on the most attractive stocks identified by this model. Through the resulting portfolio, we strive to outperform the benchmark while undertaking less downside risk.

We Believe...

Investment professionals should invest alongside their clients




Description
Cornerstone's Compass portfolio is a new twist on the old notion of a traditional balanced account. Cornerstone realizes that stocks do not always assume the same level of risk-there are in fact times when the broad market is not fairly valued relative to the underlying fundamentals. Cornerstone also understands that stocks perform better when they are undervalued. Given those facts, we believe we can add excess return and reduce risk by adjusting the allocation between stocks and bonds to reflect better where the more attractive opportunities lie.

We Believe...

Investor capital should be protected





Description
Cornerstone Investment Partners believes that stock prices are far more volatile than the fundamentals that determine value.  This belief stems from the observation that the market tends to overreact to incremental pieces of information, whether pushing prices too far to the downside on pessimistic outlooks or pushing prices too high as optimism flourishes.  Particularly for small cap stocks, investor perceptions often change quickly and even independently of the fundamentals a company is likely to achieve.  Cornerstone uses the stock price today to identify what the market expects in terms of profitably and growth from companies and identifies those opportunities where there is an asymmetrical payoff function given unlikely market expectations.  The portfolio focuses on companies with market capitalizations between $250 million and $3 billion at the time of purchase.  Cornerstone’s Opportunistic Small Cap Value portfolio is comprised of 60 stocks, conviction weights with position sizes with a maximum of 5% in any one name.  Sector weights are constrained to the greater of the benchmark weight or 30% of the portfolio with no minimum.

Cornerstone Investment Partners’ has constructed a universe of 800 large, liquid securities, including non-US companies, traded on US exchanges.  At some point the past the composite was referenced as Concentrated Equity Institutional. Cornerstone Investment Partners is an independent, privately held investment advisory firm structured as a limited liability company that is wholly owned by professionals actively involved in managing the business. The firm maintains a complete list and description of composites, which is available upon request. Results are based on fully discretionary accounts under management, including those accounts no longer with the firm. Past performance is not indicative of future results. N.A.- Information is not statistically meaningful due to an insufficient number of portfolios in the composite for the entire year. The U.S. Dollar is the currency used to express performance. Returns are presented gross and net of management fees and include the reinvestment of all income. Gross returns were reduced by transaction costs. Net of fee performance was calculated using actual management fees. Beginning October 1, 2008, composite policy requires the temporary removal of any portfolio incurring a client initiated significant cash inflow or outflow of 30% of portfolio assets. The Concentrated 30 Composite was created on April 1, 2010. The annual composite dispersion is an asset-weighted standard deviation calculated for the accounts in the composite the entire year. Cornerstone Investment Partners claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. Cornerstone Investment Partners has been independently verified for the periods beginning September 30, 2001 thru March31, 2017. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. The Concentrated 30 Institutional Composite has been examined for the periods September 30, 2001 thru March 31, 2017. The verification and performance examination reports are available upon request. As of January 1, 2007, the composite was split into a tax sensitive composite and a non-tax sensitive composite to better reflect our performance for each account type. Additional information regarding the policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request.

CornerStone Partners LLC
Full-service CIO and Investment Office for Endowments,
          
      Foundations and Not-For-Profits


The choice of an investment advisory firm is one of the most important decisions that an endowment, foundation, or not-for-profit can make. Assessing the differences among firms, however, can be a challenge. At CornerStone Partners, we believe four key characteristics distinguish us. These are:

Judgment and insights shaped by broad experience
Exceptional service focused on a small number of select clients
For each client, a customized portfolio of thoroughly vetted investment managers
Established processes and a long track record of strong investment results


CornerStone clients value these distinctions. Each chose us at a time when their needs had outgrown the service model of a traditional consulting firm or required more flexibility than a typical outsourced-CIO firm. By choosing CornerStone, our clients realize the benefits of a fully staffed internal CIO and investment office, on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, without the many challenges of building and maintaining an in-house department.

Through careful business planning we have largely eliminated distractions from our daily work that has allowed us to spend most of our time and energy on investing. In every decision we make, the client comes first. We believe Cornerstone will only do as well as our clients, and in fact, we are invested alongside our clients.

Cornerstone uses an investment valuation model, which is based on sound financial theory and has strong statistical merit, to identify stocks we believe are undervalued. More than 20 years of experience with this model, including some of the most stressful times since the 1930's, have led us to focus our rigorous fundamental work on the most attractive stocks identified by this model. Through the resulting portfolio, we strive to outperform the benchmark while undertaking less downside risk.
