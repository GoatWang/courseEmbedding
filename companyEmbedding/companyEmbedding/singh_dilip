Dileep SinghMaterials Scientist - Energy SystemsDileep Singh leads the Thermal Management efforts at Argonne’s Center for Transportation Research. He and his group investigate innovative technologies for improving the cooling in heavy-duty truck engines and power electronics used in hybrid electric vehicles.  Using multifunctional nanoparticles, he is working on the development of heat transfer fluids with enhanced thermo-physical properties for concentrated solar power (CSP), power plant cooling, and power electronics applications.  In addition, he is involved in the development of high-efficiency thermal energy storage systems for CSP and vehicle systems.
Singh is a co-inventor of the low-temperature phosphate ceramics technology, CeramicreteTM, and has worked extensively in the development of phosphate ceramics for structural, nuclear materials storage, and waste disposal applications. The technology has been licensed by Argonne to several companies for use in commercial and government sector applications.
Early in his career, Singh’s work focused on the mechanical behavior and reliability of structural ceramics and composite materials. He has conducted fundamental and applied research on high-temperature plastic deformation as a joining technique for ceramics. He has applied the plastic deformation process to fabricate ceramic gas oxygen and NOx electrochemical sensors that can operate at high temperatures (>600°C). Applications for these sensors are in the manufacturing and transportation industries.
