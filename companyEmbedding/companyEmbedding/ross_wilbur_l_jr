Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]

Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor expected to be nominated as the next commerce secretary, has made his fortune through the tricky business of buying deeply troubled companies.With wealth estimated at $2.9 billion, Mr. Ross, who turns 79 on Monday, would join a cabinet that is already expected to include one of the superwealthy in Betsy DeVos, the nominee for secretary of education, and that may soon have others.In choosing Mr. Ross to be the face of American business for the rest of the world, President-elect Donald J. Trump is turning not to a cautious corporate chieftain, but to a risk-taking speculator. Like his presumptive boss, Mr. Ross has been considered either a hero or a villain during his career. There is not a lot in between.In 2002, he won praise from workers when he bought the shuttered steel mills of LTV, a bankrupt company in Cleveland. Four years later, Mr. Ross was pilloried after an explosion at the Sago Mine in West Virginia, which his company had bought a few weeks earlier, killed 12 miners.

The stark contrasts reflect the nature of the world in which Mr. Ross operates: distressed investing. He made his name scouring the landscape for businesses left for dead that he could sink money into and then profit from when they were resurrected. Continue reading the main story

It is a business that requires nerves of steel and a strong stomach. The chances of failure — along with headlines about collapsed businesses and lost jobs — are balanced against the opportunity for a big reward if a turnaround strategy works.Some businesses where he has invested, like textile mills, have struggled. But other investments have salvaged industry and jobs while providing a lucrative payday.His best-known bet was in the steel industry more than a decade ago, a time when few wanted anything to do with it. Mr. Ross cobbled together the ailing assets of LTV and Bethlehem Steel into a new company called International Steel Group, which was sold in 2004 to Mittal Steel for $4.5 billion.“There were no outsiders who were willing to step forward and make an investment,” said Ron Bloom, an investment banker who negotiated with Mr. Ross for the United Steelworkers. “He went where angels feared to tread.”Like his investing, the politics of Mr. Ross, a former Democrat, do not always stick to orthodox points of view.Mr. Ross has expressed strong conservative beliefs on some issues — favoring big tax cuts for businesses, for example, and a repeal of President Obama’s health law. Yet Mr. Ross has also suggested that he is receptive to some of the anti-trade views favored by American labor unions and by Mr. Trump.“The president has a huge amount of fire in terms of abrogating treaties, and he can do a lot without reference to Congress,” Mr. Ross said in an interview the day after the election.

Mr. Ross, a member of Mr. Trump’s economic team during the campaign, said he expected the new president to do a lot on trade and regulation through executive action.“He is serious about suspending any new regulations,” said Mr. Ross, who held one of Mr. Trump’s first fund-raisers.A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Jason Miller, said: “Though President-elect Trump has not yet announced his pick for this position, it goes without saying that Mr. Ross has been a fantastic advocate for the president-elect’s plan to bring back jobs, eliminate the trade deficit and make good deals for America’s workers.”The nomination of Mr. Ross would be the capstone to a career on Wall Street that has spanned decades and has made him one of the most visible and successful of a breed of investor known as “vultures” because of their penchant for going after nearly dead businesses.

Mr. Ross, by contrast, has often preferred to see himself as another kind of bird — the mythical phoenix, helping businesses rise from the ashes.To some degree, Mr. Ross helped Mr. Trump do that when some of his casinos in Atlantic City fell on hard times. Mr. Ross and Carl C. Icahn, another billionaire investor and supporter of Mr. Trump, were both bondholders in the Trump Taj Mahal casino when it was teetering on financial collapse in 1990. Instead of pushing the casino into an immediate bankruptcy, Mr. Ross and Mr. Icahn worked with Mr. Trump and others to structure a more orderly bankruptcy filing in 1991.The negotiated restructuring helped Mr. Trump salvage his name and brand at a time when he arguably did not have many friends on Wall Street.The low point of Mr. Ross’s career was the deadly mine disaster in West Virginia. Although he helped set up a charitable fund for the families of the victims, and his company contributed more than $1 million to them as well, some in organized labor remain bitter about Mr. Ross and his firm.Still, that episode has not deterred some unions from doing business with him when it was in their interest. In 2012, Mr. Ross was one of the wealthy investors who gave a $50 million cash infusion to Amalgamated Bank, one of the nation’s largest union-owned lenders, which was struggling to stay in business after the financial crisis.

An affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, which controlled the ailing Amalgamated Bank, did not hesitate to take Mr. Ross’s money.“Wilbur Ross’s investment firm has been an investor in the bank and held a seat on our board for nearly five years,” said Loren Riegelhaupt, a spokesman for Amalgamated Bank. “While we appreciate his financial acumen, his relationship to the bank has never impacted our core progressive principles: providing quality financial services to our clients while advancing the values we believe in.”Mr. Ross sold his firm in 2006 to Invesco, an Atlanta-based investment company, for about $375 million. Since then, he has pulled back on the daily operations of the business.While remaining as chairman of the firm, Mr. Ross has spent more time in recent years at his Palm Beach, Fla., home, not far from Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Largo estate.Mr. Ross was born in Weehawken, N.J., and has been married three times. His second wife, Betsy McCaughey, a Republican, served as New York’s lieutenant governor from 1995 to 1998. The experience, Mr. Ross would later tell New York magazine, “gave one a very close-up view of politics.” Ms. McCaughey, too, was named to Mr. Trump’s economic team during the campaign.Some suggest Mr. Ross’s business ties may pose potential conflicts of interest. But the sale of his company, W.L. Ross, may make it easier for Mr. Ross to separate himself from its far-flung interests, which include businesses in Europe, China and India. His remaining financial interests in the firm’s funds could be put in a blind trust, and he could easily resign from the five corporate boards on which he sits.Still, those overseas deals could raise questions about his relationships with foreign leaders and businesspeople from China and Russia.He is vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, the biggest bank in that European island nation, and he is credited with helping the bank to recover from a severe crisis in 2013. But Mr. Ross’s investment in the bank also makes him a de facto business partner with Viktor F. Vekselberg, one of Russia’s most prominent businesspeople and a man with ties to the Kremlin.Mr. Ross has complained about China’s having taken jobs from Americans — a message similar to the one Mr. Trump repeated throughout his campaign. Yet for all the anti-China commentary, Mr. Ross has been a frequent visitor in the past two decades and has made inroads in that country’s energy industry.

Mr. Ross linked up with the most powerful player in the country’s power generation business, China Huaneng Group, in 2008. The state-owned company had been run for years by the eldest son of Li Peng, the former prime minister who was the godfather of the country’s electricity industry.

Today Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence as 39th Secretary of Commerce.  Secretary Ross will be the principal voice of business in the Trump Administration, ensuring U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses have the tools they need to create jobs and economic opportunity. 
“President Trump used to say on the campaign trail that he had a three-part agenda for the American economy:  Jobs, jobs, and jobs,” said Vice President Pence. “With Wilbur Ross as our new Secretary of Commerce, the President and I are confident that the Department of Commerce is going to take its right and leading role in fostering the growth that will create good-paying jobs for every American.”
Secretary Ross will work with businesses, universities, communities, and the Nation's workers to promote job creation, economic growth, sustainable development, and improved standards of living.  He succeeds Secretary Penny Pritzker, who served in the position under President Obama.
“I’m very gratified at the confidence that the President and the Vice President has shown in me and in the Department, and I promise I will live up to every word of my oath,” said Secretary Ross. “I was also very gratified by last night’s vote being 72 to 27, because that suggests that perhaps finally building America up again may become a bipartisan thing rather than contentious. I hope that spirit will carry over as people respond to the State of the Union message tonight.”
Secretary Ross is the former Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer of WL Ross & Co. LLC and has over 55 years of investment banking and private equity experience.  Mr. Ross has restructured over $400 billion of assets in the airline, apparel, auto parts, banking, beverage, chemical, credit card, electric utility, food service, furniture, gypsum, home-building, insurance, marine transport, mortgage origination and servicing, oil and gas, rail car manufacturing and leasing, real estate, restaurants, shipyards, steel, textiles, and trucking industries.  He has been chairman or lead director of more than 100 companies operating in more than 20 different countries. 
Named by Bloomberg Markets as one of the 50 most influential people in global finance, Mr. Ross is the only person elected to both the Private Equity Hall of Fame and the Turnaround Management Hall of Fame.  He previously served as privatization advisor to New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund.  President Kim Dae-jung awarded Mr. Ross a medal for helping South Korea during its financial crisis and, in November 2014, the Emperor of Japan awarded him The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star.
As a philanthropist, Secretary Ross recently served as Chairman of the Japan Society, Trustee of the Brookings Institution and Chairman of its Economic Studies Council, the International Board of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, the Blenheim Foundation, the Magritte Museum in Brussels, and the Palm Beach Civic Association.  He was also an Advisory Board Member of Yale University School of Management.
Secretary Ross is a graduate of Yale University and of Harvard Business School (with distinction).  He and his wife Hilary Geary Ross have four children, Jessica Ross, Amanda Ross, Ted Geary, and Jack Geary.

(Reuters)   Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., a former banker and investor who earned billions during decades of buying and selling industries and who President Trump has touted to lead his trade negotiations, was confirmed as secretary of commerce by the Senate in a 72-to-27 vote on Monday night. Dubbed the “king of bankruptcy” for his leveraged buyouts of battered companies in the steel, coal, textile and banking industries, Ross has generated a fortune of $2.5 billion, ranking him among the wealthiest 250 people in America, according to Forbes. Ross worked for decades at the New York investment bank of Rothschild, during which time he represented Trump's failing Taj Mahal casino and helped forge a deal that allowed Trump to retain ownership. In the early 2000s, Ross purchased some of America’s largest steel mills, including Pennsylvania’s Bethlehem Steel and Cleveland’s LTV Corp. He later sold his steel conglomerate to India’s Mittal Steel, helping to form what is now the world’s largest steel company. Ross’s confirmation was largely uncontroversial, though Sen. Cory Booker (D.-N.J.) and other Democrats asked the billionaire in recent days to clarify his business ties to Russian shareholders while serving on the board of directors of a Cypriot bank. Some critics have condemn Ross for taking over troubled companies and shipping jobs overseas, while his supporters claim he saved the companies from going under and preserved American jobs in the process. Trump has praised Ross as a savvy businessman and one of the most valuable advisers in his administration. Ross agreed to divest of nearly all of his personal holdings and resigned from dozens of boards and organizations to take the Commerce Department post. Trump has said that Ross will help to lead the administration’s trade policy, a position typically held by the U.S. trade representative, rather than the commerce secretary. His role will presumably include helping to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and other deals to win better terms of trade for the United States. “I am not anti-trade, I am pro-trade, but I am pro-sensible trade, not pro-trade that is to the disadvantage of the American worker in the American manufacturing community,” Ross said in his confirmation hearing before the Senate commerce committee on Jan. 18. “I think we should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not, should not get away with it, they should be punished and severely,” he said. The Commerce Department has more than 40,000 employees and oversees wide-ranging government services, including the Census Bureau, weather forecasting, trade and fishery management.         business  wonkblog     false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

Private Equity Billionaire Wilbur L. Ross: Man 'Over Board'?









Ronald Orol




Jun 29, 2015 10:03 AM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK ( The Deal) -- Late last year private equity billionaire  Wilbur L. Ross Jr. -- best known for restructuring failed companies in the steel industry and other sectors -- was elected as vice chairman of the Bank of Cypress.   Ross joined a newly constituted board to help the embattled institution complete a turnaround after Cypress was rocked by a Greek debt crisis. His buyout shop, WL Ross & Co. LLC, owns a 19% stake.   In a statement, Ross noted at the time that due to "new European rules" limiting directorships of bank officers that he was resigning from the boards of several other companies including Assured Guaranty, International Automotive Components Group, International Textile Group  ( ITXN), Navigator Holdings ( NVGS), Talmer Bancorp  ( TLMR) and embattled mortgage debt collector Ocwen Financial  ( OCN).   However, according to a compilation of data by Deal affiliate BoardEx, Ross still sits on at least five public company boards: ArcelorMittal  ( MT), the world largest steel company, the Bank of Cypress, Exco Resources  ( XCO), Sun National Bank ( SNBC) and a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, for WL Ross Holding  ( WLRHU)     At the same time he is executive director or supervisory director at privately held Diamond Shipping, a tanker company where WL Ross is a major stakeholder and he holds the non-executive chairman position.     On top of that, Ross is a member of the investment committee for Asia-focused activist investor The Taiyo Fund LP, a joint venture between WL Ross, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and a team investing in Japan. He also is a trustee at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, the Palm Beach Civic Association, and the board of the Yale School of Management, where he studied, as well as several other other non-profits. In all, BoardEx reports that Ross serves roughly 17 boards, committees and clubs, a number that is substantial though significantly down from a few years ago.   That's still too many, according to governance experts and restructuring specialists. Kurt S. Schulzke, director of law ethics and regulation at the Kennesaw State University Corporate Governance Center, said there is no question that Ross is over-boarded. "There is plenty of data out there to support the notion that for a top executive to sit on more than two or three boards is excessive," Schulzke said. "There is no way one can absorb, synthesize and analyze the company when you are sitting on so many boards."     Ross defends his directorships, telling The Deal that all the for-profit boards he sits on represent present or former portfolio companies. He added that participating on boards and influencing the direction of companies is an important component of the business model for WL Ross & Co., the private equity firm he founded in 2000. "In some particularly active situations I might be on the phone or in physical meetings with management several times a week," Ross told The Deal. "We also interact informally with managements between meetings."   Invesco  ( IVZ), a money manager based in Atlanta acquired WL Ross in 2006. Ross stepped down from day-to-day management of WL Ross & Co. last year and is currently chairman and Chief Strategy Officer, clearly still a top position at the firm. The buyout shop has two senior managing directors that are co-leaders of the firm , which no longer employs the CEO title.   "Now that I am less involved in the day to day affairs of the [WL Ross] business I have even more time available," Ross said.   Ross suggested that there is a big difference between a top executive of a public company sitting on a number of other boards and his situation, where WL Ross owns stakes in public and private companies. "We are major stakeholders in companies and are active, not passive managers," Ross said. "An executive from a non-private equity firm would not have as much time to devote to boards as I do because for such a person an outside directorship is just a side line."  Being on multiple boards, Ross added, exposes individuals to a wide range of management practices and relationships between board and management. "You can perhaps imagine the breadth of experience that serving on so many and such diverse boards enables me to bring to portfolio companies," he said.   However, governance experts said they don't buy that "richer knowledge base" justification for multiple board seats. Schulzke acknowledges that many individuals who have multiple directorships make the argument that being a director at so many companies allows them to work from a broader grasp of the markets and corporations in general. He argues that the individual still has to physically spend the time to understand and provide adequate oversight to each of the companies. "Unless you have a deal with Dr. Who to let you travel back in time it is a mystery to me how someone can serve on five or six or seven public company boards and do their job effectively," Schulzke said.

Confirmation Hearing for Wilbur Ross


Wilbur L. Ross, Donald Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, told a Senate committee, "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade."

                    By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor who is President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice to become commerce secretary, vowed on Wednesday to make sweeping changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement his top priority as the incoming administration moves to overhaul its commercial partnerships around the world.Mr. Trump made Nafta one of his favorite targets of derision during the presidential campaign, using it to blame Democrats for the loss of millions of industrial jobs. At his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Ross made it clear that the United States’ northern and southern neighbors should prepare to renegotiate a pact that for decades has eased the flow of commerce among the countries. He said “all aspects” of the agreement were on the table.“As to Canada and Mexico, the president-elect has made no secret in his public remarks, nor have I, that Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with,” said Mr. Ross, who will take a leading role in executing Mr. Trump’s trade agenda. “We ought to solidify relationships the best way we can in our own territory before we go off into other jurisdictions.”Next on his list could be China, Mr. Ross suggested, as he assailed the country’s high tariffs and what he described as empty claims of embracing free trade. Mr. Ross said he wanted to bring “the reality closer to the rhetoric” when it comes to China.

“China is the most protectionist country of the very large countries,” he said. “They talk more about free trade than they actually practice.” Continue reading the main story

But in spite of his promises to crack down on countries that are cheating on trade, Mr. Ross also tried to assuage concerns that Mr. Trump’s “America First” philosophy will lead to protectionism and, potentially, economic disaster.“I am not anti-trade,” Mr. Ross insisted. “I am pro-trade. But I am pro-sensible trade.”As for the tariffs that Mr. Trump has called for imposing on some imports, Mr. Ross said he had learned the lessons of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised import taxes on thousands of goods in the 1930s and is widely believed to have extended the Great Depression.The act “didn’t work very well then, and it very likely wouldn’t work now,” Mr. Ross said.Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said he was worried that some of Mr. Trump’s more provocative ideas, like a 35 percent tax on companies that sell products in the United States but manufacture them elsewhere, could be a drag on economic growth.Mr. Ross suggested that Mr. Trump, a fellow deal maker, was simply being a shrewd negotiator.“I think the president-elect has done a wonderful job preconditioning some of the other countries with whom we will be negotiating that change is coming,” Mr. Ross said.Mr. Trump has faced criticism for packing his economic team with rich patrons of Wall Street after running a populist campaign focused on lifting the middle class. Known in some circles as the “king of bankruptcy,” Mr. Ross, 79, made his fortune as a private equity titan who bought and sold the kinds of struggling industrial companies that Mr. Trump has promised to revive, often cutting jobs in the process.

Although the hearing was largely cordial, Mr. Ross was heckled at one point by protesters who accused him of sending jobs offshore as a businessman. An analysis by Reuters this week found that companies controlled by Mr. Ross moved about 2,700 jobs to other countries since 2004 by relocating production from the United States. Mr. Ross on Wednesday defended his record as a job creator.However, Mr. Ross did have to let go one employee in recent weeks. In an unexpected revelation, he admitted he had unknowingly employed a household worker who might have been undocumented, a fact he said he discovered while preparing for his Senate confirmation process.Mr. Ross said the employee had presented a Social Security card and a valid driver’s license, both bearing that person’s name, when hired in 2009. But during a check over the past month, the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation and was fired immediately, Mr. Ross said.

“We did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment, and it turned out that was incorrect,” Mr. Ross said.Like many of Mr. Trump’s cabinet selections, Mr. Ross is facing scrutiny for a long business background that raises the potential for conflicts of interest. In a filing released this week, Mr. Ross indicated that he planned to divest at least 80 assets and investment funds and step down from dozens of funds and firms in which he has financial stakes.Some Democrats on the committee, like Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, expressed concern that conflicts of interest could be a problem for the administration because of Mr. Trump’s vast financial portfolio and his refusal to divest his holdings. Noting the financial sacrifice that Mr. Ross is making by becoming a public servant, Mr. Blumenthal asked if Mr. Trump should do the same for the sake of the country.Mr. Ross said that he was not fully aware of the breadth of Mr. Trump’s holdings but that he did know that presidents are held to different standards regarding conflicts of interest.“I think it is appropriate for him to judge,” Mr. Ross said.

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]

Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]

Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Wilbur Ross Quotes

American
-
Businessman

Born: November 28, 1937










































   Loading...






There is no evidence that more regulation makes things better. The most highly regulated industry in America is commercial banking, and that didn't save those institutions from making terrible decisions.
Wilbur Ross


Decisions,
America,
Better



















It's important to have a sound idea, but the really important thing is the implementation.
Wilbur Ross


Important,
Sound,
Idea
























My wife Hillary sometimes accuses me of trying to reinvent the 19th century. In some ways she's right because I like things that I can understand and that aren't too complicated.
Wilbur Ross


Wife,
Trying,
Me



















The one term I don't like to be called is a 'vulture.' Because to me, a vulture is a kind of asset-stripper that eats dead flesh off the bones of a dead creature. Our bird should be the phoenix, the bird that reinvents itself, recreates itself from its ashes. And that's much closer to what it is that we really do.
Wilbur Ross


Bird,
Me,
Kind



















I think it's natural for any manager to want to grow his business. The question is at what rate, and in what direction, and in what format?
Wilbur Ross


Business,
Direction,
Want



















I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with a bank being big. In fact, there are some good arguments about universality of geography that in theory, if you have all your eggs in one little community, and some big employer goes out, that could be your downfall.
Wilbur Ross


Good,
Community,
Think



















Banking, I would argue, is the most heavily regulated industry in the world. Regulations don't solve things. Supervision solves things.
Wilbur Ross


World,
Banking,
Most



















Shipping has a great oversupply of vessels that came from over-ordering a few years back. We think 2014 may be when it turns around.
Wilbur Ross


Great,
Think,
Back



















You cannot just keep borrowing more and more and keep spending more and more without eventually having a day of reckoning.
Wilbur Ross


Day,
You,
More
























Shale gas, if left to flourish, could create several hundred thousand more jobs.
Wilbur Ross


Create,
More,
Left



















I think at the end of the day, the real sick man of Europe is liable to turn out to be France, not Greece, not Portugal, not Spain, not Italy. The reason is France is very uncompetitive to begin with on a global scale, and the measures that Hollande has been putting in have been very, very negative from the point of view of economic growth.
Wilbur Ross


Growth,
Man,
Day



















Each weekend I play at least one and maybe two sets of tennis a day. My doubles team was in the finals recently at my tennis club in Palm Beach and lost a tiebreaker after a three-hour match. I must confess, by the end of the three hours, I was relieved it was over.
Wilbur Ross


Beach,
Team,
Day



















Ships are a strange kind of commodity because they're very lumpy, very big individual units, but they're commodities.
Wilbur Ross


Strange,
Kind,
Ships



















Everybody talks about tariffs as the first thing. Tariffs are the last thing. Tariffs are part of the negotiation. The real trick is going to be increase American exports. Get rid of some of the tariff and non-tariff barriers to American exports.
Wilbur Ross


American,
Negotiation,
Real



















The fact that you're successful doesn't mean that you can't relate to working people.
Wilbur Ross


Successful,
People,
Working
























I see myself as a private-equity investor that helps rebuild companies. Restructuring is a cottage industry in that there aren't that many serious practitioners.
Wilbur Ross


Myself,
See,
Serious



















Generally speaking, companies get into bankruptcy as a kind of meritocracy. Somebody made some sort of big mistake, to get into bankruptcy, and very often, a part of the mistake is too much leverage.

Mistake,
Kind,
Leverage

Strange



















The fundamentals are the U.S. is going to end up being a net exporter of natural gas. That's going to be wonderful to help our balance of payments, reduce our dependence on a lot of countries that aren't so crazy about us, and change many, many parts of what goes on here.
Wilbur Ross


Change,
Balance,
End

Government,

If you add up all the promises any politician makes, the math doesn't work. Hillary Clinton's math doesn't work; Donald's math probably doesn't work. I think you have to listen to their campaign pitches more as symbolic, more as metaphors.

Promises,
Think
