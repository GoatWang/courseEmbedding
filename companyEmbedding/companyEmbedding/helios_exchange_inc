The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

HELiOS-EEX takes advantage of City Energy Disclosure Regulations. Whenever energy use is disclosed, Helios has already identified energy retrofit opportunities and has created a business case in HELiOS-EEX. 
We have also anticipated cities and states that are in the process of implementing a disclosure program. Inaddition, large cities where PACE programs exist or where energy costs are very high have been added to the HELiOS-EEX.
This is our starting point. We are planning to extend our geographic coverage, including Canada. If you own or are working on a commercial property that is not currently in HELiOS-EEX, you can simply add it. We have no limit in terms of building size, type or location, as long as it is in the US. 
For specific requests, please contact us.




FINANCING SOLUTIONS
HELiOS provides a wide range of financing solutions, so that building 
owners can find the one that best suits their own situation and cash
position.
HELiOS financing products are designed to overcome the two highest 
barriers to energy retrofits, i.e. lack of budget and lack of confidence in the
 savings. HELiOS Financing products ensure that the projects are cash 
flow positive to the building owner from day one. We offer PACE financing,
 Efficiency Services Agreements, as well as more traditional loans and leases.
