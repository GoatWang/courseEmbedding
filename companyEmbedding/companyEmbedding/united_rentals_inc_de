Some of our indirect expenses include, but are not limited to, the handling and managing of wastewater disposal, oil and fuel spills, fuel storage and management, fees paid to regulatory agencies and fees paid to vendors. Some of our direct environmental expenses include proper disposal of products from the care, maintenance and operation of equipment including used oil filters, spent oil absorbent, parts cleaners, scrap tires and waste antifreeze. This is not a government-mandated charge.

Environmental
United Rentals applies an environmental charge to rented equipment that contains an internal combustion engine, hydraulic oils or similar components. The charge is 1.30% of the rental charge for equipment with a maximum charge of $75. The charge is designed to recover the company’s direct and indirect expenses for the handling, managing and disposing of waste products, hazardous materials and related administrative costs.
Some of our indirect expenses include, but are not limited to, the handling and managing of wastewater disposal, oil and fuel spills, fuel storage and management, fees paid to regulatory agencies and fees paid to vendors. Some of our direct environmental expenses include proper disposal of products from the care, maintenance and operation of equipment including used oil filters, spent oil absorbent, parts cleaners, scrap tires and waste antifreeze. This is not a government-mandated charge.

Rental Protection Plan
The Rental Protection Plan is not insurance. The Rental Protection Plan is optional and only available to direct commercial customers. When you purchase the Rental Protection Plan product, you will not be held responsible for the full replacement value of damaged or stolen equipment. If something does go wrong, you will be responsible for 10% of the damage costs or $500.00, whichever is less*.
Upon accepting the Rental Protection Plan, the customer agrees to pay a percentage based on the rented equipment, and in return United Rentals agrees to waive certain claims for accidental damage to or theft of the aforementioned equipment occurring during normal and careful use. The customer remains liable for all other damages as set forth in the conditions found in Addendum 1 to the Rental Agreement.
*Customer agrees that it will use its best efforts to protect the equipment from loss, theft or damage at all times during the rental period, and until the equipment is retrieved and in the Company’s possession.

Environmental
United Rentals applies an environmental charge to rented equipment that contains an internal combustion engine, hydraulic oils or similar components. The charge is 1.30% of the rental charge for equipment with a maximum charge of $75. The charge is designed to recover the company’s direct and indirect expenses for the handling, managing and disposing of waste products, hazardous materials and related administrative costs.
Some of our indirect expenses include, but are not limited to, the handling and managing of wastewater disposal, oil and fuel spills, fuel storage and management, fees paid to regulatory agencies and fees paid to vendors. Some of our direct environmental expenses include proper disposal of products from the care, maintenance and operation of equipment including used oil filters, spent oil absorbent, parts cleaners, scrap tires and waste antifreeze. This is not a government-mandated charge.

×



Rental Protection Plan
The Rental Protection Plan is not insurance. The Rental Protection Plan is optional and only available to direct commercial customers. When you purchase the Rental Protection Plan product, you will not be held responsible for the full replacement value of damaged or stolen equipment. If something does go wrong, you will be responsible for 10% of the damage costs or $500.00, whichever is less*.
Upon accepting the Rental Protection Plan, the customer agrees to pay a percentage based on the rented equipment, and in return United Rentals agrees to waive certain claims for accidental damage to or theft of the aforementioned equipment occurring during normal and careful use. The customer remains liable for all other damages as set forth in the conditions found in Addendum 1 to the Rental Agreement.
*Customer agrees that it will use its best efforts to protect the equipment from loss, theft or damage at all times during the rental period, and until the equipment is retrieved and in the Company’s possession.

Operations[edit]
United Rentals is primarily a provider of construction and industrial equipment: trucks, forklifts, earth movers, compressors, aerial work platforms, homeowner equipment, and similar devices. Together, these are considered general and aerial rentals, and they make up the bulk of URI's rental fleet and customer base.
The company also rents equipment in four specialty fields:[1]

Trench safety includes excavation in confined spaces, underground construction, and the training necessary to safely handle such equipment.
Power & HVAC includes temporary power generators and mobile climate control. These devices are often used during commercial renovations or in response to natural disasters.
Tool solutions involve renting out trailers stocked with tools and supplies. They are often used at large constructions sites or during refinery shutdowns.
Pump solutions include the devices and supplies necessary for transferring or removing liquids. They tend to have applications in mining and agriculture.

History[edit]




A Ford F-150 truck from United Rentals.


United Rentals was founded in September 1997.[3] Then-chairman and CEO Bradley Jacobs planned to grow the company through acquisition and consolidation, beginning in October 1997 with six small leasing companies scattered across North America.[4]
In December 1997, three months after forming, United Rentals began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol URI.[4]
In June 1998, it acquired U.S. Rentals, Inc., for a sum variously reported as $1.2 billion and $1.31 billion. The acquisition made United Rentals the largest equipment rental company in North America.[5]
On December 26, 2006, United Rentals announced the sale of their Highway Technology division to HTS Acquisition, Inc.[6]
On July 23, 2007, United Rentals announced a definitive agreement to sell itself to Cerberus Capital Management in a transaction valued at approximately $6.6 billion, including the assumption of approximately $2.6 billion in debt obligations. URI's board of directors approved the merger agreement and recommended that stockholders do the same.[7]
On November 15, 2007, the company announced that Cerberus was not prepared to proceed with the purchase on the terms set forth in its merger agreement. Cerberus confirmed that there had not been a material adverse change at United Rentals, which would have let it bow out of the deal without penalty.[8] On December 21, 2007, a Delaware Chancery Court ruling denied United Rentals' attempt to force Cerberus to follow through on the takeover bid. However, the court did order Cerberus to pay the $100 million termination fee stipulated in the original agreement.[9]
On December 16, 2011, United Rentals and RSC Holdings, Inc. announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which United Rentals would acquire RSC in a cash-and-stock transaction.[10] The merger was finalized on April 30, 2012,[11] boosting URI to what was at the time a 13 percent market share of the equipment rental industry.[12]
On March 9, 2014, the company announced plans to acquire National Pump for $780 million. This made United Rentals the second-largest pump rental company in North America.[13]
In June 2014, United Rentals was first listed on the Fortune 500. Based on its 2013 revenues of $4.955 billion, the company was ranked exactly 500th.[14] It had previously made it as high as 517 in 2002, before falling back down.[15]
On September 19, 2014, URI was added to the S&P 500 Index.[16]
On January 25, 2017, United Rentals announced the purchase of NES Rentals, a competing general equipment rentals company, for approximately $965 million.[17] It completed the acquisition on April 3, 2017.[18]

Together, these are considered general and aerial rentals, and they make up the bulk of URI's rental fleet and customer base.
The company also rents equipment in four specialty fields:[1]

Trench safety includes excavation in confined spaces, underground construction, and the training necessary to safely handle such equipment.
Power & HVAC includes temporary power generators and mobile climate control. These devices are often used during commercial renovations or in response to natural disasters.
Tool solutions involve renting out trailers stocked with tools and supplies. They are often used at large constructions sites or during refinery shutdowns.
Pump solutions include the devices and supplies necessary for transferring or removing liquids. They tend to have applications in mining and agriculture.

History[edit]




A Ford F-150 truck from United Rentals.


United Rentals was founded in September 1997.[3] Then-chairman and CEO Bradley Jacobs planned to grow the company through acquisition and consolidation, beginning in October 1997 with six small leasing companies scattered across North America.[4]
In December 1997, three months after forming, United Rentals began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol URI.[4]
In June 1998, it acquired U.S. Rentals, Inc., for a sum variously reported as $1.2 billion and $1.31 billion. The acquisition made United Rentals the largest equipment rental company in North America.[5]
On December 26, 2006, United Rentals announced the sale of their Highway Technology division to HTS Acquisition, Inc.[6]
On July 23, 2007, United Rentals announced a definitive agreement to sell itself to Cerberus Capital Management in a transaction valued at approximately $6.6 billion, including the assumption of approximately $2.6 billion in debt obligations. URI's board of directors approved the merger agreement and recommended that stockholders do the same.[7]
On November 15, 2007, the company announced that Cerberus was not prepared to proceed with the purchase on the terms set forth in its merger agreement. Cerberus confirmed that there had not been a material adverse change at United Rentals, which would have let it bow out of the deal without penalty.[8] On December 21, 2007, a Delaware Chancery Court ruling denied United Rentals' attempt to force Cerberus to follow through on the takeover bid. However, the court did order Cerberus to pay the $100 million termination fee stipulated in the original agreement.[9]
On December 16, 2011, United Rentals and RSC Holdings, Inc. announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which United Rentals would acquire RSC in a cash-and-stock transaction.[10] The merger was finalized on April 30, 2012,[11] boosting URI to what was at the time a 13 percent market share of the equipment rental industry.[12]
On March 9, 2014, the company announced plans to acquire National Pump for $780 million. This made United Rentals the second-largest pump rental company in North America.[13]
In June 2014, United Rentals was first listed on the Fortune 500. Based on its 2013 revenues of $4.955 billion, the company was ranked exactly 500th.[14] It had previously made it as high as 517 in 2002, before falling back down.[15]
On September 19, 2014, URI was added to the S&P 500 Index.[16]
On January 25, 2017, United Rentals announced the purchase of NES Rentals, a competing general equipment rentals company, for approximately $965 million.[17] It completed the acquisition on April 3, 2017.[18]

Environmental
United Rentals applies an environmental charge to rented equipment that contains an internal combustion engine, hydraulic oils or similar components. The charge is 1.30% of the rental charge for equipment with a maximum charge of $75. The charge is designed to recover the company’s direct and indirect expenses for the handling, managing and disposing of waste products, hazardous materials and related administrative costs.
Some of our indirect expenses include, but are not limited to, the handling and managing of wastewater disposal, oil and fuel spills, fuel storage and management, fees paid to regulatory agencies and fees paid to vendors. Some of our direct environmental expenses include proper disposal of products from the care, maintenance and operation of equipment including used oil filters, spent oil absorbent, parts cleaners, scrap tires and waste antifreeze. This is not a government-mandated charge.

×



Rental Protection Plan
The Rental Protection Plan is not insurance. The Rental Protection Plan is optional and only available to direct commercial customers. When you purchase the Rental Protection Plan product, you will not be held responsible for the full replacement value of damaged or stolen equipment. If something does go wrong, you will be responsible for 10% of the damage costs or $500.00, whichever is less*.
Upon accepting the Rental Protection Plan, the customer agrees to pay a percentage based on the rented equipment, and in return United Rentals agrees to waive certain claims for accidental damage to or theft of the aforementioned equipment occurring during normal and careful use. The customer remains liable for all other damages as set forth in the conditions found in Addendum 1 to the Rental Agreement.
*Customer agrees that it will use its best efforts to protect the equipment from loss, theft or damage at all times during the rental period, and until the equipment is retrieved and in the Company’s possession.

Environmental
United Rentals applies an environmental charge to rented equipment that contains an internal combustion engine, hydraulic oils or similar components. The charge is 1.30% of the rental charge for equipment with a maximum charge of $75. The charge is designed to recover the company’s direct and indirect expenses for the handling, managing and disposing of waste products, hazardous materials and related administrative costs.
Some of our indirect expenses include, but are not limited to, the handling and managing of wastewater disposal, oil and fuel spills, fuel storage and management, fees paid to regulatory agencies and fees paid to vendors. Some of our direct environmental expenses include proper disposal of products from the care, maintenance and operation of equipment including used oil filters, spent oil absorbent, parts cleaners, scrap tires and waste antifreeze. This is not a government-mandated charge.

Rental Protection Plan
The Rental Protection Plan is not insurance. The Rental Protection Plan is optional and only available to direct commercial customers. When you purchase the Rental Protection Plan product, you will not be held responsible for the full replacement value of damaged or stolen equipment. If something does go wrong, you will be responsible for 10% of the damage costs or $500.00, whichever is less*.
Upon accepting the Rental Protection Plan, the customer agrees to pay a percentage based on the rented equipment, and in return United Rentals agrees to waive certain claims for accidental damage to or theft of the aforementioned equipment occurring during normal and careful use. The customer remains liable for all other damages as set forth in the conditions found in Addendum 1 to the Rental Agreement.
*Customer agrees that it will use its best efforts to protect the equipment from loss, theft or damage at all times during the rental period, and until the equipment is retrieved and in the Company’s possession.
