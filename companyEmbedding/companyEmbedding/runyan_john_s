Football career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Runyan was born in Flint, Michigan where his father was an employee of General Motors.[3]
Runyan continues to hold the Flint, Michigan Carman-Ainsworth Middle School shot put record with a 1988 heave of 50 feet 7 inches (15.42 m).[4] Runyan was a two-time Michigan High School Athletic Association state shotput champion for Carman-Ainsworth High School (1991 57 feet 6 inches (17.53 m); 1992 59 feet 5 inches (18.11 m)).[5] He was a 1992 Detroit News second team All-State basketball center.[6] He was recruited by Michigan State men's basketball, though he declined in order to play football. He chose to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he was an All-Big Ten Conference selection for the 1995 Wolverines.[7]
Professional[edit]
Houston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans[edit]
Runyan was drafted in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans). He played with the Houston Oilers in 1996 and became a starter in only the sixth game of his rookie season. He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998, and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 when the team made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.[8]
Philadelphia Eagles[edit]
Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000 as an unrestricted free agent. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time.[9] Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2002.
On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract.[10] He had visited with the New York Jets on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.[11]
In a Sports Illustrated magazine in October 2006, Runyan was ranked second on a list of the Dirtiest Players in the NFL.[12] Bills linebacker Shawne Merriman stated that Runyan "was one of the dirtiest players I've ever been against in my whole entire life. He was real good at being dirty".[13] Runyan did not deny the charges, criticizing the current game instead: "That's the way the game's supposed to be played. I think they’ve tried to change that over the years. It's turned into a basketball game out there."[13]
In a 2007 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Runyan instructed Eagles running back Brian Westbrook to take a knee at the one-yard line rather than score a touchdown with two minutes left in the game so that Dallas would not get the ball back. Westbrook followed Runyan's direction, the play worked, and Philadelphia won the game.[14]
A 2008 poll revealed that getting blocked by Runyan on a screen pass was one of the scariest things in the NFL.[15]
Runyan held the remarkable streak for an offensive lineman of having started 190 consecutive regular season games. This was the second longest streak among active NFL players in 2008. He has also started in all 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in during this streak.
On January 28, 2009, Runyan had microfacture surgery on his right knee.[16] In February 2009, Runyan's contract expired with the team. He worked out for the Eagles on September 10,[17] but did not sign a contract. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers, playing in five games before retiring.

Even though he now played for the Chargers, he maintained a home in Mount Laurel, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.[19] On March 7, 2010, the Ocean County Republicans endorsed Runyan.[20] On June 8, Runyan won the Republican nomination.[21] On November 2, 2010, Runyan defeated Adler 50%–47%. He is the fourth NFL player to be elected to Congress, after Jack Kemp, Steve Largent, and Heath Shuler.[22]
Runyan won the seat against Democratic incumbent John Adler for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. Libertarian nominee Russ Conger and Your Country Again nominee Lawrence J. Donahue were also running.

In June 2013, Runyan was one of the sponsors to pass an amendment to H.R. 2217, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014, which increased the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants, and the Assistance to Firefighter Grants (FIRE) by $2.5 million each.[27]
On November 6, 2013, Runyan announced he would not seek reelection in 2014.[1]

Football career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Runyan was born in Flint, Michigan where his father was an employee of General Motors.[3]
Runyan continues to hold the Flint, Michigan Carman-Ainsworth Middle School shot put record with a 1988 heave of 50 feet 7 inches (15.42 m).[4] Runyan was a two-time Michigan High School Athletic Association state shotput champion for Carman-Ainsworth High School (1991 57 feet 6 inches (17.53 m); 1992 59 feet 5 inches (18.11 m)).[5] He was a 1992 Detroit News second team All-State basketball center.[6] He was recruited by Michigan State men's basketball, though he declined in order to play football. He chose to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he was an All-Big Ten Conference selection for the 1995 Wolverines.[7]
Professional[edit]
Houston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans[edit]
Runyan was drafted in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans). He played with the Houston Oilers in 1996 and became a starter in only the sixth game of his rookie season. He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998, and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 when the team made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.[8]
Philadelphia Eagles[edit]
Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000 as an unrestricted free agent. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time.[9] Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2002.
On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract.[10] He had visited with the New York Jets on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.[11]
In a Sports Illustrated magazine in October 2006, Runyan was ranked second on a list of the Dirtiest Players in the NFL.[12] Bills linebacker Shawne Merriman stated that Runyan "was one of the dirtiest players I've ever been against in my whole entire life. He was real good at being dirty".[13] Runyan did not deny the charges, criticizing the current game instead: "That's the way the game's supposed to be played. I think they’ve tried to change that over the years. It's turned into a basketball game out there."[13]
In a 2007 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Runyan instructed Eagles running back Brian Westbrook to take a knee at the one-yard line rather than score a touchdown with two minutes left in the game so that Dallas would not get the ball back. Westbrook followed Runyan's direction, the play worked, and Philadelphia won the game.[14]
A 2008 poll revealed that getting blocked by Runyan on a screen pass was one of the scariest things in the NFL.[15]
Runyan held the remarkable streak for an offensive lineman of having started 190 consecutive regular season games. This was the second longest streak among active NFL players in 2008. He has also started in all 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in during this streak.
On January 28, 2009, Runyan had microfacture surgery on his right knee.[16] In February 2009, Runyan's contract expired with the team. He worked out for the Eagles on September 10,[17] but did not sign a contract. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers, playing in five games before retiring.
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2010 § District 3
In November 2009, published reports indicated Runyan was interested in running.[18] On November 24, 2009, Runyan announced his congressional bid. Even though he now played for the Chargers, he maintained a home in Mount Laurel, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.[19] On March 7, 2010, the Ocean County Republicans endorsed Runyan.[20] On June 8, Runyan won the Republican nomination.[21] On November 2, 2010, Runyan defeated Adler 50%–47%. He is the fourth NFL player to be elected to Congress, after Jack Kemp, Steve Largent, and Heath Shuler.[22]
Runyan won the seat against Democratic incumbent John Adler for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. Libertarian nominee Russ Conger and Your Country Again nominee Lawrence J. Donahue were also running.

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2012 § District 3
Runyan was re-elected, defeating attorney Shelley Adler, the widow of John Adler. Adler had defeated Jason Sansone for the Democratic nomination.[23] Runyan won 54% of the vote, to Adler's 45%.

2014

Runyan announced that he would not seek re-election, after expressing frustration with his fellow Republicans over the government shutdown.[24]
Tenure[edit]
As of June 2012, Runyan had sponsored 15 pieces of legislation.[25] He votes with his party 92% of the time. Key votes he supported include the payroll tax cut, the Balanced budget amendment, defunding of National Public Radio, and the Republican budget plan.[26]
In June 2013, Runyan was one of the sponsors to pass an amendment to H.R. 2217, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014, which increased the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants, and the Assistance to Firefighter Grants (FIRE) by $2.5 million each.[27]
On November 6, 2013, Runyan announced he would not seek reelection in 2014.[1]

Football career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Runyan was born in Flint, Michigan where his father was an employee of General Motors.[3]
Runyan continues to hold the Flint, Michigan Carman-Ainsworth Middle School shot put record with a 1988 heave of 50 feet 7 inches (15.42 m).[4] Runyan was a two-time Michigan High School Athletic Association state shotput champion for Carman-Ainsworth High School (1991 57 feet 6 inches (17.53 m); 1992 59 feet 5 inches (18.11 m)).[5] He was a 1992 Detroit News second team All-State basketball center.[6] He was recruited by Michigan State men's basketball, though he declined in order to play football. He chose to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he was an All-Big Ten Conference selection for the 1995 Wolverines.[7]
Professional[edit]
Houston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans[edit]
Runyan was drafted in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans). He played with the Houston Oilers in 1996 and became a starter in only the sixth game of his rookie season. He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998, and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 when the team made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.[8]
Philadelphia Eagles[edit]
Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000 as an unrestricted free agent. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time.[9] Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2002.
On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract.[10] He had visited with the New York Jets on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.[11]
In a Sports Illustrated magazine in October 2006, Runyan was ranked second on a list of the Dirtiest Players in the NFL.[12] Bills linebacker Shawne Merriman stated that Runyan "was one of the dirtiest players I've ever been against in my whole entire life. He was real good at being dirty".[13] Runyan did not deny the charges, criticizing the current game instead: "That's the way the game's supposed to be played. I think they’ve tried to change that over the years. It's turned into a basketball game out there."[13]
In a 2007 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Runyan instructed Eagles running back Brian Westbrook to take a knee at the one-yard line rather than score a touchdown with two minutes left in the game so that Dallas would not get the ball back. Westbrook followed Runyan's direction, the play worked, and Philadelphia won the game.[14]
A 2008 poll revealed that getting blocked by Runyan on a screen pass was one of the scariest things in the NFL.[15]
Runyan held the remarkable streak for an offensive lineman of having started 190 consecutive regular season games. This was the second longest streak among active NFL players in 2008. He has also started in all 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in during this streak.
On January 28, 2009, Runyan had microfacture surgery on his right knee.[16] In February 2009, Runyan's contract expired with the team. He worked out for the Eagles on September 10,[17] but did not sign a contract. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers, playing in five games before retiring.
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2010 § District 3
In November 2009, published reports indicated Runyan was interested in running.[18] On November 24, 2009, Runyan announced his congressional bid. Even though he now played for the Chargers, he maintained a home in Mount Laurel, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.[19] On March 7, 2010, the Ocean County Republicans endorsed Runyan.[20] On June 8, Runyan won the Republican nomination.[21] On November 2, 2010, Runyan defeated Adler 50%–47%. He is the fourth NFL player to be elected to Congress, after Jack Kemp, Steve Largent, and Heath Shuler.[22]
Runyan won the seat against Democratic incumbent John Adler for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. Libertarian nominee Russ Conger and Your Country Again nominee Lawrence J. Donahue were also running.

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2012 § District 3
Runyan was re-elected, defeating attorney Shelley Adler, the widow of John Adler. Adler had defeated Jason Sansone for the Democratic nomination.[23] Runyan won 54% of the vote, to Adler's 45%.

2014

Runyan announced that he would not seek re-election, after expressing frustration with his fellow Republicans over the government shutdown.[24]
Tenure[edit]
As of June 2012, Runyan had sponsored 15 pieces of legislation.[25] He votes with his party 92% of the time. Key votes he supported include the payroll tax cut, the Balanced budget amendment, defunding of National Public Radio, and the Republican budget plan.[26]
In June 2013, Runyan was one of the sponsors to pass an amendment to H.R. 2217, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014, which increased the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants, and the Assistance to Firefighter Grants (FIRE) by $2.5 million each.[27]
On November 6, 2013, Runyan announced he would not seek reelection in 2014.[1]
Sponsored legislation[edit]
The following is a partial list of bills specifically sponsored (introduced) by Rep. Runyan.

H.R. 1300 (long title: To amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to reauthorize the volunteer programs and community partnerships for the benefit of national wildlife refuges, and for other purposes) is a bill that was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.[28] The bill would "extend through FY2017 the authorization of appropriations for volunteer services for programs conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), community partnership projects for national wildlife refuges, and refuge education programs."[28]

He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998, and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 when the team made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.[8]
Philadelphia Eagles[edit]
Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000 as an unrestricted free agent. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time.[9] Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2002.
On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract.[10] He had visited with the New York Jets on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.[11]
In a Sports Illustrated magazine in October 2006, Runyan was ranked second on a list of the Dirtiest Players in the NFL.[12] Bills linebacker Shawne Merriman stated that Runyan "was one of the dirtiest players I've ever been against in my whole entire life. He was real good at being dirty".[13] Runyan did not deny the charges, criticizing the current game instead: "That's the way the game's supposed to be played. I think they’ve tried to change that over the years. It's turned into a basketball game out there."[13]
In a 2007 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Runyan instructed Eagles running back Brian Westbrook to take a knee at the one-yard line rather than score a touchdown with two minutes left in the game so that Dallas would not get the ball back. Westbrook followed Runyan's direction, the play worked, and Philadelphia won the game.[14]
A 2008 poll revealed that getting blocked by Runyan on a screen pass was one of the scariest things in the NFL.[15]
Runyan held the remarkable streak for an offensive lineman of having started 190 consecutive regular season games. This was the second longest streak among active NFL players in 2008. He has also started in all 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in during this streak.
On January 28, 2009, Runyan had microfacture surgery on his right knee.[16] In February 2009, Runyan's contract expired with the team. He worked out for the Eagles on September 10,[17] but did not sign a contract. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers, playing in five games before retiring.

Football career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Runyan was born in Flint, Michigan where his father was an employee of General Motors.[3]
Runyan continues to hold the Flint, Michigan Carman-Ainsworth Middle School shot put record with a 1988 heave of 50 feet 7 inches (15.42 m).[4] Runyan was a two-time Michigan High School Athletic Association state shotput champion for Carman-Ainsworth High School (1991 57 feet 6 inches (17.53 m); 1992 59 feet 5 inches (18.11 m)).[5] He was a 1992 Detroit News second team All-State basketball center.[6] He was recruited by Michigan State men's basketball, though he declined in order to play football. He chose to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he was an All-Big Ten Conference selection for the 1995 Wolverines.[7]
Professional[edit]
Houston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans[edit]
Runyan was drafted in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans). He played with the Houston Oilers in 1996 and became a starter in only the sixth game of his rookie season. He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998, and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 when the team made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.[8]

Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000 as an unrestricted free agent. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time.[9] Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2002.
On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract.[10] He had visited with the New York Jets on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.[11]

A History of Congressman Jon Runyan

Written by qmgftqxa on January 14th, 2016January 14th, 2016. Leave a comment 

The Story of a Football Player Turned Congressman
Jon Daniel Runyan was born on November 27, 1973 and is an American politician. Runyan was also the U.S. Representative from 2011 to 2015 for New Jersey’s 3rd congressional district right. Currently, Runyan is a member of the Republican Party. However, before entering into politics, he was a record-breaking American football offensive tackle in the National Football League. Runyan played there for fourteen seasons. He was also a participant in the 2003 Pro Bowl after the 2002 NFL season. Born in Flint, Michigan Runyan was the son of an employee of General Motors. He had shown extreme progress in sports.
Houston Oilers drafted Runyan in the 1996 NFL Draft and played in the team Philadelphia Eagles and San Diego Chargers later on. Runyan was also the only remaining active NFL player who had played for the Oilers. Runyan liked to play college football at Michigan. In 1995, he was an All-Big Ten Conference selection. Additionally, he had been an All-State (Michigan) selection in high school basketball and was also a two-time state champion shot putter.
Runyan was drafted in the fourth round of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers, which are now called the Tennessee Titans. He became a starter in only the sixth game of his rookie season after he joined the Houston Oilers in 1996, and he also moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998. As the Tennessee Titans, he finally played one year in the New jerseys in 1999 which was also when the team had qualified for the Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was in fact the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.
On February 14, 2000, Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract. He was kept as an unrestricted free agent. Due to the contract, he became the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at that point of time. The Pro Bowl selected Runyan in 2002.
The Eagles had announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team on March 24, 2006. This time the contract was for with a three years. A remarkable streak for an offensive lineman was held by Runyan. He had started 190 successive regular season games. Among active NFL players, this was the second longest streak in 2008. All 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in have also been started by him.
Runyan had a microfacture for which he had surgery on his right knee on January 28, 2009 and Runyan’s contract expired with the Eagles in February 2009. Although he worked out for the Eagles in September, but did not sign a contract. He was then signed by the San Diego Chargers and played in five games before finally retiring. In various published reports indicated that Runyan was interested in running and Runyan announced his congressional bid on November 24, 2009. Runyan defeated Adler on November 2, 2010 by 50%–47% and became the fourth NFL player after Jack Kemp, Steve Largent, and Heath Shuler to be elected to Congress.
Runyan also won the seat against John Adler, the Democratic incumbent for New Jersey’s 3rd congressional district. The next term, Runyan defeated attorney Shelley Adler and was re-elected. Adler had also defeated Jason Sansone and secured Democratic nomination. Adler’s had 45% of votes and Runyan had 54%.
After expressing frustration with his fellow Republicans, Runyan announced that he wouldn’t seek re-election, over the government shutdown.
Runyan financed 15 parts of legislation as of June 2012. 92% of the time, he votes alongside his party. He supported key votes which include the Balanced budget amendment, the payroll tax cut, defunding of National Public Radio, and the Republican budget plan.
Runyan was also one of the sponsors in June 2013 to pass an amendment to H.R. 2217. This was for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014 (source: MaidMarines). This increased the number of employees for the Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants, and the required help to Firefighter Grants (FIRE) by $2.5 million each.
However, Runyan announced not seeking re-election to Congress in 2014 on November 6, 2013. Runyan has three children with his wife, Loretta. The family resides in Mount Laurel. His son, Jon Runyan Jr., is a 2015 is also progressive in sports and is in commitment for the Michigan Wolverines football program. Runyan has taken a course in entrepreneurship.
