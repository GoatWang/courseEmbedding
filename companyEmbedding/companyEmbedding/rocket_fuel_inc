Rocket Fuel is an ad technology company based in Redwood City, California.[3] It was founded in 2008 by alumni of Yahoo!.[3]
Rocket Fuel completed an initial public offering in September 2013.[4] The initial stock offering was $29 per share and reached a high of $59.95 per share when the stock opened. The stock closed at $56.10 per share on opening day, giving the company a value of $942.5 million.[5] By February 24, 2015, the stock had dropped to $9.63, or 86 percent below its record high and 67 percent below its IPO price.[6]
Rocket Fuel acquired the New York-based ad tech company [x+1] in August 2014 for $230 million.[7][8][9]
In 2017, the company was acquired by Sizmek, a private ad tech company owned by Vector Capital; one outcome of this was a retreat from public company status back to being a private company.[2]

Rocket Fuel is an ad technology company based in Redwood City, California.[3] It was founded in 2008 by alumni of Yahoo!.[3]
Rocket Fuel completed an initial public offering in September 2013.[4] The initial stock offering was $29 per share and reached a high of $59.95 per share when the stock opened. The stock closed at $56.10 per share on opening day, giving the company a value of $942.5 million.[5] By February 24, 2015, the stock had dropped to $9.63, or 86 percent below its record high and 67 percent below its IPO price.[6]
Rocket Fuel acquired the New York-based ad tech company [x+1] in August 2014 for $230 million.[7][8][9]
In 2017, the company was acquired by Sizmek, a private ad tech company owned by Vector Capital; one outcome of this was a retreat from public company status back to being a private company.[2]

Rocket Fuel Inc. Key Developments

Rocket Fuel Provides Preliminary Unaudited Financial Guidance for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 and Second Half of 2017
Jul 18 17
Rocket Fuel provided preliminary unaudited financial guidance for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and second half of 2017. The company expects second quarter 2017 Spend to decline approximately 20% year over year to $95 million to $96 million. Net Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 is expected to decline approximately 36% year over year to $42 million to $43 million. An estimated Adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $3 million to $4 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared with a $4.2 million adjusted EBITDA profit in the second quarter of 2016. Rocket Fuel expects its ending second quarter cash position will be roughly flat with the first quarter of 2017 at $62 million to $63 million, and total debt and capital lease obligations will be approximately $83 million to $84 million.

Rocket Fuel expects the Spend, Net Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA trajectory noted above to continue during the second half of 2017 and, as a result, it expects its second half 2017 financial results will be materially below last year’s performance.


Rocket Fuel Launches New Anti-Malvertising Platform Leveraging the Power of AI and Google Cloud Vision API
May 10 17
Rocket Fuel announced a new solution to fight malvertising in the advertising ecosystem through a robust, multi-layered detection and prevention system. Rocket Fuel uses Google Cloud Vision API to detect and reject certain ad types that are prohibited, thus protecting consumers in an effort to ensure client campaigns are free of malicious ads. Rocket Fuel’s system applies artificial intelligence, big data, blacklists and multiple anti-malware tactics to heavily scrutinize ads. By leveraging Google Cloud Vision API, Rocket Fuel can further identify and prevent for advertisers a substantial number of ads that fail to render or click-through correctly, as well as protect consumers against malicious intent. This ultimately results in significant savings for brands and agencies, allowing them to provide a better consumer experience. Additional anti-malvertising capabilities on the Rocket Fuel platform include: Text Inspection: Activation of Google Translate to automatically translate copy in ads in 104 foreign languages to detect prohibited products and 'click-bait' ads; and Assisted Automation: If ads are free of malware, screening happens in milliseconds. When an ad is flagged as suspicious, it gets held for human review. Ads that require human review are then typically turned around in a matter of hours. DoubleClick Ad Exchange (AdX) maintains the standards for ad quality and requires that their partners submit clean ads to run on DoubleClick Ad Exchange inventory. Rocket Fuel initially built its platform to comply with DoubleClick Ad Exchange’s strict requirements. After seeing its success, the platform was rolled out to all of Rocket Fuel’s inventory partners, now representing more than half a billion impressions per day.

Why Rocket Fuel?
You can get to the future faster by using predictive marketing to anticipate consumer wants and needs. Rocket Fuel’s Predictive Marketing Platform, built on a foundation of AI, will enable you to:

Delight more people in more places: add predictive capabilities to your media across brand and direct response advertising
Transform complexity into performance: Rocket Fuel only gets better when faced with complex consumer journeys and large volumes of high-velocity data
Achieve real results: centralize and activate data from digital and real-life signals to create consumer experiences that drive business growth







How is Predictive Marketing Different?
Predictive marketing gives you the power to deliver personalized, always-on, always-relevant experience to the consumer. When you predict and create these magic moments, you’ll be rewarded with higher levels of engagement and higher ROI.
Download the PDF






Talk to real people instead of devices
Predictive organizations are customer-centric, not product- or device-centric. All transactions and devices tie back to a single identity by person or household.





Upgrade from static segments to modeled moments
Traditional marketing segments are rooted in historical data. Predictive businesses build models that include transactional moments for real-time accuracy and the power to anticipate and exceed customer expectations.





Use owned data for competitive differentiation
More and more, predictive brands use their first-party data to drive better marketing outcomes. They're doing this by unlocking latent insights from this proprietary data, and using these insights to increase innovation and improve decision making.





Enable brand moments throughout the consumer journey
Consumer journeys are becoming extremely complex, and predictive brands anticipate brand moments so they can be there when consumers want and need them most.





Evolve from data to decisions
Data management platforms must evolve into decision management platforms, with syndicated intelligence replacing syndicated data, thereby enabling one system's AI to talk to another system's AI.

Why Rocket Fuel?













A huge market opportunity.
Rocket Fuel’s Artificial Intelligence and Big Data systems help marketing clients leverage unimaginable amounts of data in real time to increase the ROI of their marketing dollars. We’re players in a $15billion market with no company owning more than 3%.






An engineering infrastructure that blows away the competition.
Our Artificial Intelligence completes over 36,000,000,000 decisions per second. We process 77,000,000,000 bid requests per day. Our Big Data is over 68 petabytes (1 petabyte = 1 quadrillion bytes). We have 465 Terabytes of RAM – 18x the RAM of the IBM computer Watson. We have 25 PHDs on staff leading our AI programs.






A dream-team of Executive Leaders.
Executives come from some of the most innovative, successful companies in the world including Oracle, Walmart, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, IBM, Blue Martini, and Electronic Arts. Our founders remain active in driving our business and rolling up their sleeves alongside our employees and our Board of Director’s reads like a “Who’s Who in Silicon Valley.”






A company consistently considered a “Best Place to Work.”
We’ve been recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work”  in New York, the Bay Area, and Chicago. We have lunches, snacks, happy hours, ergonomic desks, lounges, an awesome game room, and more. …and Flexible Time Off (and more!).






An exciting and rewarding future.
We’re already leading the market with our DSP offering and are continuing to strengthen our lead. We have also partnered with half of the major trading desks, and focused on bringing more partnerships to help agencies gain an edge on their competition. New clients are added daily – effectively building an additional revenue stream while increasing our traditional base.

Angie's List - Rocket Fuel

Success Story
Angie's List













“When it comes to acquiring new customers, Rocket Fuel is an industry leader and one of the best vendors we’ve worked with. Their ability to scale spend to 47x the original test while also staying within our CPA-goal range is beyond impressive.”


Pat Adams
Online Media Buyer
						Angie's List
					










Goal
Drive new-customer acquisitions


Challenge
Distinguishing itself from competitors, attracting new customers online


Product Used
Rocket Fuel for Direct Response












Advertiser
More than two million households across the United States use Angie’s List to find high-quality service professionals and healthcare companies in over 700 categories. It was first inspired by Angie Hicks’ search for a reliable contractor on behalf of her former supervisor, venture capitalist William Oesterle. Hicks quickly realized there was an untapped need, and turned to Oesterle to raise money from investors in order to build the business. Fast-forward to the 21st century, and Angie’s List has become a booming business. It went public in 2011, and is traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ANGI. Angie’s List manages its advertising in-house, and because of repeated outstanding performance, uses Rocket Fuel for its digital needs.


Goal

Drive new customer acquisitions
Build brand awareness



Challenge

Attracting new customers in a crowded online marketplace
Distinguishing itself from competitors
Getting site visitors to convert



Results

Rocket Fuel scaled spend 47x from the test spend to the highest-spending month while staying within the CPA-goal range


Comparing the test month with the last month, Rocket Fuel achieved a 2.3x conversion rate


What does it take to scale your ad buying while maintaining optimal performance? It takes a platform that learns and adapts to all inputs it receives – Rocket Fuel AI. Over a six-month campaign in 2014, Angie’s List tested this concept by scaling its ad spend by 47x through Rocket Fuel’s platform. It is easy, even for the untrained eye, to see that a huge increase in impression volume (orange line) and ad spend (at the three month mark) had little effect on Angie’s List’s cumulative CPA (blue line). Rocket Fuel’s AI took the additional ad spend and optimally distributed it over the duration of the campaign in order to find the right consumers at the right time to drive conversions. And did it all at 47x its original scale.

Rocket Fuel | Predictive Marketing Platform

















































Search for:








Nav


























Rocket Fuel to be acquired by Sizmek
































Why Rocket Fuel?
You can get to the future faster by using predictive marketing to anticipate consumer wants and needs. Rocket Fuel’s Predictive Marketing Platform, built on a foundation of AI, will enable you to:

Delight more people in more places: add predictive capabilities to your media across brand and direct response advertising
Transform complexity into performance: Rocket Fuel only gets better when faced with complex consumer journeys and large volumes of high-velocity data
Achieve real results: centralize and activate data from digital and real-life signals to create consumer experiences that drive business growth







How is Predictive Marketing Different?
Predictive marketing gives you the power to deliver personalized, always-on, always-relevant experience to the consumer. When you predict and create these magic moments, you’ll be rewarded with higher levels of engagement and higher ROI.
Download the PDF






Talk to real people instead of devices
Predictive organizations are customer-centric, not product- or device-centric. All transactions and devices tie back to a single identity by person or household.





Upgrade from static segments to modeled moments
Traditional marketing segments are rooted in historical data. Predictive businesses build models that include transactional moments for real-time accuracy and the power to anticipate and exceed customer expectations.





Use owned data for competitive differentiation
More and more, predictive brands use their first-party data to drive better marketing outcomes. They're doing this by unlocking latent insights from this proprietary data, and using these insights to increase innovation and improve decision making.





Enable brand moments throughout the consumer journey
Consumer journeys are becoming extremely complex, and predictive brands anticipate brand moments so they can be there when consumers want and need them most.





Evolve from data to decisions
Data management platforms must evolve into decision management platforms, with syndicated intelligence replacing syndicated data, thereby enabling one system's AI to talk to another system's AI.
