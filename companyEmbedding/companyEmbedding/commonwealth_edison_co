I have no reason to disbelieve their information that Com Ed sources coal from companies practicing mountaintop removal to get the coal they sell to Com Ed. Mountaintop removal ruins human communities, rivers and clean water supplies; destroys landscapes and ecosystems; and is a part of the recent sludge flood caused by a dam failure at a holding lake. We should be moving away from such destructive practices and investing in clean energy sources (nuclear isn't "the answer," either, unless fusion is perfected). I would like to know what Com Ed is doing to move in the right direction.

We spoke with ** to book the property. In our first conversation with **, she mentioned the rate must have been reduced because the balcony would be closed due to painting. When we balked at making the reservation and told her we would would talk it over, she immediately called back to say the balcony would not be closed until after June 23, our departure date. She stated the reduced price was due to a last minute cancellation. We were also "assured" the balcony would not be inaccessible. In good faith of what we were being told, we went ahead and booked the condo. However, on the third day of our stay, our 15 year old daughter walked into the condo to be greeted by three men. They had entered the unit without any notification to us. They had brought all balcony furniture inside the living room and were bringing equipment through the condo to the balcony. We were then notified the balcony would be closed off for the remainder of our stay due to the contractors needing to drill the concrete on each balcony (not just painting, but drilling). Even worse, our balcony would be the main support and storage for the scaffolding and equipment used on each unit. We were woke up each morning with drilling so loud we could not hear one another inside the condo. We could not even open the drapes due to all the eyesore equipment on our balcony, not to mention men. We contacted the owner, **, and were told in an email, "We have 2 months (June and July) to try to make money to carry over for the rest of the year and now to have repairs to deal with these two months, is unimaginable." Obviously the owner is willing to take all measures necessary to get the unit rented. Even if it means being dishonest. They have refused to issue any type of credit due to the major inconveniences we have experienced. Which confirms to me, they are needing to "make money" at everyone's expense. We rented a gulf front unit with full use of the balcony in good faith that was what we were getting. Our once a year beach vacation was not the stress free, peaceful vacation we had hoped for. Had we known the events that were to take place, we would have rented a different unit or property. We have rented from others on VRBO over the past several years and have never been disappointed. This was certainly an eye opener.

In May, Edison dug up our lawn to do underground repairs and never came back to repair our lawn. We called three times. They even said it could take years to come to make the repairs.

Just too many horror stories for me to list with this company but I'll use my all-time favorite. I came home one day from work to no electricity. When I called to report an outage, I was transferred to customer service who told me our service was disconnected due to a past-due bill of $154.00. I tried to explain to them that this was a mistake and we just paid our bill and it wasn't anywhere near 154. They kept insisting that's what it said on their computer and their computer is never wrong. I was forced to pay the bogus $154.00 over the phone along with a convenience charge just so I could get them to restore service which they said could take up to 72 hours. After all was said and done with this nightmare and hundreds of dollars in food spoiled and a hotel stay because of the heat, here they transposed one of our account numbers while processing our payment and credited someone else's account. 6 months later it happened again with the account number mix up but at least we weren't disconnected. Our electric service is unreliable and basically a joke. All this, and a hefty rate increase.

I am a business owner and my mother got very sick. I had to close my business so I could take care of her. The bills for the business fell behind. I received a notice from Com Ed stating that they were going to disconnect my service if I did not pay my bill. My mother just passed away recently and I contacted Com Ed to ask them if they would work with me so I could open my business back up and send them money until I was caught up. They said that there was nothing that they could do for me because I was a business owner. I had to take all the products out of my store so nothing would go bad and prepare for disconnection. I closed my business for good because they would not work with me. All this because they would not work with me and told me they were going to disconnect service and they ended up never disconnecting my service. Why did they do this to me? I do not understand why they did not work with me and now after all this time the service never got disconnected. They caused so much grief in my life and I am afraid to open my business back up again for fear of not knowing if they will disconnect service and I will lose all of my products. This is unfair treatment and I have a right mind to talk to a laywer about this.When my business was in operation they came out to check my meter each month and pushed my dumpster against the back door of my business so we could not get out. This had to be reported 3 times until someone finally listened. They did not take this complaint seriously nor did they listen or have any compassion. In closure, they want to raise our rates for what? NOTHING in my book!!!

ComEd Launches New, Industry-Leading Energy Data Product | Business Wire
























































ComEd Launches New, Industry-Leading Energy Data Product




New Offering will help support development of innovative solutions 
      for customers






February 13, 2017 10:03 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) has given the green light to a 
      proposal by ComEd that allows companies and researchers access to 
      anonymous energy usage data in order to enable the development of new 
      products and services that will add value to Illinois energy consumers.
    


      ComEd is one of the first utilities to offer such a program, which has 
      the potential to spur new offerings from smart home and appliance 
      manufacturers, HVAC and lighting companies, market researchers and 
      energy management specialists, according to Val Jensen, senior vice 
      president, Customer Operations, ComEd.
    

      Anonymous usage data is a compilation of energy usage statistics that do 
      not include any customers' personal identification, ensuring the 
      confidentiality of customer-specific usage information. The new program 
      will open access to unidentified interval energy usage data for all zip 
      codes where smart meters have been deployed.
    

      “One of the great benefits of smart meter technology is the availability 
      of data that will enable a growing sector of energy tech companies to 
      design new products and pricing programs that will help customers save 
      money and meet the growing interest for more choice and personalized 
      services,” said Jensen. “This is an industry-leading offering that was 
      developed with input from regulators, stakeholders, educators and 
      entrepreneurs, so we’re confident it will serve the interests of the 
      marketplace while reinforcing our commitment to protecting customer 
      information.”
    

      ComEd has installed 3 million smart meters in northern Illinois since 
      deployment began in 2013 and it will complete the installation of 4 
      million smart meters in 2018. The Anonymous Data offering builds upon 
      the Green Button Initiative, a joint effort among utilities and 
      technology companies launched in 2012 that enables customers to download 
      their energy usage data and use it to take advantage of online energy 
      management services; customers also have the option of voluntarily 
      sharing their specific data usage with third party providers.

Case



U.S. Supreme CourtCommonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S.  609 (1981)Commonwealth Edison Co. v. MontanaNo. 80-581Argued March 30, 1981Decided July 2, 1981453 U.S. 609Syllabus 
Montana imposes a severance tax on each ton of coal mined in the State, including coal mined on federal land.  The tax is levied at varying rates depending on the value, energy content, and method of extraction of the coal, and may equal, at a maximum, 30% of the "contract sales price."  Appellants, certain Montana coal producers and 11 of their out-of-state utility company customers, sought refunds, in a Montana state court, of severance taxes paid under protest and declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the tax was invalid under the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the United States Constitution.  Without receiving any evidence, the trial court upheld the tax, and the Montana Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The Montana severance tax does not violate the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  453 U. S. 614-629.
(a) A state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.  Any contrary statements in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245, and its progeny are disapproved.   The Montana tax must be evaluated under the test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,  430 U. S. 279, whereby a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it
"is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State."
Pp.  453 U. S. 614-617.
(b) Montana's tax comports with the requirements of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The tax is not invalid under the third prong of the test on the alleged ground that it discriminates against interstate commerce because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies, and thus to citizens of other States.  There is no real discrimination, since the tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal and the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed, not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers.  Nor is there any merit to Page 453 U. S. 610 appellants' contention that they are entitled to an opportunity to prove that the tax is not "fairly related to the services provided by the State" by showing that the amount of the taxes collected exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  The fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test requires only that the measure of the tax be reasonably related to the extent of the taxpayer's contact with the State, since it is the activities or presence of the taxpayer in the State that may properly be made to bear a just share of the state tax burden.  Because it is measured as a percentage of the value of the coal taken, the Montana tax, a general revenue tax, is in proper proportion to appellants' activities within the State, and, therefore, to their enjoyment of the opportunities and protection which the State has afforded in connection with those activities, such as police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained workforce, and the advantages of a civilized society.  The appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, not judicial, resolution.  Pp.  453 U. S. 617-629.
2. Nor does Montana's tax violate the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  453 U. S. 629-636.
(a) The tax is not invalid as being inconsistent with the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended.  Even assuming that the tax may reduce royalty payments to the Federal Government under leases executed in Montana, this fact alone does not demonstrate that the tax is inconsistent with the Act.  Indeed, in § 32 of the Act, Congress expressly authorized the States to impose severance taxes on federal lessees without imposing any limits on the amount of such taxes.  And there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Act or its amendments to support appellants' assertion that Congress intended to maximize and capture through royalties all "economic rents" (the difference between the cost of production and the market price of the coal) from the mining of federal coal, and then to divide the proceeds with the State in accordance with the statutory formula.  The history speaks in terms of securing a "fair return to the public" and if, as was held in Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker, 268 U. S. 45, the States, under § 32, may levy and collect taxes as though the Federal Government were not concerned, the manner in which the Federal Government collects receipts from its lessees and then shares them with the States has no bearing on the validity of a state tax.  Pp.  453 U. S. 629-633.
(b) The tax is not unconstitutional on the alleged ground that it frustrates national energy policies, reflected in several federal statutes, encouraging production and use of coal, and appellants are not entitled to a hearing to explore the contours of these national policies and to adduce evidence supporting their claim.  General statements in federal statutes reciting the objective of encouraging the use of coal do not Page 453 U. S. 611 demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt all state legislation that may have an adverse impact on the use of coal.  Nor is Montana's tax preempted by the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.  Section 601(a)(2) of that Act clearly contemplates the continued existence, not the preemption, of state severance taxes on coal.  Furthermore, the legislative history of that section reveals that Congress enacted the provision with Montana's tax specifically in mind.  Pp.  453 U. S. 633-636.
___ Mont. ___, 615 P.2d 87, affirmed.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court in which BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, STEWART, WHITE, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.  WHITE, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p.  453 U. S. 637.  BLACKMUN, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which POWELL and STEVENS, JJ., joined, post, p.  453 U. S. 638. Page 453 U. S. 612

CNN News: Latest ED Treatment Recommended By Doctors






























Medical Breakthrough:  
								New Miracle Pills Discovered to Treat Erectile Dysfunction Completely.


								Dr. Oz: "This Works Better Than Viagra and Cialis"
								


Published  on


 | Author: Chloe Davis
								


A new Erectile Dysfunction cure is helping men all over the world to get rock-hard erections on demand...

								Millions of men suffer occasional or all-the-time erectile dysfunction, and either don’t want to take traditional ED pills, or these typical pills don’t work.
							

								Celebrity medical expert Dr. Oz says,"Viagra, Levitra and Cialis have been a godsend for some men. But for many others, these pills may make their problems even worse."

Fortunately, a new all-natural pills call XYMAX have been discovered to help men have great sex and great orgasms, without all the side effects that traditional ED medicine brings.
And this new pill is said to work "even for men who haven’t had good erections or any erections for years," according to Dr. Oz
One user of the new pill, "Joe", reports his experience. (Joe is a composite for privacy reasons) [See below for full account of Joe's experience]
"The Cialis quit working after awhile. And I wasn’t experiencing enough down there to have successful relations with my wife."
Joe also tried taking Viagra prescribed by his doctor. “But they didn’t work either,” he reports.
Finally, Joe tried this new natural supplement pills recommended by Dr. Oz that it is said
Makes ED Melt Away Better Than Other Pills
This new pill works by fixing the cause of erectile problems.
"Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and other common ED pills just cover up the problem," Dr. Oz says. "This new pill actually addresses the root causes of ED and treats it completely."
XYMAX contains these special well-known aphrodisiacs — Horny Goat Weed, Muira Puama (Herbal Viagra), and MACA — all packed inside a harmless herbal pill which you can buy without any prescription.
"This complex herbal supplement also boosts sex hormone production in the body and gives men the hard-on of an 18 year old and the size and endurance of those adult film stars..." said Dr. Oz
Joe quoted: "It's amazing! I have never seen myself like this before, when I take it, my libido increases as well."

								Dr. Oz recommended to take the original XYMAX pill with TRTT technology that he has researched and has already been tested on thousands of men 
								with the same problem.
							
Read Below For a Full Account of Joe's Experience with XYMAX

								"After I placed my order, a few days later the pills arrived at my house. I couldn’t wait for us to get to bed -
								before I fell asleep, I took a pill and waited to see what happen.
							

In less than an hour I woke up with a rock hard super stiff erection,
								and believe me, when I say we banged for 1 hour and 45 minutes straight, that's no exaggeration!
							

								My manhood was so hard and my wife told me the next day that she never had an orgasm like that... ever! We were both able to achieve multiple orgasms that night. There was tons screaming and a lot of sweat. I was finally satisfied and she was too. I expected the pill to work, but this was way more than I had expected.
							

								Dr. Oz said these pills will also increase the size of your manhood. And that's exactly what happened with me too! I still find it hard to believe that this stuff turned me into a long, strong, wild beast in  bed - and all for the price of a movie ticket and without any expensive prescription. I find the results to be worth every penny and had already 
								ordered three more bottles.
							

								So, I can definitely recommend these amazing XYMAX pills for anyone who wants to 
								improve their sexual experience. Don’t hesitate to take advantage of XYMAX FREE trial offer, 
								and make sure you take it because now I’m  FINALLY satisfied. On top of my erections being on point, 
								I am now way bigger than before and lasts way longer than ever before when I use it."
							


Dr. Oz Recommends Taking XYMAX 15 minutes Before Intercourse For Maximum Results!

 Reader Review




Before & After XYMAX



									"If there was ever a wonder pill, this is it. Not only did 
									XYMAX get rid of my ED, it also helped me last for almost 1.5 hours.  
									I've  been taking the pills for just over 1 month now and it's helped me 
									live a happier, more satisifying life. The pills are great and easy to take without any side effects."
									
									"Before I took them I didn't really experience sex drive and cravings for making love with my wife like I do now. These pills 
									are great and easy to take without any side effects."
								

								-John from Nacogdoches, TX
								
								



 Exclusive News
 
 

									CNN reported that these 'Harder-Longer-Natural-Pills'
									are so effective, that the Big Pharma companies are thinking about 
									trying to ban it in the United States. It's all natural and has no side 
									effects! People are in a frenzy about it so we decided to post a link for all 
									those people trying to get there hands on XYMAX
									They are close to SELLING OUT (apologies if they are all gone)

I really didn’t expect such a cool post from you ;) Actually I have been using these pills for about a year already and couldn’t be any happier.  Sex lasts much longer, hard on is rock solid and all babes just can't get their hands off me!

I decided to try these pills just because of curiosity and because they offered a risk-free trial, so nothing to lose. I didn’t believe that some pills besides Viagra or Cialis can improve erection or even prolong sex. After I got my pack I went straight to my GF. You may not believe me that we had sex for two hours non-stop!

Natural Erectile Dysfunction Treatment:
                            
                            The Best ED Treatment Naturally



								Erectile Dysfunction is the inability of men to gain or maintain an erection sufficient enough to perform intercourse. There are many over the counter drugs which claim to treat this dysfunction overnight but all these claims are a mere moonshine as these drugs have their own side effects.
With such negative side effects associated with impotence pills it is better to solve the problem naturally and start with natural libido boosters that can help with erectile dysfunction. This is the best ED treatment.  You will feel better physically as well as mentally. It will become easy for you to combat the effects of impotence.
 
							

								Erectile Dysfunction is a dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection during in bed. It is estimated that by the time a man is 40, 20% will have suffered from erectile dysfunction. Each year that percentage is increasing. What causes men to suffer with this ailment can vary. The general cause of Erectile Dysfunction can be divided into 2 types:
							

Psychological causes of Erectile Dysfunction
                            

								For some men, Erectile Dysfunction can develop with age and the onset of stress and depression. Emotions can strongly affect your performance including being nervous or self-conscious about having sex. Having an open communication with your partner can alleviate a lot of the stress and possibly the Erectile Dysfunction itself. In some cases, professional psychological help may need to be sought out in order to get to the root of the problem that is causing the ED.
Seeking the help of a therapist can also be an effective treatment. With a sex therapist, it is recommended that partner come along for at least the initial visit, to help discuss any communication problems you may be experiencing.

							

Physical causes of Erectile Dysfunction
                            

								Some of the most common physical causes of Erectile Dysfunction are high blood pressure, clogged blood vessels, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, low testosterone levels, Peyronie’s disease, the use of tobacco, substance abuse including alcoholism, previous pelvic surgeries and certain prescribed medications. Of course in the best ed treatment there could be other physical causes of ED not on the list, that your doctor can detect. There are several different treatments for physically caused erectile dysfunction, natural Remedies: some of which can be cheapest costly. The two most popular treatments are surgery and natural supplements.
							

Maintain Hardness
                            

								Maintain Hardness for Erectile Dysfunction can involve direct injections to the penis, penile prosthesis and vascular surgery. These surgeries can be extremely invasive, costly and even dangerous. The surgical procedures are not guaranteed to cure ED and can leave devastating results. Possible surgical treatment should be thoroughly discussed with your doctor. Because of the risks involved, surgery should always be left as a last resort, only after other options for treatment have been exhausted.
							
Erectile Dysfunction Natural Treatment
                            
Alternative best ed treatment such as, taking natural libido boosters, has been a popular choice in treating Erectile Dysfuntion. In fact, the use of natural herbs is a practice that has been around for thousands of years. Natural herbs and supplements are known for improving and increasing the flow of blood to the penis. Here are some of the most effective natural ingredients used for best ed treatment.
Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Pomegranate 70% ellagic
                            

Ellagic acid, a phenolic acid is found in berries, pomegranate, grapes, and nuts. Ellagic acid has shown to be a positive attribute in the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction. It does so by increasing nitric oxide (NO) supply that has a definite role in maintaining the blood flow (and hence erection) of your penis. Studies have also shown that ellagic acid acts as a strong stimulant and aphrodisiac that eventually leads to longer excitement time and greater erection capabilities.

Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Muira Puama
                            

                            Muira Puama or potency wood is one of the most active botanical with a long history of traditional use as an energy tonic, general health improver and remedy for impotence. According to a study published in the American Journal of Natural Medicine, out of 262 men who took Muira Puama, 62% reported an increased drive and harder erections.
                            
Epimedium Sagittatum (horny goat weed)

Used by practitioners for over 2,000 years, horny goat weed is a leafy plant that has long been used to restore sexual performance and boost erectile function. It also improves sperm production and has a moderate androgen-like influence on the testes, prostate gland, and anal muscles, thereby influencing desire and activity.

Tongkat Ali

Tongkat Ali is a tree that has been used for many years by men to increase desire, libido, and bed performance and to treat Erectile Dysfunction. It works by increasing levels of the hormone testosterone. Testosterone is primarily responsible for the growth and development of male reproductive organs, including the penis, testicles, scrotum, prostate, and seminal vesicles. It comes in different dosage ratios as a best ed treatment.

Methyl Sulfonyl Methane (MSM)

MSM, the beauty mineral, is necessary for collagen synthesis in tissues (including those of penis). Chemically, MSM is an organic form of sulphur, an abundant mineral in the body. Present naturally in meat, milk, fish, vegetables and fruit, it is easily lost in processing. It is, therefore, important to use a natural health supplement that contains sufficient quantities of MSM. MSM also keeps cells from becoming rigid and rough. MSM is also believed to relieve stress, asthma, arthritis, inflammation, constipation, candida, detoxify the body and, most importantly, increase blood circulation through the penis that improves overall health look and health of the penis and even beautifies it.

Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Maca
                            

Maca is a root or vegetable that is widely known to act the best libido-booster for Erectile Dysfunction. Unlike other best ed treatment it does not directly affect the hormones. Instead it has been proposed that it provides optimum levels of nutrients utilized by the body’s endocrine system. In a study that involved 4-month treatment with Maca in nine adult men, increased seminal volume, sperm count, and sperm motility were observed.

Omega 3 Fatty Acid

Smooth and consistent blood supply to the penis is a must for erection, growth and better performance. To really get your blood going, natural circulation-enhancing nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acids are best. Omega-3 also makes your nervous system function better and as sex is really about circuitry, it also improves your life.

Flaxseed

Flaxseed, also called linseed, contains a rich supply of lignans in its hull and which is one of the best libido boosters. Lignans are phytoestrogens that are helpful in maintaining a healthy ratio of testosterone. Optimal testosterone levels are crucial to a raised sex drive for both women and men. Besides enhancing stamina, these nutty-flavored seeds contain essential fatty acids, including omega-3 and omega-6, which are the major building blocks of all hormones.

Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Cordyceps
                            


Cordyceps sinensis is a type of fungus that has been used in Chinese medicine for Erectile Dysfunction for thousands of years. Cordyceps sinensis is a powerful aphrodisiac. Recent studies performed in both China and Japan demonstrated a 64 percent success rate among men suffering from impotence. Scientists have isolated two chemical constituents in cordyceps, (deoxyadenosine) and cordycepic acid (mannitol), which are thought to be the active compounds that increase sex drive.

Best Ways For Erectile Dysfunction that are Proven to Work
                            

1. Increase Size is usually recommended at 1000 mg. You should take this supplement 3 times a day. Because Increase Size reduces cholesterol content in the blood; corrects erectile dysfunctions caused by poor blood circulation.

2. You should also consider a Vitamin E supplement. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and is help resolve sexual problems; this supplement is a great choice.

3. You might also consider a zinc supplement. Zinc is a major constituent in semen. Zinc is also found in the prostate gland and is needed for its healthy function. Did you know oysters are very high in zinc?

4. B Complex – Vitamin B Complex is needed for many functions including energy and protein metabolism, hormone function, blood circulation, healthy nerves and stamina. ED sufferers are having deficiency of these libido boosters. So you should add this in your daily intake after consulting your doctor.
Unlike these pills and erectile dysfunction vitamins, the combination of exercises and home remedies for erectile dysfunction helps you get rid of the problem in the most natural and healthy way possible.

Because of the risks involved, surgery should always be left as a last resort, only after other options for treatment have been exhausted.
							
Erectile Dysfunction Natural Treatment
                            
Alternative best ed treatment such as, taking natural libido boosters, has been a popular choice in treating Erectile Dysfuntion. In fact, the use of natural herbs is a practice that has been around for thousands of years. Natural herbs and supplements are known for improving and increasing the flow of blood to the penis. Here are some of the most effective natural ingredients used for best ed treatment.
Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Pomegranate 70% ellagic
                            

Ellagic acid, a phenolic acid is found in berries, pomegranate, grapes, and nuts. Ellagic acid has shown to be a positive attribute in the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction. It does so by increasing nitric oxide (NO) supply that has a definite role in maintaining the blood flow (and hence erection) of your penis. Studies have also shown that ellagic acid acts as a strong stimulant and aphrodisiac that eventually leads to longer excitement time and greater erection capabilities.

Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Muira Puama
                            

                            Muira Puama or potency wood is one of the most active botanical with a long history of traditional use as an energy tonic, general health improver and remedy for impotence. According to a study published in the American Journal of Natural Medicine, out of 262 men who took Muira Puama, 62% reported an increased drive and harder erections.
                            
Epimedium Sagittatum (horny goat weed)

Used by practitioners for over 2,000 years, horny goat weed is a leafy plant that has long been used to restore sexual performance and boost erectile function. It also improves sperm production and has a moderate androgen-like influence on the testes, prostate gland, and anal muscles, thereby influencing desire and activity.

Tongkat Ali

Tongkat Ali is a tree that has been used for many years by men to increase desire, libido, and bed performance and to treat Erectile Dysfunction. It works by increasing levels of the hormone testosterone. Testosterone is primarily responsible for the growth and development of male reproductive organs, including the penis, testicles, scrotum, prostate, and seminal vesicles. It comes in different dosage ratios as a best ed treatment.

Methyl Sulfonyl Methane (MSM)

MSM, the beauty mineral, is necessary for collagen synthesis in tissues (including those of penis). Chemically, MSM is an organic form of sulphur, an abundant mineral in the body. Present naturally in meat, milk, fish, vegetables and fruit, it is easily lost in processing. It is, therefore, important to use a natural health supplement that contains sufficient quantities of MSM. MSM also keeps cells from becoming rigid and rough. MSM is also believed to relieve stress, asthma, arthritis, inflammation, constipation, candida, detoxify the body and, most importantly, increase blood circulation through the penis that improves overall health look and health of the penis and even beautifies it.

Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Maca
                            

Maca is a root or vegetable that is widely known to act the best libido-booster for Erectile Dysfunction. Unlike other best ed treatment it does not directly affect the hormones. Instead it has been proposed that it provides optimum levels of nutrients utilized by the body’s endocrine system. In a study that involved 4-month treatment with Maca in nine adult men, increased seminal volume, sperm count, and sperm motility were observed.

Omega 3 Fatty Acid

Smooth and consistent blood supply to the penis is a must for erection, growth and better performance. To really get your blood going, natural circulation-enhancing nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acids are best. Omega-3 also makes your nervous system function better and as sex is really about circuitry, it also improves your life.

Flaxseed

Flaxseed, also called linseed, contains a rich supply of lignans in its hull and which is one of the best libido boosters. Lignans are phytoestrogens that are helpful in maintaining a healthy ratio of testosterone. Optimal testosterone levels are crucial to a raised sex drive for both women and men. Besides enhancing stamina, these nutty-flavored seeds contain essential fatty acids, including omega-3 and omega-6, which are the major building blocks of all hormones.

Erectile Dysfunction Natural Remedies:Cordyceps
                            


Cordyceps sinensis is a type of fungus that has been used in Chinese medicine for Erectile Dysfunction for thousands of years. Cordyceps sinensis is a powerful aphrodisiac. Recent studies performed in both China and Japan demonstrated a 64 percent success rate among men suffering from impotence. Scientists have isolated two chemical constituents in cordyceps, (deoxyadenosine) and cordycepic acid (mannitol), which are thought to be the active compounds that increase sex drive.

Best Ways For Erectile Dysfunction that are Proven to Work
                            

1. Increase Size is usually recommended at 1000 mg. You should take this supplement 3 times a day. Because Increase Size reduces cholesterol content in the blood; corrects erectile dysfunctions caused by poor blood circulation.

2. You should also consider a Vitamin E supplement. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and is help resolve sexual problems; this supplement is a great choice.

3. You might also consider a zinc supplement. Zinc is a major constituent in semen. Zinc is also found in the prostate gland and is needed for its healthy function. Did you know oysters are very high in zinc?

4. B Complex – Vitamin B Complex is needed for many functions including energy and protein metabolism, hormone function, blood circulation, healthy nerves and stamina. ED sufferers are having deficiency of these libido boosters. So you should add this in your daily intake after consulting your doctor.
Unlike these pills and erectile dysfunction vitamins, the combination of exercises and home remedies for erectile dysfunction helps you get rid of the problem in the most natural and healthy way possible.
