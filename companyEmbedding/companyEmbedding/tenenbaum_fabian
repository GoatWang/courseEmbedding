Anterios Hires Fabian Tenenbaum As Chief Financial Officer And Chief Business Officer  











Tweet








11/17/2014 3:25:28 PM


NEW YORK, Nov. 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Anterios, Inc., a privately held medical dermatology and aesthetic medicine biopharmaceutical company, announced today that it has hired Fabian Tenenbaum to serve as its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Business Officer.  Mr. Tenenbaum brings a diverse skill set to the position, including both deep financial management expertise, as well as executive management and business development skills in the medical aesthetic and consumer healthcare arenas.  "We're thrilled to expand the operational and strategic capabilities of the management team with the addition of Mr. Tenenbaum, "commented CEO and Founder of Anterios, Inc., Dr. Jon Edelson.  "Mr. Tenenbaum's range of experience will be valuable as we grow the company both through advancing the development of our topical botulinum product candidate ANT-1207 for the indications of hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), acne and facial wrinkles and advancing our next generation injectable botulinum product candidate AI-09."Prior to joining Anterios, Mr. Tenenbaum was the CEO of Iluminage Beauty, a Unilever joint-venture company, which develops and sells energy-based aesthetic medical devices. From 2011 to 2013, he co-founded and then served as CEO of Syneron Beauty until the company was spun-off to Unilever. From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Tenenbaum was Executive Vice President and CFO for Syneron-Candela, a leading global aesthetic medical device company, where he oversaw financial management and investor relations, M&A strategy, global commercial initiatives and partnerships, and its international subsidiaries. Prior to Syneron, Mr. Tenenbaum held executive leadership positions with several life-science companies including Radiancy and Sunlight Medical. He also served on the Board of Directors for Rakuto Bio Technologies Ltd. and Fluorinex Active Ltd. Mr. Tenenbaum holds an MBA (as a Dean's List honoree) from Columbia University and a Bachelor in Medicine (summa cum laude) from the Faculty of Medicine at Ben Gurion University.  Mr. Tenenbaum assumed his role at Anterios, Inc. this month. About ANT-1207ANT-1207, Botulinum Toxin Type A, Topical Lotion, is an investigational product based on our proprietary NDS technology, being developed for the treatment of hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), facial wrinkles and other FDA-approved clinical indications for injectable botulinum as well as new potential clinical indications such as acne. The Company believes that this treatment has the potential to greatly expand the market for botulinum as it would overcome the limitations of injection, which include pain, bleeding and bruising as well as the potential for needle misplacement. ANT-1207 is a lotion that takes approximately ten minutes to apply in the physician's office using just a gloved finger. Unlike many botulinum-based products, ANT-1207 does not require reconstitution in the physician's office prior to use, making it convenient and time-saving for the physician and the physician's staff. ANT-1207 incorporates a highly purified botulinum developed from Anterios' proprietary cell line of C. botulinum, Type A.  About AI-09AI-09 is a novel injectable formulation of Botulinum Toxin Type A that is packaged as a ready-to-use liquid preparation. AI-09 is a complementary product candidate to our topical botulinum product candidate ANT-1207, particularly for therapeutic indications where deeper delivery of botulinum is required. AI-09 utilizes our proprietary NDS technology, which when applied to injectable formulations, addresses several of the pharmaceutical issues with currently available injectable botulinum products. Currently, all injectable botulinum toxin type A products on the market must be reconstituted in the physician's office prior to use because they are lyophilized, or freeze-dried.  They also contain human albumin. AI-09 utilizes neither lyophilization nor human albumin. These enhancements produce an easier to use and more convenient product for the physician, and eliminate the risk of transmittable diseases that is associated with the inclusion of human albumin in currently marketed injectable formulations of botulinum. AI-09 incorporates the same highly purified botulinum used in ANT-1207. AI-09 is in preclinical testing. About Anterios, Inc. Anterios, Inc. ("Anterios") is a privately held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing next generation botulinum-based prescription products for medical dermatology and aesthetic medicine. Anterios has developed the proprietary NDS platform technology that enables local, targeted delivery of botulinum toxin and other macromolecules across the skin without needles or other invasive treatments that can be destructive to the skin. NDS also enables the formulation of macromolecules as ready-to-use liquid injectable products. In the future, Anterios plans to develop additional dermatology products to topically deliver active ingredients other than botulinum, as well as formulate additional injectable products that require deeper delivery.

Forward-looking StatementsAny statements in this press release about Bellerophon’s future expectations, plans and prospects, including statements about the clinical development of its product candidates, regulatory actions with respect to the Company’s clinical trials and expectations regarding the sufficiency of the Company’s cash balance to fund clinical trials, operating expenses and capital expenditures, and other statements containing the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “would,” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: the uncertainties inherent in the initiation of future clinical trials, availability and timing of data from ongoing and future clinical trials and the results of such trials, whether preliminary or interim results from a clinical trial will be predictive of the final results of that trial or whether results of early clinical trials will be indicative of the results of later clinical trials, expectations for regulatory approvals, the FDA’s substantial discretion in the approval process, availability of funding sufficient for our foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, any forward-looking statements included in this press release represent Bellerophon’s views only as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s views as of any subsequent date.
