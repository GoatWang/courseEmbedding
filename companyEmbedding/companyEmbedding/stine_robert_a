I have a passion for helping others and am very grateful to have the opportunity to do so on a daily basis. I am involved with local organizations such as the Creek Church in Fort Worth and Heart of Texas Tres Dias. Being involved in my community is incredibly important to me. 
I’ve lived in the Fort Worth area for many years and enjoy being an Allstate agent in this community because of the individualism and true uniqueness of the town. I believe that this area is the best place to raise my family and spend my free time with my wife and kids. I also take pride in being a first generation American, as my family is from Germany.

In addition to comparing prices, it's important to compare the coverages that would be provided by each policy.

Teaching 

Past CoursesSTAT102 - INTRO BUSINESS STAT           Continuation of STAT 101. A thorough treatment of multiple regression, model selection, analysis of variance, linear logistic regression; introduction to time series. Business applications. STAT405 - STAT COMPUTING WITH R         The goal of this course is to introduce students to the R programming language and related eco-system. This course will provide a skill-set that is in demand in both the research and business environments. In addition, R is a platform that is used and required in other advanced classes taught at Wharton, so that this class will prepare students for these higher level classes and electives. STAT430 - PROBABILITY                   Discrete and continuous sample spaces and probability; random variables, distributions, independence; expectation and generating functions; Markov chains and recurrence theory. STAT510 - PROBABILITY                   Elements of matrix algebra. Discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions. Moments and moment generating functions. Joint distributions. Functions and transformations of random variables. Law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Point estimation: sufficiency, maximum likelihood, minimum variance. Confidence intervals. STAT511 - STATISTICAL INFERENCE         Graphical displays; one- and two-sample confidence intervals; one- and two-sample hypothesis tests; one- and two-way ANOVA; simple and multiple linear least-squares regression; nonlinear regression; variable selection; logistic regression; categorical data analysis; goodness-of-fit tests. A methodology course. STAT613 - REGR ANALYSIS FOR BUS         This course provides the fundamental methods of statistical analysis, the art and science if extracting information from data. The course will begin with a focus on the basic elements of exploratory data analysis, probability theory and statistical inference. With this as a foundation, it will proceed to explore the use of the key statistical methodology known as regression analysis for solving business problems, such as the prediction of future sales and the response of the market to price changes. The use of regression diagnostics and various graphical displays supplement the basic numerical summaries and provides insight into the validity of the models. Specific important topics covered include least squares estimation, residuals and outliers, tests and confidence intervals, correlation and autocorrelation, collinearity, and randomization. The presentation relies upon computer software for most of the needed calculations, and the resulting style focuses on construction of models, interpretation of results, and critical evaluation of assumptions. STAT621 - ACC REGRESSION ANALYSIS       STAT 621 is intended for students with recent, practical knowledge of the use of regression analysis in the context of business applications. This course covers the material of STAT 613, but omits the foundations to focus on regression modeling. The course reviews statistical hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for the sake of standardizing terminology and introducing software, and then moves into regression modeling. The pace presumes recent exposure to both the theory and practice of regression and will not be accommodating to students who have not seen or used these methods previously. The interpretation of regression models within the context of applications will be stressed, presuming knowledge of the underlying assumptions and derivations. The scope of regression modeling that is covered includes multiple regression analysis with categorical effects, regression diagnostic procedures, interactions, and time series structure. The presentation of the course relies on computer software that will be introduced in the initial lectures. STAT701 - MODERN DATA MINING            Modern Data Mining: Statistics or Data Science has been evolving rapidly to keep up with the modern world. While classical multiple regression and logistic regression technique continue to be the major tools we go beyond to include methods built on top of linear models such as LASSO and Ridge regression. Contemporary methods such as KNN (K nearest neighbor), Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analyses (PCA), the bootstrap and others are also covered. Text mining especially through PCA is another topic of the course. While learning all the techniques, we keep in mind that our goal is to tackle real problems. Not only do we go through a large collection of interesting, challenging real-life data sets but we also learn how to use the free, powerful software "R" in connection with each of the methods exposed in the class. STAT705 - STAT COMPUTING WITH R         The goal of this course is to introduce students to the R programming language and related eco-system. This course will provide a skill-set that is in demand in both the research and business environments. In addition, R is a platform that is used and required in other advanced classes taught at Wharton, so that this class will prepare students for these higher level classes and electives. STAT712 - DECISION MAKING               Fundamentals of modern decision analysis with emphasis on managerial decision making under uncertainty and risk. The basic topics of decision analysis are examined. These include payoffs and losses, utility and subjective probability, the value of information, Bayesian analysis, inference and decision making. Examples are presented to illustrate the ideas and methods. Some of these involve: choices among investment alternatives; marketing a new product; health care decisions; and costs, benefits, and sample size in surveys. STAT910 - FORCAS & TIME SER ANALY       Fourier analysis of data, stationary time series, properties of autoregressive moving average models and estimation of their parameters, spectral analysis, forecasting. Discussion of applications to problems in economics, engineering, physical science, and life science.
