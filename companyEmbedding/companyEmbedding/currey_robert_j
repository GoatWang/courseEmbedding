About Currey & Co.
Currey & Company is a wholesale manufacturer of distinctive home furnishings products. We are best known for our lighting products (chandeliers, wall sconces, table and floor lamps) as well as interior furniture, garden furniture and accessories. 
Headquarters for Currey & Company are in Atlanta, Georgia. This is the shipping point for customer orders also. 
The multi-cultural company work force in Atlanta creates, assembles, finishes, packs and ships product. A dedicated management team and an office force tend to details of accounting, order processing and customer service. 
Currey & Company sales representatives cover the United States and Canada. The corporate office handles international sales. Showrooms open to the trade are located in High Point, NC; Atlanta, GA; and Dallas, TX. 
All Currey & Company's lighting products are designed and engineered to meet the rigid safety standards established by UNDERWRITER'S LABORATORY and bear the UL/CUI label (E141302 or E163523). 
This UL/CLUI safety certification is valid in the United States and Canada. Currey & Company lighting products can also be manufactured to meet lighting standards around the world, including the European Union, Middle East and Asia. 
Currey & Company’s “vision” is to create and fulfill the desire for distinctive home furnishings. 
Currey & Company’s “mission” is to serve our customers, owners and employees in an exemplary manner through a culture, which encourages all to flourish. 
A Little Bit of History: Currey & Company, known today for its vibrant collection of lighting products, started its existence in 1988 as a purveyor of historic garden furnishings. When Robert B. Currey founded Garden Source Furnishings, the main focus of the company was the creation and marketing of classic garden furniture from the Winterthur Museum and the Smithsonian Institution.
These collections were joined by a very American collection of garden whimsies, birdhouses and rustic twig furniture. Some lighting products were among these first offerings and by the early 1990’s the lighting category had become very important. Accordingly, the name of the company was changed to Currey & Company to embrace a new focus on products for the interior. 
Chandeliers and wall sconces today form a significant part of the company’s business and these goods are characterized by the attention and detailing that goes into their manufacturing and finishing. With a workforce in Atlanta and Currey International in the Philippines, Currey & Company brings to the marketplace merchandise that not only speaks of the touch of the human hand, but also utilizes a myriad of natural materials. 
Hand forged iron products have long been the specialty of the company, but the range of materials has been extended to include a variety of materials such as hand-carved wood, porcelain and brass. “Currey International” has made it possible for the company to develop and produce a variety of unique hand made products and materials. One of these is concrete hand formed to create fashionable furnishings of “faux bois.” Seashells and other natural materials also figure strongly in the Currey & Company product line.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied. Did a status check to see where I sat with the promotion 80% at the spending goal and was told there was no promotion. So I closed all AMEX cards but this one and plan...show more

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

KingSize Credit Card


                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks. When you sign up it claims no annual fee, no monthly fees, etc. However now there is a minimum monthly payment even if you you have a zero balance. So I'm...show more

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            Grange Insurance added a 58% surcharge to our auto policy after a icy bridge weather related accident.  The increase totaled of $1042.00.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri

U.S. News & World Report
