Harry Potter-Inspired Potions Apothecary Cabinet


I have a confession to make. I'm 51-years-old and have just now discovered Harry Potter. I knew about the fandom insanity swirling around book and movie premiers, but I didn't pay much attention at the time. That was until last fall when I discovered how many credits I had on my Audible account. How about a book series? Harry Potter? M'kay, why not?  *poof*Damn you, J.K. Rowling! I'm hooked. I'm completely obsessed with the whole Potter world. I love the books and movies and can't wait to throw a Hogwarts party. I'm like a dog with a bone when I get obsessed about something immersing myself completely and love to use these inspirations in my creations.Part of the charm of the stories is how creative the fan base can be; it's a lot like Doctor Who in that respect. I love the crafts that have been inspired from all the HP stories and, of course, I want to try them all! I've started making wands (I'll post later) and because I've been wanting to do some altered bottles, a potions cabinet was a must to create.First, I had to find a shelf. Thrift shops usually have some sort of shallow, spice cabinet shelves hanging around, so I was off to Goodwill and found this:






This dusty old "bath" shelf fit the bill with its sturdy construction and great cubby storage for all those cool potions.










A quick coat of black acrylic paint and it's looking better already. The "bath" plaque had to be disguised, though.










A rummage through my workroom and I found the perfect brass stamping from B'Sue Boutiques. Large, Victorian and the perfect thing to cover the "bath" applique. I used black gilder's paste on the brass to bring out all the wonderful detail. I also had these Tim Holtz labels hanging around so I used those, too. If they look a little wonky it's not your eyes. The labels had this sort of channel looking thing sticking out the back and I needed them to be flush with the shelf. I ended up bending them out and using them as part of the design since the damn channels would NOT be cut off. It makes them look more "rustic", right?. Ahem.










Time to work on some bottles! If you do a search on Pinterest for "Harry Potter, Potion, Bottles, Labels, Free Printables", you'll squee with delight at the variety! I love them all and thought this set was so cool as it had some color and aging already done in the design. It does take some time to cut these out and you want to take care to leave off any white space around the labels.










Potion bottles coming together! I didn't take pictures of how I did this, but I used decoupage glue to labels to the bottles and covered the entire bottles with the glue. On some bottles, I painted on top of the glue once it dried to give texture and aging to the surface.










Again, do a Pinterest search for "cheap bottles" and you'll get some great results! Of course, the other option is to recycle old spice, vinegar and condiment bottles. I wanted some amber colored bottles, so I got my supplies from Specialty Bottle










I added some embellishments on the bottles, found some other fun stuff to use with the cabinet including a brass key, one of the wands I'm working on and an old moon and stars pin that has a great patina. Time to put it all together... looking pretty good, but it needs a back, I'm thinking!










Again, I didn't take pictures, but I did a measurement of the back, cut out cardboard, decoupaged the dictionary paper on the back and attached to the shelf. Snazzy!










So there you have it! An apothecary fit for Severus Snape! I did some final touches on the bottles, added caps, cracked marbles and more embellishments on some of the smaller bottles. I'm really pleased with how this turned out and I can't wait to use it for the party!










Brass stamping detail. I used black gilder's paste to bring out the awesome detail. You'll also see a peek of a wand I'm working on. This one is made from an oversized chopstick!










Some more detail on the bottles. Potter peeps will get the "R" on the Wolf's Bane bottle. Hee hee! Oh, and is that a painted, repurposed iPhone box? Why, yes it is! Look how fancy!










More bottle close ups. Happy accident on the "Polyjuice" bottle. The label when I was decoupaging had lifted the image leaving white. It was too big to leave, so I started coloring in with a black marker. The image started to look like a cat (which if you know the story about Hermione, you'll understand how cool that is!). I liked the metal "altered" tag, too. That's a Peruvian skull bead on the dried spider vial and a cracked marble on the truth serum. 










Before and After. Cooh, huh?



So there you have it. I hope you've enjoyed watching this transformation and think about doing one yourself! I would love to see your creations!Thanks for reading and leave me a comment and links to your work. x

Build A Line Challenge, B'Sue Boutiques 2016 - Part Two













Howdy, y'all!Welcome back! I've been busy playing with my two souvenir spoon lines. :)Last year, Route 66 was an idea that didn't materialize. This year, I've run with it! This line is all about color, fun, kitsch and humor. The main components are turning out to be souvenir spoon tops, vintage big letter postcards made from shrink plastic, colorful keys, colorful acrylic beads and Czech glass fruit beads. All, of course, bound together with some fabulous brass stampings from B'Sue. Check out some of the ideas and prototypes!






I'm not sure why, but I immediately thought of fruit jewelry as a natural compliment to this style. I've had a ball doing a bit of cage work to make these Czech glass beauties. What will they become? Not sure just yet. :)










I'm mirroring the style of the link bracelet I made last year. This eyecatcher has everything from a souvenir spoon, sweet heart, some cool retro-looking acrylic beads and even a compass!










A swingy pair of cherry earrings are always in style!










A necklace that screams fun!










Playing a bit with pattern, color and collage with this fun brooch.




My Steamer Trunk line is more of a redo from last year. Part of the changes I plan to make is to infuse a bit more color with the sepia toned pieces. I see deep aquas, mauves and pops of jet and pearls rounding out the look. Here's what's brewing so far...







The colors are making me happy with this batch. I see a lot of potential in this fun batch of components - most were made last year and stored away.










I did like this piece from last year and plan to replicate it.










I plan to make several charm bracelets with both lines. They are my absolute go to piece of jewelry. I have a dozen of them in different styles.










Hmmm... excited about this combo. I see a fabulous collage coming! Stay tuned!



Thanks for stopping by! When I have a bit more time, I'll post some more pics of my progression with these fun pieces. Make sure and go check out my fabulous fellow jewelry artists here:Brenda Sue Lansdowne Jewelry Making Outside the Boxhttp://www.bsueboutiques.typepad.comDiana Buynak Butterfly Emporium Ceramic Studiohttp://butterflyemporium.indiemade.com/blog Irene Hoffman, Heart's Dezire by Irenehttp://heartsdezirebyirene.wordpress.com  Clare Wells Nemeth, Creative Magickhttp://www.craftingmagick.blogspot.com Mary Reckmeyer, Afrayed Nothttp://www.afrayedknot.net Marcia Tuzzolino, Aurora Designshttp://auroradesignsjewelryblog.me Elizabeth Wilks, Wearable Art by Lizziehttp://wearableartbylizzie.blogspot.com Jeanette Rose Belmont, One Canvas At A Timehttp://www.onecanvasatatime.com Lyn Joy Reeve, A Journey From Jewels To Jubilationhttp://lnreeve00.blogspot.com Belinda Reed-Ingle, Vogue Rocks http://voguerocks.blogspot.com Beth Trubman, The Journey of Jewelryhttp://thejourneyofjewelry.blogspot.com Carole Carlson, Bead Sophisticatehttp://beadsophisticate.wordpress.com Jann Tague, Clever Designs by Jannhttp://janntague.wordpress.com Shari Gardner, SLG Jewelry Designshttp://slgdesigns.wordpress.com Susan Bolton, Fern's Placehttp://www.fernsplace.org Chris Kemp, Noodle Pie Braceletshttp://noodlepiebracelets.com Barbara Kelley, Angels' Keephttp://angelskeepbandbdotcom.wordpress.com Susan Bowerman, Woodside Wireworkshttp://woodsidewireworks.com/ Pamela Anger, Novegatti Designshttp://novegattidesigns.blogspot.com Joan Donovan, Hailey's Cottagehttp://haileyscottage.com/ Alison Huie, Ally's Baubleshttp://www.allysbaubles.blogspot.com Sharon Palac, Sharon's Jewelry Gardenhttp://www.sharonsjewelrygarden.blogspot.com Erica Olmos, Beeb's Closethttps://beebscloset.wordpress.com Erin Whitacre, Shattered Time Jewelryhttps://shatteredtimejewelry.wordpress.com Fran Sitton, Sitton Up Fronthttps://sittonupfront.wordpress.com Ginger Hammond, Lynn Leigh Designshttps://lynnleighdesigns.wordpress.com Paula Gaskill, Lovely LaylaBug Jewelshttp://www.lovelylaylabugjewels.com/Blog.php Mary Deis, The Rose Swordhttp://theroseswordmdeis.blogspot.com Renee Webb Allen, Small Stuff Design    <---- YOU ARE HERE! *waving*http://smallstuffdesign.com Valerie Tilghman, ArtJewelsandGiftshttp://www.artjewelzdimensions.blogspot.com Chris Cravens, Vintage Cravenshttp://christinecravens.blogspot.com Leslie Carver, Adorn Divine Designshttp://www.adorndivinedesigns.blogspot.com Donna Parry, JewelryDonnahttp://jewelrydonna.typepad.com Gina-Marie Hammer, Tangles, Twists and Treasureshttp://tanglestwistsandtreasures.com/blog/ Kelly Wymer, Winged Wisdom Enchantmentshttps://wingedwisdomenchantments.wordpress.com/ Would you like to leave a comment?

The Controversies of the United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006 involved both Republican incumbent senator George Allen and Democratic opponent Jim Webb. However, a majority of these controversies are involved with Allen, which contributed to his downfall and eventual defeat.

Allen's Barr Labs investment[edit]
On August 8, 2006, it was reported that Allen, who opposes abortion rights, owned stock in Barr Laboratories, maker of the Plan B "morning-after pill", an emergency contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. The Webb campaign criticized Allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose. Allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because Barr Labs has created jobs in Virginia, and by pointing to his consistently pro-life voting record. Allen has no plans to sell the stock.[1]
Allen's Macaca controversy[edit]
Further information: Macaca (term)
On August 11, 2006, George Allen twice called S.R. Sidarth, a 20-year-old Webb campaign volunteer, macaca. Sidarth is of Indian ancestry, but was born and raised in Fairfax County, Virginia. As a "tracker" for the opposing Webb campaign, Sidarth was filming an Allen campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia, near the Kentucky border.
During a speech, Allen paused, then began referring to Sidarth:


“
This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent. He's following us around everywhere. And it's just great. We're going to places all over Virginia, and he's having it on film and it's great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because he's never been there and probably will never come. [...] Let's give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.[2]
”


According to Sidarth, he was the only non-white person present among the crowd of 100 or so Republican supporters, some of whom applauded Allen's remarks.[2]
The Webb campaign accused Allen of using a racial insult; macaca has been identified as a Francophone epithet for North African indigenes, and commentators have suggested that he may have heard the slur from his mother, Henrietta "Etty" Allen, who is a pied-noir, or North African (in Allen's case, a Tunisian) of French nationality.[3] During a televised debate on September 18, reporter Peggy Fox asked Allen if he had learned the slur from his mother; Etty Allen denied that she had ever used the word before.[4]
According to the Washington Post, Allen's campaign manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive. Allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to Sidarth, that he did not know what the word meant, and that he did not intend to insult Sidarth's ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd. "I do apologize if he's offended by that," Allen said, adding that "I would never want to demean him as an individual."[2]
Shortly after, Allen's campaign held that he used the word in reference to Sidarth's hairstyle. Although Sidarth was wearing a baseball cap on the day of the incident,[5] he had been conversing casually with Allen's aides during campaign stops before the incident.[6] Allen's campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as "Mohawk".[2] A now widely disseminated photo of Sidarth,[7] hosted by the Webb campaign, shows Sidarth's hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides, typical of a mohawk.
On August 15, 2006, John Reid, Allen's communications director, told the New York Times that members of Allen's campaign had "good-naturedly" nicknamed Sidarth "Mohawk" when speaking among themselves, but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca.[8] Reid told the Times that Sidarth only received a nickname from Allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name. Interviewed that day on CNN, however, Sidarth recalled shaking Allen's hand earlier in the week and giving his name. "He's very good with names, legendarily. He tries very hard to remember peoples' names when meeting them," Sidarth said. As for the macaca remark, "I am disappointed that someone like a Senator of the United States could use something [so] completely offensive."[9]
On August 16, 2006, the National Journal reported that two Virginia Republicans who heard the word used by Allen's campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca, Spanish and French slang for excrement. The National Journal quoted a Republican close to the campaign saying, "In other words, [Sidarth] was a shit-head, an annoyance."[10]
By August 20, 2006, Allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word, and that he simply made it up, contrary to original explanations from Allen and his staff.[11][12][13]
After several public apologies, Allen called Sidarth twelve days after the incident, on August 23, to apologize directly for his remarks. Allen's campaign manager Dick Wadhams has continued to blame opponent Webb, the media, and Allen's "leftist" foes for a "feeding frenzy."[14] The incident reduced Allen's once-broad polling margin over Webb to single digits.[15]
On September 19, John Podhoretz used the name "Felix Macacawitz" as a headline for a post in the National Review blog "The Corner".[16] On October 4, Weed for Congress field organizer Meryl Ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of Weed.[17]
Some political observers believe the incident shows an early-21st-century shift in American politics. Salon.com named Sidarth its 2006 Person of the Year. Michael Scherer wrote, "Sidarth was the kid next door. He, not Allen, was the real Virginian. He was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the GOP's solid South and toward a day when Allen's act will be a tacky antique. Allen was the past, Sidarth is the wired, diverse future -- of Virginia, the political process and the country." [18]
Relating to the Allen controversy, "Macaca" was named the most politically incorrect word of 2006 on December 15 by Global Language Monitor, a nonprofit group that studies word usage.[19]
Despite his initial offense at the term, Sidarth later embraced it in a Washington Post opinion piece titled "I Am Macaca".[20] Weeks following Allen's comment, Sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a Larry Sabato-taught class at the University of Virginia of only three words: "I am macaca".[21]
Webb's Reagan ad[edit]
On September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement.[22] It featured footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan praising Webb at the secretary's alma mater, the United States Naval Academy in 1985.
The next day, an official working for the Reagan Presidential Foundation faxed a letter to Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement.[23] In response, Webb told reporters that if Ronald Reagan had made any speeches about Allen his opponent's campaign would probably use them, too. "I would encourage them to try to go find some."[24]
The Webb advertisement also aired in Norfolk, Roanoke, and Northern Virginia.
The Reagan Library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former president's image. In 2004, it criticized the conservative Club for Growth for an advertisement comparing George W. Bush to Reagan.[25]
On September 15, 2006, a Washington Post editorial supported Webb's advertisement and chided the Allen campaign for crying foul, saying that neither protest by Allen's campaign or Reagan's Library (later corrected to the Reagan Presidential Foundation) has any merit:


“
The president is a public official, paid by the taxpayers. His speeches are in the public domain; they belong to all Americans, and to history. His words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come, but they should not be censored posthumously. In this instance, Mr. Webb has neither distorted Mr. Reagan's words nor taken them out of context; nor did Mr. Reagan ever repudiate them.[23]
”


Allen at Fairfax County Republican Committee's ethnic rally[edit]
On September 9, 2006, Allen attended, along with other Republican elected officials and candidates for public office, an "ethnic community rally" at Thomas Edison High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. The Fairfax County Republican Committee, together with several ethnically-based Republican groups, had sponsored this event for the past several years. Participating organizations included local Republican groups drawn from the Asian American, African American, and Hispanic American communities, among others. A small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school, including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to Allen's macaca remark. One protester said she was there "to let him [George Allen] know that racism is not acceptable", while another protester suggested that Allen was "holding a fake diversity rally".[26]
Both Allen and Webb's supporters video-recorded the event. Webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than non-white.[27] The Virginian-Pilot described the crowd as chiefly Asian-American. Webb, according to exit polls, went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly, including Asian-Americans.[28]
Webb's stance on women in combat[edit]




Jim Webb at a rally, c. September 20, 2006


On September 13, 2006, five female graduates of the United States Naval Academy had a press conference promoted by the Allen campaign to assail a Washingtonian article Webb wrote in 1979. They accuse Webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy. In the article, entitled "Women Can't Fight", Webb described his personal experiences in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Marine infantry officer, and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women. Webb also wrote that he had never met a woman "whom [he] would trust to provide those men with combat leadership". The article also characterized the Naval Academy dormitory situation as "a horny woman's dream", due to the ratio of men to women being 13⅓ to 1 at the time.
The five women, who attended the Naval Academy from the late 1970s to early 1980s, asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them. Some even went so far as to wear "Jim Webb Fan Club" t-shirts.
In response to the allegations, Webb's campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country, and the tone of this article was no exception. He added that he is "completely comfortable" with the present roles of women within the Naval Academy and the modern military. Webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects, "and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the Academy or the active Armed Forces to undue hardship, I remain profoundly sorry."[29]
Allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the Virginia Military Institute. Allen remarked in 2000 that women "should not be in foxholes", and that "[t]he purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment".[30] A 2000 candidate-guide published by the Virginian-Pilot reiterated this stance of Allen's.[31]
Allen's remarks about his Jewish heritage[edit]
In the wake of the Macaca controversy, the Jewish periodical The Forward reported that in all likelihood, Allen's mother Etty Allen, née Henrietta Lumbroso, was Jewish "from the august Sephardic Jewish Lumbroso family",[32] and that therefore by the Jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent, Allen himself would be considered Jewish.
On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated each other at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.[33] One of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: "It has been reported [that] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for "making aspersions" and responded: "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her."[34][35] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read:


“
I was raised as a Christian and my mother was raised as a Christian. And I embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage, including my Lumbroso family line’s Jewish heritage, which I learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed.[36]
”


Allen also told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a reference to kosher dieting, "I still had a ham sandwich for lunch. And my mother made great pork chops."[37] The Washington Post reported that Allen's mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public, and had originally asked Allen to keep that information private.[38] Although no mention is made of her mother's religion in Allen's sister's book, she does mention that the Catholic Church, before marrying the couple, required Allen's parents to agree that any children would be raised Catholic, and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a Jewish friend.[32]
PAC ad on Allen's body armor vote[edit]
In mid-September, VoteVets.org, a political action committee formed in 2006 that is primarily composed of former Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and headed by Jon Soltz, released a television advertisement criticizing Allen for voting against body armor for US troops in 2003.[39] The claim was based on Allen's vote against a Democratic amendment that would have increased National Guard funding for body armor.
Various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim. The Arizona Republic ran a piece headlined "VoteVets ad is pure deceit."[40] FactCheck.org said the ad contained "false claims."[41] But Media Matters for America said Allen voted against troop body armor not once, but twice.[42]
In March 2003, Allen voted against a bill that "targets shortfalls identified by the National Guard and Reserve in their Unfunded Requirement lists," including the shortage of helmets, tents, bullet-proof inserts, and tactical vests.[42] On October 2, 2003, Allen voted against a Democratic amendment by Senator Christopher Dodd to add $322 million to the $300 million (for body armor and battlefield cleanup) that the Senate Appropriations Committee had already attached to an $87 billion emergency supplemental bill.[42]
Allen's use of racial epithets[edit]
Salon published a story in late September reporting that three of Allen's former college football teammates said that during the 1970s, Allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks.[43] On September 29, Edward Sabornie, a professor at North Carolina State University who had been in Allen's class and played football with him, decided to go on record with his allegations. Sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in Salon's previous article about Allen's use of the slur. In that article, he was described as a "white teammate" and commented that using racial epithets "was so common with George when he was among his white friends. [It was] the terminology he used." Sabornie also recalled Allen as having referred to blacks as "roaches" and Latinos as "wetbacks".[44]
Following the first Salon article, pundit Larry Sabato, who attended the University of Virginia at the same time as Allen, stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that Allen used the epithet. Sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else.[45] Allen called the claims "ludicrously false", explaining, "[t]he story and [Shelton's] comments and assertions in [the claim] are completely false. I don't remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary."[46]
Sons of Confederate Veterans[edit]
On September 28, 2006 the Sons of Confederate Veterans criticized Allen when the group claimed Allen criticized Southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the Confederate Battle flag had negative racial overtones.[47]
Webb's use of racial epithets[edit]
In late September, Webb was asked if he had ever used the word "nigger". Webb replied that "I don't think that there's anyone who grew up around the South that hasn't had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life." Webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in Fields of Fire, a novel Webb wrote about the Vietnam War.[48]
Allen campaign officials referred reporters to Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb and members of his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, "point the rifles at them [black people], pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and do that kind of thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I would never do that. I would never want to do that." Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.[49]
An October 18, 2006, article in the Washington Post quotes a recent interview with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. If you write that word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, I use it defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".[50]
Allen's undisclosed business interests[edit]
On October 8, 2006, the Associated Press, reviewing five years of Allen's financial records, reported that Allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts, and contacted the Army to help a company in which he has an interest.[51] Allen's staff said Allen believed in "good faith" that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value.
Following the AP report, Allen asked the Senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options. The ethics committee ruled than Allen was not required to disclose his stock options, and did not err in not doing so.[52]
Webb's name truncated on ballots[edit]
On October 24, 2006, the Washington Post reported that Webb's last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in Alexandria, Falls Church and Charlottesville. Webb's name should have appeared as James H. 'Jim' Webb but only James H. 'Jim' showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the InterCivic voting machines. Allen's name George F. Allen was not affected by this glitch. The Virginia State Board of Elections pledged to have it fixed by the 2007 statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error.[53]
Sexually explicit passages from Webb novels[edit]
On October 26, 2006, the Drudge Report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from Webb's novels. One excerpt involved a man placing his son's penis in his mouth; others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women. The press release, which the Drudge Report attributed to the Allen campaign, said the passages fit "a continued pattern of demeaning women" in which Webb "refuse[s] to portray women in a respectful, positive light".[54] Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, WTOP-FM, whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.[55]
In a radio interview on October 27, 2006, Webb described the Allen campaign's tactics as "smear after smear", and called the attack on his fiction baseless "character assassination". Webb defended his fiction work, saying that "the duty of a writer is to illuminate [his] surroundings". He said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a Bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist[56] and that it was "not a sexual act".[57]
Responding to the controversy, Allen stated: "My record as a United States senator is an open book. My opponent has a record as well. He, in his advertisements, points out that he's an author, that he's a writer of books. That's part of his record. These passages in his books are part of his open record. I'll let the people of Virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with."[58]
At a campaign rally in Annandale on October 28, 2006, Webb noted that his novel Fields of Fire has been on the Commandant of the Marine Corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the "most-taught piece of literature regarding the Vietnam War" on college campuses.[58] Webb further listed the various accolades his books have received.[59]
Allen's arrest warrant records[edit]
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has criticized Allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in 1974.[60]
Allen supporters attack blogger[edit]
On October 31, footage of multiple Allen supporters attacking a constituent, Mike Stark, during a campaign stop in Charlottesville, Virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources.[61] Stark, a liberal blogger, Marine veteran and law student, attempted to ask Allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers. After yelling out a question about rumors of Allen having assaulted his first wife, Stark was "briefly placed in a headlock, restrained, slung to the ground, and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three Allen supporters".[62] Stark was detained several days later at another rally after an Allen supporter claimed Stark pushed him to the ground.[63]
Telephone intimidation[edit]
The FBI launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential Democratic voters in eight counties before the poll, by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted, a classic example of voter suppression.[64]

Allen's Barr Labs investment[edit]
On August 8, 2006, it was reported that Allen, who opposes abortion rights, owned stock in Barr Laboratories, maker of the Plan B "morning-after pill", an emergency contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. The Webb campaign criticized Allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose. Allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because Barr Labs has created jobs in Virginia, and by pointing to his consistently pro-life voting record. Allen has no plans to sell the stock.[1]
Allen's Macaca controversy[edit]
Further information: Macaca (term)
On August 11, 2006, George Allen twice called S.R. Sidarth, a 20-year-old Webb campaign volunteer, macaca. Sidarth is of Indian ancestry, but was born and raised in Fairfax County, Virginia. As a "tracker" for the opposing Webb campaign, Sidarth was filming an Allen campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia, near the Kentucky border.
During a speech, Allen paused, then began referring to Sidarth:


“
This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent. He's following us around everywhere. And it's just great. We're going to places all over Virginia, and he's having it on film and it's great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because he's never been there and probably will never come. [...] Let's give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.[2]
”


According to Sidarth, he was the only non-white person present among the crowd of 100 or so Republican supporters, some of whom applauded Allen's remarks.[2]
The Webb campaign accused Allen of using a racial insult; macaca has been identified as a Francophone epithet for North African indigenes, and commentators have suggested that he may have heard the slur from his mother, Henrietta "Etty" Allen, who is a pied-noir, or North African (in Allen's case, a Tunisian) of French nationality.[3] During a televised debate on September 18, reporter Peggy Fox asked Allen if he had learned the slur from his mother; Etty Allen denied that she had ever used the word before.[4]
According to the Washington Post, Allen's campaign manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive. Allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to Sidarth, that he did not know what the word meant, and that he did not intend to insult Sidarth's ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd. "I do apologize if he's offended by that," Allen said, adding that "I would never want to demean him as an individual."[2]
Shortly after, Allen's campaign held that he used the word in reference to Sidarth's hairstyle. Although Sidarth was wearing a baseball cap on the day of the incident,[5] he had been conversing casually with Allen's aides during campaign stops before the incident.[6] Allen's campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as "Mohawk".[2] A now widely disseminated photo of Sidarth,[7] hosted by the Webb campaign, shows Sidarth's hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides, typical of a mohawk.
On August 15, 2006, John Reid, Allen's communications director, told the New York Times that members of Allen's campaign had "good-naturedly" nicknamed Sidarth "Mohawk" when speaking among themselves, but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca.[8] Reid told the Times that Sidarth only received a nickname from Allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name. Interviewed that day on CNN, however, Sidarth recalled shaking Allen's hand earlier in the week and giving his name. "He's very good with names, legendarily. He tries very hard to remember peoples' names when meeting them," Sidarth said. As for the macaca remark, "I am disappointed that someone like a Senator of the United States could use something [so] completely offensive."[9]
On August 16, 2006, the National Journal reported that two Virginia Republicans who heard the word used by Allen's campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca, Spanish and French slang for excrement. The National Journal quoted a Republican close to the campaign saying, "In other words, [Sidarth] was a shit-head, an annoyance."[10]
By August 20, 2006, Allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word, and that he simply made it up, contrary to original explanations from Allen and his staff.[11][12][13]
After several public apologies, Allen called Sidarth twelve days after the incident, on August 23, to apologize directly for his remarks. Allen's campaign manager Dick Wadhams has continued to blame opponent Webb, the media, and Allen's "leftist" foes for a "feeding frenzy."[14] The incident reduced Allen's once-broad polling margin over Webb to single digits.[15]
On September 19, John Podhoretz used the name "Felix Macacawitz" as a headline for a post in the National Review blog "The Corner".[16] On October 4, Weed for Congress field organizer Meryl Ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of Weed.[17]
Some political observers believe the incident shows an early-21st-century shift in American politics. Salon.com named Sidarth its 2006 Person of the Year. Michael Scherer wrote, "Sidarth was the kid next door. He, not Allen, was the real Virginian. He was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the GOP's solid South and toward a day when Allen's act will be a tacky antique. Allen was the past, Sidarth is the wired, diverse future -- of Virginia, the political process and the country." [18]
Relating to the Allen controversy, "Macaca" was named the most politically incorrect word of 2006 on December 15 by Global Language Monitor, a nonprofit group that studies word usage.[19]
Despite his initial offense at the term, Sidarth later embraced it in a Washington Post opinion piece titled "I Am Macaca".[20] Weeks following Allen's comment, Sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a Larry Sabato-taught class at the University of Virginia of only three words: "I am macaca".[21]
Webb's Reagan ad[edit]
On September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement.[22] It featured footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan praising Webb at the secretary's alma mater, the United States Naval Academy in 1985.
The next day, an official working for the Reagan Presidential Foundation faxed a letter to Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement.[23] In response, Webb told reporters that if Ronald Reagan had made any speeches about Allen his opponent's campaign would probably use them, too. "I would encourage them to try to go find some."[24]
The Webb advertisement also aired in Norfolk, Roanoke, and Northern Virginia.
The Reagan Library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former president's image. In 2004, it criticized the conservative Club for Growth for an advertisement comparing George W. Bush to Reagan.[25]
On September 15, 2006, a Washington Post editorial supported Webb's advertisement and chided the Allen campaign for crying foul, saying that neither protest by Allen's campaign or Reagan's Library (later corrected to the Reagan Presidential Foundation) has any merit:


“
The president is a public official, paid by the taxpayers. His speeches are in the public domain; they belong to all Americans, and to history. His words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come, but they should not be censored posthumously. In this instance, Mr. Webb has neither distorted Mr. Reagan's words nor taken them out of context; nor did Mr. Reagan ever repudiate them.[23]
”


Allen at Fairfax County Republican Committee's ethnic rally[edit]
On September 9, 2006, Allen attended, along with other Republican elected officials and candidates for public office, an "ethnic community rally" at Thomas Edison High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. The Fairfax County Republican Committee, together with several ethnically-based Republican groups, had sponsored this event for the past several years. Participating organizations included local Republican groups drawn from the Asian American, African American, and Hispanic American communities, among others. A small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school, including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to Allen's macaca remark. One protester said she was there "to let him [George Allen] know that racism is not acceptable", while another protester suggested that Allen was "holding a fake diversity rally".[26]
Both Allen and Webb's supporters video-recorded the event. Webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than non-white.[27] The Virginian-Pilot described the crowd as chiefly Asian-American. Webb, according to exit polls, went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly, including Asian-Americans.[28]
Webb's stance on women in combat[edit]




Jim Webb at a rally, c. September 20, 2006


On September 13, 2006, five female graduates of the United States Naval Academy had a press conference promoted by the Allen campaign to assail a Washingtonian article Webb wrote in 1979. They accuse Webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy. In the article, entitled "Women Can't Fight", Webb described his personal experiences in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Marine infantry officer, and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women. Webb also wrote that he had never met a woman "whom [he] would trust to provide those men with combat leadership". The article also characterized the Naval Academy dormitory situation as "a horny woman's dream", due to the ratio of men to women being 13⅓ to 1 at the time.
The five women, who attended the Naval Academy from the late 1970s to early 1980s, asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them. Some even went so far as to wear "Jim Webb Fan Club" t-shirts.
In response to the allegations, Webb's campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country, and the tone of this article was no exception. He added that he is "completely comfortable" with the present roles of women within the Naval Academy and the modern military. Webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects, "and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the Academy or the active Armed Forces to undue hardship, I remain profoundly sorry."[29]
Allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the Virginia Military Institute. Allen remarked in 2000 that women "should not be in foxholes", and that "[t]he purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment".[30] A 2000 candidate-guide published by the Virginian-Pilot reiterated this stance of Allen's.[31]
Allen's remarks about his Jewish heritage[edit]
In the wake of the Macaca controversy, the Jewish periodical The Forward reported that in all likelihood, Allen's mother Etty Allen, née Henrietta Lumbroso, was Jewish "from the august Sephardic Jewish Lumbroso family",[32] and that therefore by the Jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent, Allen himself would be considered Jewish.
On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated each other at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.[33] One of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: "It has been reported [that] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for "making aspersions" and responded: "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her."[34][35] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read:


“
I was raised as a Christian and my mother was raised as a Christian. And I embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage, including my Lumbroso family line’s Jewish heritage, which I learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed.[36]
”


Allen also told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a reference to kosher dieting, "I still had a ham sandwich for lunch. And my mother made great pork chops."[37] The Washington Post reported that Allen's mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public, and had originally asked Allen to keep that information private.[38] Although no mention is made of her mother's religion in Allen's sister's book, she does mention that the Catholic Church, before marrying the couple, required Allen's parents to agree that any children would be raised Catholic, and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a Jewish friend.[32]
PAC ad on Allen's body armor vote[edit]
In mid-September, VoteVets.org, a political action committee formed in 2006 that is primarily composed of former Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and headed by Jon Soltz, released a television advertisement criticizing Allen for voting against body armor for US troops in 2003.[39] The claim was based on Allen's vote against a Democratic amendment that would have increased National Guard funding for body armor.
Various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim. The Arizona Republic ran a piece headlined "VoteVets ad is pure deceit."[40] FactCheck.org said the ad contained "false claims."[41] But Media Matters for America said Allen voted against troop body armor not once, but twice.[42]
In March 2003, Allen voted against a bill that "targets shortfalls identified by the National Guard and Reserve in their Unfunded Requirement lists," including the shortage of helmets, tents, bullet-proof inserts, and tactical vests.[42] On October 2, 2003, Allen voted against a Democratic amendment by Senator Christopher Dodd to add $322 million to the $300 million (for body armor and battlefield cleanup) that the Senate Appropriations Committee had already attached to an $87 billion emergency supplemental bill.[42]
Allen's use of racial epithets[edit]
Salon published a story in late September reporting that three of Allen's former college football teammates said that during the 1970s, Allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks.[43] On September 29, Edward Sabornie, a professor at North Carolina State University who had been in Allen's class and played football with him, decided to go on record with his allegations. Sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in Salon's previous article about Allen's use of the slur. In that article, he was described as a "white teammate" and commented that using racial epithets "was so common with George when he was among his white friends. [It was] the terminology he used." Sabornie also recalled Allen as having referred to blacks as "roaches" and Latinos as "wetbacks".[44]
Following the first Salon article, pundit Larry Sabato, who attended the University of Virginia at the same time as Allen, stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that Allen used the epithet. Sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else.[45] Allen called the claims "ludicrously false", explaining, "[t]he story and [Shelton's] comments and assertions in [the claim] are completely false. I don't remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary."[46]
Sons of Confederate Veterans[edit]
On September 28, 2006 the Sons of Confederate Veterans criticized Allen when the group claimed Allen criticized Southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the Confederate Battle flag had negative racial overtones.[47]
Webb's use of racial epithets[edit]
In late September, Webb was asked if he had ever used the word "nigger". Webb replied that "I don't think that there's anyone who grew up around the South that hasn't had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life." Webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in Fields of Fire, a novel Webb wrote about the Vietnam War.[48]
Allen campaign officials referred reporters to Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb and members of his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, "point the rifles at them [black people], pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and do that kind of thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I would never do that. I would never want to do that." Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.[49]
An October 18, 2006, article in the Washington Post quotes a recent interview with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. If you write that word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, I use it defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".[50]
Allen's undisclosed business interests[edit]
On October 8, 2006, the Associated Press, reviewing five years of Allen's financial records, reported that Allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts, and contacted the Army to help a company in which he has an interest.[51] Allen's staff said Allen believed in "good faith" that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value.
Following the AP report, Allen asked the Senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options. The ethics committee ruled than Allen was not required to disclose his stock options, and did not err in not doing so.[52]
Webb's name truncated on ballots[edit]
On October 24, 2006, the Washington Post reported that Webb's last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in Alexandria, Falls Church and Charlottesville. Webb's name should have appeared as James H. 'Jim' Webb but only James H. 'Jim' showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the InterCivic voting machines. Allen's name George F. Allen was not affected by this glitch. The Virginia State Board of Elections pledged to have it fixed by the 2007 statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error.[53]
Sexually explicit passages from Webb novels[edit]
On October 26, 2006, the Drudge Report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from Webb's novels. One excerpt involved a man placing his son's penis in his mouth; others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women. The press release, which the Drudge Report attributed to the Allen campaign, said the passages fit "a continued pattern of demeaning women" in which Webb "refuse[s] to portray women in a respectful, positive light".[54] Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, WTOP-FM, whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.[55]
In a radio interview on October 27, 2006, Webb described the Allen campaign's tactics as "smear after smear", and called the attack on his fiction baseless "character assassination". Webb defended his fiction work, saying that "the duty of a writer is to illuminate [his] surroundings". He said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a Bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist[56] and that it was "not a sexual act".[57]
Responding to the controversy, Allen stated: "My record as a United States senator is an open book. My opponent has a record as well. He, in his advertisements, points out that he's an author, that he's a writer of books. That's part of his record. These passages in his books are part of his open record. I'll let the people of Virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with."[58]
At a campaign rally in Annandale on October 28, 2006, Webb noted that his novel Fields of Fire has been on the Commandant of the Marine Corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the "most-taught piece of literature regarding the Vietnam War" on college campuses.[58] Webb further listed the various accolades his books have received.[59]
Allen's arrest warrant records[edit]
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has criticized Allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in 1974.[60]
Allen supporters attack blogger[edit]
On October 31, footage of multiple Allen supporters attacking a constituent, Mike Stark, during a campaign stop in Charlottesville, Virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources.[61] Stark, a liberal blogger, Marine veteran and law student, attempted to ask Allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers. After yelling out a question about rumors of Allen having assaulted his first wife, Stark was "briefly placed in a headlock, restrained, slung to the ground, and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three Allen supporters".[62] Stark was detained several days later at another rally after an Allen supporter claimed Stark pushed him to the ground.[63]
Telephone intimidation[edit]
The FBI launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential Democratic voters in eight counties before the poll, by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted, a classic example of voter suppression.[64]

The Controversies of the United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006 involved both Republican incumbent senator George Allen and Democratic opponent Jim Webb. However, a majority of these controversies are involved with Allen, which contributed to his downfall and eventual defeat.

Allen's Barr Labs investment[edit]
On August 8, 2006, it was reported that Allen, who opposes abortion rights, owned stock in Barr Laboratories, maker of the Plan B "morning-after pill", an emergency contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. The Webb campaign criticized Allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose. Allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because Barr Labs has created jobs in Virginia, and by pointing to his consistently pro-life voting record. Allen has no plans to sell the stock.[1]
Allen's Macaca controversy[edit]
Further information: Macaca (term)
On August 11, 2006, George Allen twice called S.R. Sidarth, a 20-year-old Webb campaign volunteer, macaca. Sidarth is of Indian ancestry, but was born and raised in Fairfax County, Virginia. As a "tracker" for the opposing Webb campaign, Sidarth was filming an Allen campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia, near the Kentucky border.
During a speech, Allen paused, then began referring to Sidarth:


“
This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent. He's following us around everywhere. And it's just great. We're going to places all over Virginia, and he's having it on film and it's great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because he's never been there and probably will never come. [...] Let's give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.[2]
”


According to Sidarth, he was the only non-white person present among the crowd of 100 or so Republican supporters, some of whom applauded Allen's remarks.[2]
The Webb campaign accused Allen of using a racial insult; macaca has been identified as a Francophone epithet for North African indigenes, and commentators have suggested that he may have heard the slur from his mother, Henrietta "Etty" Allen, who is a pied-noir, or North African (in Allen's case, a Tunisian) of French nationality.[3] During a televised debate on September 18, reporter Peggy Fox asked Allen if he had learned the slur from his mother; Etty Allen denied that she had ever used the word before.[4]
According to the Washington Post, Allen's campaign manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive. Allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to Sidarth, that he did not know what the word meant, and that he did not intend to insult Sidarth's ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd. "I do apologize if he's offended by that," Allen said, adding that "I would never want to demean him as an individual."[2]
Shortly after, Allen's campaign held that he used the word in reference to Sidarth's hairstyle. Although Sidarth was wearing a baseball cap on the day of the incident,[5] he had been conversing casually with Allen's aides during campaign stops before the incident.[6] Allen's campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as "Mohawk".[2] A now widely disseminated photo of Sidarth,[7] hosted by the Webb campaign, shows Sidarth's hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides, typical of a mohawk.
On August 15, 2006, John Reid, Allen's communications director, told the New York Times that members of Allen's campaign had "good-naturedly" nicknamed Sidarth "Mohawk" when speaking among themselves, but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca.[8] Reid told the Times that Sidarth only received a nickname from Allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name. Interviewed that day on CNN, however, Sidarth recalled shaking Allen's hand earlier in the week and giving his name. "He's very good with names, legendarily. He tries very hard to remember peoples' names when meeting them," Sidarth said. As for the macaca remark, "I am disappointed that someone like a Senator of the United States could use something [so] completely offensive."[9]
On August 16, 2006, the National Journal reported that two Virginia Republicans who heard the word used by Allen's campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca, Spanish and French slang for excrement. The National Journal quoted a Republican close to the campaign saying, "In other words, [Sidarth] was a shit-head, an annoyance."[10]
By August 20, 2006, Allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word, and that he simply made it up, contrary to original explanations from Allen and his staff.[11][12][13]
After several public apologies, Allen called Sidarth twelve days after the incident, on August 23, to apologize directly for his remarks. Allen's campaign manager Dick Wadhams has continued to blame opponent Webb, the media, and Allen's "leftist" foes for a "feeding frenzy."[14] The incident reduced Allen's once-broad polling margin over Webb to single digits.[15]
On September 19, John Podhoretz used the name "Felix Macacawitz" as a headline for a post in the National Review blog "The Corner".[16] On October 4, Weed for Congress field organizer Meryl Ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of Weed.[17]
Some political observers believe the incident shows an early-21st-century shift in American politics. Salon.com named Sidarth its 2006 Person of the Year. Michael Scherer wrote, "Sidarth was the kid next door. He, not Allen, was the real Virginian. He was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the GOP's solid South and toward a day when Allen's act will be a tacky antique. Allen was the past, Sidarth is the wired, diverse future -- of Virginia, the political process and the country." [18]
Relating to the Allen controversy, "Macaca" was named the most politically incorrect word of 2006 on December 15 by Global Language Monitor, a nonprofit group that studies word usage.[19]
Despite his initial offense at the term, Sidarth later embraced it in a Washington Post opinion piece titled "I Am Macaca".[20] Weeks following Allen's comment, Sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a Larry Sabato-taught class at the University of Virginia of only three words: "I am macaca".[21]
Webb's Reagan ad[edit]
On September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement.[22] It featured footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan praising Webb at the secretary's alma mater, the United States Naval Academy in 1985.
The next day, an official working for the Reagan Presidential Foundation faxed a letter to Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement.[23] In response, Webb told reporters that if Ronald Reagan had made any speeches about Allen his opponent's campaign would probably use them, too. "I would encourage them to try to go find some."[24]
The Webb advertisement also aired in Norfolk, Roanoke, and Northern Virginia.
The Reagan Library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former president's image. In 2004, it criticized the conservative Club for Growth for an advertisement comparing George W. Bush to Reagan.[25]
On September 15, 2006, a Washington Post editorial supported Webb's advertisement and chided the Allen campaign for crying foul, saying that neither protest by Allen's campaign or Reagan's Library (later corrected to the Reagan Presidential Foundation) has any merit:


“
The president is a public official, paid by the taxpayers. His speeches are in the public domain; they belong to all Americans, and to history. His words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come, but they should not be censored posthumously. In this instance, Mr. Webb has neither distorted Mr. Reagan's words nor taken them out of context; nor did Mr. Reagan ever repudiate them.[23]
”


Allen at Fairfax County Republican Committee's ethnic rally[edit]
On September 9, 2006, Allen attended, along with other Republican elected officials and candidates for public office, an "ethnic community rally" at Thomas Edison High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. The Fairfax County Republican Committee, together with several ethnically-based Republican groups, had sponsored this event for the past several years. Participating organizations included local Republican groups drawn from the Asian American, African American, and Hispanic American communities, among others. A small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school, including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to Allen's macaca remark. One protester said she was there "to let him [George Allen] know that racism is not acceptable", while another protester suggested that Allen was "holding a fake diversity rally".[26]
Both Allen and Webb's supporters video-recorded the event. Webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than non-white.[27] The Virginian-Pilot described the crowd as chiefly Asian-American. Webb, according to exit polls, went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly, including Asian-Americans.[28]
Webb's stance on women in combat[edit]




Jim Webb at a rally, c. September 20, 2006


On September 13, 2006, five female graduates of the United States Naval Academy had a press conference promoted by the Allen campaign to assail a Washingtonian article Webb wrote in 1979. They accuse Webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy. In the article, entitled "Women Can't Fight", Webb described his personal experiences in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Marine infantry officer, and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women. Webb also wrote that he had never met a woman "whom [he] would trust to provide those men with combat leadership". The article also characterized the Naval Academy dormitory situation as "a horny woman's dream", due to the ratio of men to women being 13⅓ to 1 at the time.
The five women, who attended the Naval Academy from the late 1970s to early 1980s, asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them. Some even went so far as to wear "Jim Webb Fan Club" t-shirts.
In response to the allegations, Webb's campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country, and the tone of this article was no exception. He added that he is "completely comfortable" with the present roles of women within the Naval Academy and the modern military. Webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects, "and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the Academy or the active Armed Forces to undue hardship, I remain profoundly sorry."[29]
Allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the Virginia Military Institute. Allen remarked in 2000 that women "should not be in foxholes", and that "[t]he purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment".[30] A 2000 candidate-guide published by the Virginian-Pilot reiterated this stance of Allen's.[31]
Allen's remarks about his Jewish heritage[edit]
In the wake of the Macaca controversy, the Jewish periodical The Forward reported that in all likelihood, Allen's mother Etty Allen, née Henrietta Lumbroso, was Jewish "from the august Sephardic Jewish Lumbroso family",[32] and that therefore by the Jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent, Allen himself would be considered Jewish.
On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated each other at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.[33] One of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: "It has been reported [that] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for "making aspersions" and responded: "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her."[34][35] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read:


“
I was raised as a Christian and my mother was raised as a Christian. And I embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage, including my Lumbroso family line’s Jewish heritage, which I learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed.[36]
”


Allen also told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a reference to kosher dieting, "I still had a ham sandwich for lunch. And my mother made great pork chops."[37] The Washington Post reported that Allen's mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public, and had originally asked Allen to keep that information private.[38] Although no mention is made of her mother's religion in Allen's sister's book, she does mention that the Catholic Church, before marrying the couple, required Allen's parents to agree that any children would be raised Catholic, and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a Jewish friend.[32]
PAC ad on Allen's body armor vote[edit]
In mid-September, VoteVets.org, a political action committee formed in 2006 that is primarily composed of former Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and headed by Jon Soltz, released a television advertisement criticizing Allen for voting against body armor for US troops in 2003.[39] The claim was based on Allen's vote against a Democratic amendment that would have increased National Guard funding for body armor.
Various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim. The Arizona Republic ran a piece headlined "VoteVets ad is pure deceit."[40] FactCheck.org said the ad contained "false claims."[41] But Media Matters for America said Allen voted against troop body armor not once, but twice.[42]
In March 2003, Allen voted against a bill that "targets shortfalls identified by the National Guard and Reserve in their Unfunded Requirement lists," including the shortage of helmets, tents, bullet-proof inserts, and tactical vests.[42] On October 2, 2003, Allen voted against a Democratic amendment by Senator Christopher Dodd to add $322 million to the $300 million (for body armor and battlefield cleanup) that the Senate Appropriations Committee had already attached to an $87 billion emergency supplemental bill.[42]
Allen's use of racial epithets[edit]
Salon published a story in late September reporting that three of Allen's former college football teammates said that during the 1970s, Allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks.[43] On September 29, Edward Sabornie, a professor at North Carolina State University who had been in Allen's class and played football with him, decided to go on record with his allegations. Sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in Salon's previous article about Allen's use of the slur. In that article, he was described as a "white teammate" and commented that using racial epithets "was so common with George when he was among his white friends. [It was] the terminology he used." Sabornie also recalled Allen as having referred to blacks as "roaches" and Latinos as "wetbacks".[44]
Following the first Salon article, pundit Larry Sabato, who attended the University of Virginia at the same time as Allen, stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that Allen used the epithet. Sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else.[45] Allen called the claims "ludicrously false", explaining, "[t]he story and [Shelton's] comments and assertions in [the claim] are completely false. I don't remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary."[46]
Sons of Confederate Veterans[edit]
On September 28, 2006 the Sons of Confederate Veterans criticized Allen when the group claimed Allen criticized Southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the Confederate Battle flag had negative racial overtones.[47]
Webb's use of racial epithets[edit]
In late September, Webb was asked if he had ever used the word "nigger". Webb replied that "I don't think that there's anyone who grew up around the South that hasn't had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life." Webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in Fields of Fire, a novel Webb wrote about the Vietnam War.[48]
Allen campaign officials referred reporters to Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb and members of his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, "point the rifles at them [black people], pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and do that kind of thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I would never do that. I would never want to do that." Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.[49]
An October 18, 2006, article in the Washington Post quotes a recent interview with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. If you write that word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, I use it defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".[50]
Allen's undisclosed business interests[edit]
On October 8, 2006, the Associated Press, reviewing five years of Allen's financial records, reported that Allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts, and contacted the Army to help a company in which he has an interest.[51] Allen's staff said Allen believed in "good faith" that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value.
Following the AP report, Allen asked the Senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options. The ethics committee ruled than Allen was not required to disclose his stock options, and did not err in not doing so.[52]
Webb's name truncated on ballots[edit]
On October 24, 2006, the Washington Post reported that Webb's last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in Alexandria, Falls Church and Charlottesville. Webb's name should have appeared as James H. 'Jim' Webb but only James H. 'Jim' showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the InterCivic voting machines. Allen's name George F. Allen was not affected by this glitch. The Virginia State Board of Elections pledged to have it fixed by the 2007 statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error.[53]
Sexually explicit passages from Webb novels[edit]
On October 26, 2006, the Drudge Report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from Webb's novels. One excerpt involved a man placing his son's penis in his mouth; others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women. The press release, which the Drudge Report attributed to the Allen campaign, said the passages fit "a continued pattern of demeaning women" in which Webb "refuse[s] to portray women in a respectful, positive light".[54] Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, WTOP-FM, whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.[55]
In a radio interview on October 27, 2006, Webb described the Allen campaign's tactics as "smear after smear", and called the attack on his fiction baseless "character assassination". Webb defended his fiction work, saying that "the duty of a writer is to illuminate [his] surroundings". He said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a Bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist[56] and that it was "not a sexual act".[57]
Responding to the controversy, Allen stated: "My record as a United States senator is an open book. My opponent has a record as well. He, in his advertisements, points out that he's an author, that he's a writer of books. That's part of his record. These passages in his books are part of his open record. I'll let the people of Virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with."[58]
At a campaign rally in Annandale on October 28, 2006, Webb noted that his novel Fields of Fire has been on the Commandant of the Marine Corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the "most-taught piece of literature regarding the Vietnam War" on college campuses.[58] Webb further listed the various accolades his books have received.[59]
Allen's arrest warrant records[edit]
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has criticized Allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in 1974.[60]
Allen supporters attack blogger[edit]
On October 31, footage of multiple Allen supporters attacking a constituent, Mike Stark, during a campaign stop in Charlottesville, Virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources.[61] Stark, a liberal blogger, Marine veteran and law student, attempted to ask Allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers. After yelling out a question about rumors of Allen having assaulted his first wife, Stark was "briefly placed in a headlock, restrained, slung to the ground, and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three Allen supporters".[62] Stark was detained several days later at another rally after an Allen supporter claimed Stark pushed him to the ground.[63]
Telephone intimidation[edit]
The FBI launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential Democratic voters in eight counties before the poll, by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted, a classic example of voter suppression.[64]

The Controversies of the United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006 involved both Republican incumbent senator George Allen and Democratic opponent Jim Webb. However, a majority of these controversies are involved with Allen, which contributed to his downfall and eventual defeat.

Allen's Barr Labs investment[edit]
On August 8, 2006, it was reported that Allen, who opposes abortion rights, owned stock in Barr Laboratories, maker of the Plan B "morning-after pill", an emergency contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. The Webb campaign criticized Allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose. Allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because Barr Labs has created jobs in Virginia, and by pointing to his consistently pro-life voting record. Allen has no plans to sell the stock.[1]
Allen's Macaca controversy[edit]
Further information: Macaca (term)
On August 11, 2006, George Allen twice called S.R. Sidarth, a 20-year-old Webb campaign volunteer, macaca. Sidarth is of Indian ancestry, but was born and raised in Fairfax County, Virginia. As a "tracker" for the opposing Webb campaign, Sidarth was filming an Allen campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia, near the Kentucky border.
During a speech, Allen paused, then began referring to Sidarth:


“
This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent. He's following us around everywhere. And it's just great. We're going to places all over Virginia, and he's having it on film and it's great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because he's never been there and probably will never come. [...] Let's give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.[2]
”


According to Sidarth, he was the only non-white person present among the crowd of 100 or so Republican supporters, some of whom applauded Allen's remarks.[2]
The Webb campaign accused Allen of using a racial insult; macaca has been identified as a Francophone epithet for North African indigenes, and commentators have suggested that he may have heard the slur from his mother, Henrietta "Etty" Allen, who is a pied-noir, or North African (in Allen's case, a Tunisian) of French nationality.[3] During a televised debate on September 18, reporter Peggy Fox asked Allen if he had learned the slur from his mother; Etty Allen denied that she had ever used the word before.[4]
According to the Washington Post, Allen's campaign manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive. Allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to Sidarth, that he did not know what the word meant, and that he did not intend to insult Sidarth's ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd. "I do apologize if he's offended by that," Allen said, adding that "I would never want to demean him as an individual."[2]
Shortly after, Allen's campaign held that he used the word in reference to Sidarth's hairstyle. Although Sidarth was wearing a baseball cap on the day of the incident,[5] he had been conversing casually with Allen's aides during campaign stops before the incident.[6] Allen's campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as "Mohawk".[2] A now widely disseminated photo of Sidarth,[7] hosted by the Webb campaign, shows Sidarth's hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides, typical of a mohawk.
On August 15, 2006, John Reid, Allen's communications director, told the New York Times that members of Allen's campaign had "good-naturedly" nicknamed Sidarth "Mohawk" when speaking among themselves, but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca.[8] Reid told the Times that Sidarth only received a nickname from Allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name. Interviewed that day on CNN, however, Sidarth recalled shaking Allen's hand earlier in the week and giving his name. "He's very good with names, legendarily. He tries very hard to remember peoples' names when meeting them," Sidarth said. As for the macaca remark, "I am disappointed that someone like a Senator of the United States could use something [so] completely offensive."[9]
On August 16, 2006, the National Journal reported that two Virginia Republicans who heard the word used by Allen's campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca, Spanish and French slang for excrement. The National Journal quoted a Republican close to the campaign saying, "In other words, [Sidarth] was a shit-head, an annoyance."[10]
By August 20, 2006, Allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word, and that he simply made it up, contrary to original explanations from Allen and his staff.[11][12][13]
After several public apologies, Allen called Sidarth twelve days after the incident, on August 23, to apologize directly for his remarks. Allen's campaign manager Dick Wadhams has continued to blame opponent Webb, the media, and Allen's "leftist" foes for a "feeding frenzy."[14] The incident reduced Allen's once-broad polling margin over Webb to single digits.[15]
On September 19, John Podhoretz used the name "Felix Macacawitz" as a headline for a post in the National Review blog "The Corner".[16] On October 4, Weed for Congress field organizer Meryl Ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of Weed.[17]
Some political observers believe the incident shows an early-21st-century shift in American politics. Salon.com named Sidarth its 2006 Person of the Year. Michael Scherer wrote, "Sidarth was the kid next door. He, not Allen, was the real Virginian. He was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the GOP's solid South and toward a day when Allen's act will be a tacky antique. Allen was the past, Sidarth is the wired, diverse future -- of Virginia, the political process and the country." [18]
Relating to the Allen controversy, "Macaca" was named the most politically incorrect word of 2006 on December 15 by Global Language Monitor, a nonprofit group that studies word usage.[19]
Despite his initial offense at the term, Sidarth later embraced it in a Washington Post opinion piece titled "I Am Macaca".[20] Weeks following Allen's comment, Sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a Larry Sabato-taught class at the University of Virginia of only three words: "I am macaca".[21]
Webb's Reagan ad[edit]
On September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement.[22] It featured footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan praising Webb at the secretary's alma mater, the United States Naval Academy in 1985.
The next day, an official working for the Reagan Presidential Foundation faxed a letter to Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement.[23] In response, Webb told reporters that if Ronald Reagan had made any speeches about Allen his opponent's campaign would probably use them, too. "I would encourage them to try to go find some."[24]
The Webb advertisement also aired in Norfolk, Roanoke, and Northern Virginia.
The Reagan Library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former president's image. In 2004, it criticized the conservative Club for Growth for an advertisement comparing George W. Bush to Reagan.[25]
On September 15, 2006, a Washington Post editorial supported Webb's advertisement and chided the Allen campaign for crying foul, saying that neither protest by Allen's campaign or Reagan's Library (later corrected to the Reagan Presidential Foundation) has any merit:


“
The president is a public official, paid by the taxpayers. His speeches are in the public domain; they belong to all Americans, and to history. His words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come, but they should not be censored posthumously. In this instance, Mr. Webb has neither distorted Mr. Reagan's words nor taken them out of context; nor did Mr. Reagan ever repudiate them.[23]
”


Allen at Fairfax County Republican Committee's ethnic rally[edit]
On September 9, 2006, Allen attended, along with other Republican elected officials and candidates for public office, an "ethnic community rally" at Thomas Edison High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. The Fairfax County Republican Committee, together with several ethnically-based Republican groups, had sponsored this event for the past several years. Participating organizations included local Republican groups drawn from the Asian American, African American, and Hispanic American communities, among others. A small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school, including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to Allen's macaca remark. One protester said she was there "to let him [George Allen] know that racism is not acceptable", while another protester suggested that Allen was "holding a fake diversity rally".[26]
Both Allen and Webb's supporters video-recorded the event. Webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than non-white.[27] The Virginian-Pilot described the crowd as chiefly Asian-American. Webb, according to exit polls, went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly, including Asian-Americans.[28]
Webb's stance on women in combat[edit]




Jim Webb at a rally, c. September 20, 2006


On September 13, 2006, five female graduates of the United States Naval Academy had a press conference promoted by the Allen campaign to assail a Washingtonian article Webb wrote in 1979. They accuse Webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy. In the article, entitled "Women Can't Fight", Webb described his personal experiences in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Marine infantry officer, and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women. Webb also wrote that he had never met a woman "whom [he] would trust to provide those men with combat leadership". The article also characterized the Naval Academy dormitory situation as "a horny woman's dream", due to the ratio of men to women being 13⅓ to 1 at the time.
The five women, who attended the Naval Academy from the late 1970s to early 1980s, asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them. Some even went so far as to wear "Jim Webb Fan Club" t-shirts.
In response to the allegations, Webb's campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country, and the tone of this article was no exception. He added that he is "completely comfortable" with the present roles of women within the Naval Academy and the modern military. Webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects, "and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the Academy or the active Armed Forces to undue hardship, I remain profoundly sorry."[29]
Allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the Virginia Military Institute. Allen remarked in 2000 that women "should not be in foxholes", and that "[t]he purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment".[30] A 2000 candidate-guide published by the Virginian-Pilot reiterated this stance of Allen's.[31]
Allen's remarks about his Jewish heritage[edit]
In the wake of the Macaca controversy, the Jewish periodical The Forward reported that in all likelihood, Allen's mother Etty Allen, née Henrietta Lumbroso, was Jewish "from the august Sephardic Jewish Lumbroso family",[32] and that therefore by the Jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent, Allen himself would be considered Jewish.
On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated each other at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.[33] One of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: "It has been reported [that] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for "making aspersions" and responded: "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her."[34][35] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read:


“
I was raised as a Christian and my mother was raised as a Christian. And I embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage, including my Lumbroso family line’s Jewish heritage, which I learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed.[36]
”


Allen also told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a reference to kosher dieting, "I still had a ham sandwich for lunch. And my mother made great pork chops."[37] The Washington Post reported that Allen's mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public, and had originally asked Allen to keep that information private.[38] Although no mention is made of her mother's religion in Allen's sister's book, she does mention that the Catholic Church, before marrying the couple, required Allen's parents to agree that any children would be raised Catholic, and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a Jewish friend.[32]
PAC ad on Allen's body armor vote[edit]
In mid-September, VoteVets.org, a political action committee formed in 2006 that is primarily composed of former Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and headed by Jon Soltz, released a television advertisement criticizing Allen for voting against body armor for US troops in 2003.[39] The claim was based on Allen's vote against a Democratic amendment that would have increased National Guard funding for body armor.
Various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim. The Arizona Republic ran a piece headlined "VoteVets ad is pure deceit."[40] FactCheck.org said the ad contained "false claims."[41] But Media Matters for America said Allen voted against troop body armor not once, but twice.[42]
In March 2003, Allen voted against a bill that "targets shortfalls identified by the National Guard and Reserve in their Unfunded Requirement lists," including the shortage of helmets, tents, bullet-proof inserts, and tactical vests.[42] On October 2, 2003, Allen voted against a Democratic amendment by Senator Christopher Dodd to add $322 million to the $300 million (for body armor and battlefield cleanup) that the Senate Appropriations Committee had already attached to an $87 billion emergency supplemental bill.[42]
Allen's use of racial epithets[edit]
Salon published a story in late September reporting that three of Allen's former college football teammates said that during the 1970s, Allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks.[43] On September 29, Edward Sabornie, a professor at North Carolina State University who had been in Allen's class and played football with him, decided to go on record with his allegations. Sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in Salon's previous article about Allen's use of the slur. In that article, he was described as a "white teammate" and commented that using racial epithets "was so common with George when he was among his white friends. [It was] the terminology he used." Sabornie also recalled Allen as having referred to blacks as "roaches" and Latinos as "wetbacks".[44]
Following the first Salon article, pundit Larry Sabato, who attended the University of Virginia at the same time as Allen, stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that Allen used the epithet. Sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else.[45] Allen called the claims "ludicrously false", explaining, "[t]he story and [Shelton's] comments and assertions in [the claim] are completely false. I don't remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary."[46]
Sons of Confederate Veterans[edit]
On September 28, 2006 the Sons of Confederate Veterans criticized Allen when the group claimed Allen criticized Southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the Confederate Battle flag had negative racial overtones.[47]
Webb's use of racial epithets[edit]
In late September, Webb was asked if he had ever used the word "nigger". Webb replied that "I don't think that there's anyone who grew up around the South that hasn't had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life." Webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in Fields of Fire, a novel Webb wrote about the Vietnam War.[48]
Allen campaign officials referred reporters to Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb and members of his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, "point the rifles at them [black people], pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and do that kind of thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I would never do that. I would never want to do that." Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.[49]
An October 18, 2006, article in the Washington Post quotes a recent interview with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. If you write that word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, I use it defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".[50]
Allen's undisclosed business interests[edit]
On October 8, 2006, the Associated Press, reviewing five years of Allen's financial records, reported that Allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts, and contacted the Army to help a company in which he has an interest.[51] Allen's staff said Allen believed in "good faith" that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value.
Following the AP report, Allen asked the Senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options. The ethics committee ruled than Allen was not required to disclose his stock options, and did not err in not doing so.[52]
Webb's name truncated on ballots[edit]
On October 24, 2006, the Washington Post reported that Webb's last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in Alexandria, Falls Church and Charlottesville. Webb's name should have appeared as James H. 'Jim' Webb but only James H. 'Jim' showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the InterCivic voting machines. Allen's name George F. Allen was not affected by this glitch. The Virginia State Board of Elections pledged to have it fixed by the 2007 statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error.[53]
Sexually explicit passages from Webb novels[edit]
On October 26, 2006, the Drudge Report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from Webb's novels. One excerpt involved a man placing his son's penis in his mouth; others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women. The press release, which the Drudge Report attributed to the Allen campaign, said the passages fit "a continued pattern of demeaning women" in which Webb "refuse[s] to portray women in a respectful, positive light".[54] Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, WTOP-FM, whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.[55]
In a radio interview on October 27, 2006, Webb described the Allen campaign's tactics as "smear after smear", and called the attack on his fiction baseless "character assassination". Webb defended his fiction work, saying that "the duty of a writer is to illuminate [his] surroundings". He said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a Bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist[56] and that it was "not a sexual act".[57]
Responding to the controversy, Allen stated: "My record as a United States senator is an open book. My opponent has a record as well. He, in his advertisements, points out that he's an author, that he's a writer of books. That's part of his record. These passages in his books are part of his open record. I'll let the people of Virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with."[58]
At a campaign rally in Annandale on October 28, 2006, Webb noted that his novel Fields of Fire has been on the Commandant of the Marine Corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the "most-taught piece of literature regarding the Vietnam War" on college campuses.[58] Webb further listed the various accolades his books have received.[59]
Allen's arrest warrant records[edit]
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has criticized Allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in 1974.[60]
Allen supporters attack blogger[edit]
On October 31, footage of multiple Allen supporters attacking a constituent, Mike Stark, during a campaign stop in Charlottesville, Virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources.[61] Stark, a liberal blogger, Marine veteran and law student, attempted to ask Allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers. After yelling out a question about rumors of Allen having assaulted his first wife, Stark was "briefly placed in a headlock, restrained, slung to the ground, and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three Allen supporters".[62] Stark was detained several days later at another rally after an Allen supporter claimed Stark pushed him to the ground.[63]
Telephone intimidation[edit]
The FBI launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential Democratic voters in eight counties before the poll, by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted, a classic example of voter suppression.[64]

Product Types
Have a pond, water feature or just looking to create one? We have all the products and knowledge to make you successful at building, maintaining and enjoying your water gardens, koi ponds, water features and pondless waterfalls. Offering a complete selection of liner, pumps, filters, aeration, treatments, fish food, lighting, and much more! 








Accessories
Need an education on water garden construction or pond plants? We have a full line of books to choose from. Need a fake stone or blue heron decoy? You'll find it here. How about a decorative floating duckling or alligator? We have those as well!






Aeration
Aeration is an extremely important piece of a healthy ecosystem for your koi & goldfish. Oxygen levels can fluctuate drastically which can directly affect the health of your fish. With our complete selection of aerators and aeration systems it's hard not to find one to fit your application.






Algae Control
With fish waste, uneaten fish food, sunlight, and the right temperature, algae can quickly get out of control in your pond. Between pea soup green water to string algae in your waterfall, we have the treatments to get your pond back on track. The majority of these treatments will kill the algae for a quick fix, but they will not prevent regrowth. Once the algae is treated, use proactive products such as beneficial bacteria to reduce future growth.






Aqua Meds Products
Our complete selection of Aqua-Meds pond treatments and antibiotics will help remedy flukes, fungus, parasites, bacterial issues, and other common diseases that can harm your fish population.






Decorative Water Features
Add a unique touch to your outdoor living space with these decorative features. Choose from container water gardens, stand-alone fountains, bubbling stone and decorative spitters. Most can easily be installed in an existing system.






Fall & Winter Pond Supplies
Being proactive during the fall and winter will ensure a healthier pond ecosystem come spring. We carry everything you need to make sure those necessary steps are taken. Whether it's food, netting, bacteria or deicers, you'll find it here.






Filters
To support aquatic life, every pond will require some level of filtration. There are mainly two types- mechanical and biological. Through both forms, the pond will process a variety of nutrients in the pond, including fish waste, uneaten fish food and accumulated debris. Whether choosing from an external or submersible, pressurized or gravity fed system- selecting the right filter for your pond should not be underestimated. 






Filter Pads & Replacement Parts
Nothing lasts forever. Filter pads and individual components on your pump and filtration system will eventually need to be replaced. You'll find everything you need here. From filter mats, leaf nets for the skimmer, replacement impellers, and more.






Fish Food
Fish, like all animals, need food to survive. Our premium selection of fish food for koi and goldfish covers all major brands including Microbe-Lift, Hikari, Tetra, Blue Ridge, Dainichi, API, Aquascape, and more! We even carry Cichlid and Turtle food. Available in soft sticks, pellets, floating, and sinking foods for spring, summer and fall feeding. 








Fish Medications
The immune systems in fish can weaken from stress, environmental factors and poor nutrition, making them susceptible to common fish diseases. You'll find all the necessary treatments for these bacterial and parasitic diseases below. The majority of these diseases can be prevented with routine maintenance such as partial water changes, water testing, and of course population control.








Fountain Supplies
Find all your fountain supplies here. From small tabletop fountain pumps to large floating fountains, maintenance liquids and tablets, leveling shims, fountain heads, lighting and more. 








Gift Certificates
Not sure what to get the pond enthusiast in your family? Everyone loves a gift certificate from Webb's Water Gardens. Gift certificates never expire and can be used for any item.






Kits - Complete Pond
Constructing a pond can definitely be confusing at times. These kits come with all the necessary components to build a complete pond with professional results. Take the guesswork out of purchasing essential components separately with these integrated kits.






Kits - Pondless Waterfall
Pondless Waterfall Kits make below ground reservoir construction simpler, easier and more reliable. Sturdy pump vaults and water matrix blocks create underground reservoirs that are stronger and safer than ever before. These kits come with all necessary components to eliminate guesswork and material runs, saving you time and money.






Live Fish
Quality Koi fish delivered to your door! These beautiful fish can easily reach 36" in length and are available in a variety of patterns and colors.






Microbe Lift Products
Specializing in the development and production of natural microbial products for the treatment of environmental issues associated with the various uses of water. Microbe Lift products are the most sought after product for water quality, clarity and overall fish and pond maintenance. Here you'll find a wide variety of products such as bacteria, fish food, barley, and fish treatments.






Nets & Netting
To remove debris and prevent debris from entering your pond, cover netting and handled nets are a must for any pond owner. We offer a wide selection of netting, fish and skimmer nets for the most conscious of all pond owners.






Planting Supplies & Fertilizers
Plants are an essential component in all ponds. Not only creating beauty, but also helping to maintain an overall balanced ecosystem. We offer a complete line of products you'll need to grow and maintain healthy aquatic plants.






Pond Liner & Underlay
We carry a full line of flexible 45 mil EPDM pond liner and installation products to create the perfect pond or water feature. From large commercial ponds to small water gardens you'll find the perfect installation and repair products here. 






Pumps
Our premium quality selection of submersible pond pumps for waterfall or filtration applications includes energy efficient, economical and high volume pumps. Our water garden pumps are direct driven or magnetically driven to suit any application.






Skimmers for Ponds
Designed to remove surface debris before it sinks, skimmers eliminate water quality problems and reduce maintenance. Because skimmers remove debris before it reaches the pump, they acts as a pre-filtration reducing pump maintenance. They also provide quick and easy access to the pump. Most include a leaf basket or net, filter brushes or filter pad(s). 






Spillways and Weirs
Ideal for use at beginning of streams and waterfalls, in block walls, pools and formal fountains. These spillways and weirs are the perfect choice for when a cascade of water is desired. Need a reservoir, basin or a complete kit? We have those as well.






Test Kits
Testing the chemistry of your pond water is important to ensure it's clean, clear and healthy. Use test kits and test strips regularly to monitor healthy conditions for your fish.






Treatments
Offering an extensive line of water treatments that will keep your pond healthy and clear for years to come. We make it easy to choose and maintain a healthy, balanced water garden. Natural biological treatments, chemical algaecides and clarifiers, salt, and mosquito control are all available. Whatever your maintenance needs, Webb's has you covered.






Tubing, Bottom Drains, Fittings
Whether you're a do-it-yourselfer or professional contractor, you'll find the necessary components for a successful installation here. Tubing, fittings, drains and waterfall foam are available. 






Underwater Lighting
In today's busy world, it's often difficult to enjoy your pond during the day. Underwater lighting changes all that, extending viewing hours after the sun goes down. Choose from economical halogen options or the newest technology LED lighting- available in both underwater or open air units. We have a large selection of spotlights, waterfall and accent lights as well as transformers, timers, photocells and related accessories.






UV Clarifiers and Ionizers
Effectively eliminate green water without the use of chemicals. UV clarifiers are a proven dependable and effective method of controlling algae and harmful bacteria without leaving any residuals in the water. Use an electronic IonGen system to not only control green water but also string algae. 






Vacuums & Maintenance
Over the course of a season, your pond will accumulate debris and organics such as leaves, grass clippings, uneaten fish food, and fish waste. The filtration system should remove most of this debris, but the rest will break down into muck and sludge. Periodic cleanings and general maintenance are inevitable. You'll find a complete line of vacuums and heavy duty gloves for maintenance.

If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you. After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online, such as yellowpages.com. You can check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.Why should I hire a lawyer?If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, or you need help to navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. Also, during times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you might need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available.What can I have an attorney do for me?When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.

You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship.
The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.
You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Ask as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle.
How much will an attorney cost?You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant. Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Can I ask an attorney about past cases they worked on?You can ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases. You should check their office for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You can also ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.What does a family lawyer do?Family attorneys deal with personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork, such as adoption or inheritance documents.What does a divorce attorney do?Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.What does a personal injury lawyer do?When you're hurt by an outside party, and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.What does a civil attorney do?If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.What does a bankruptcy lawyer do?A bankruptcy lawyer can help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.See more Tips & AdviceSponsoredBlahnik Law Office16180 Hastings Ave SE Ste 201, Prior Lake, MN 55372(952) 204-7978Helping You Through Difficult TimesWebsiteSee Our ServicesDirectionsMore InfoBachelani Law Office(1)8609 Lyndale Ave S Ste 209d, Minneapolis, MN 55420(952) 204-7977Minnesota Family Law AttorneyWebsiteContact UsDirectionsMore InfoGregory J.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
