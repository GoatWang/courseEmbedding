Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
