Where?My current locationSearchHomeWeston, WVJamieWeston, WV JamieAbout Search ResultsAbout Search ResultsYP - The Real Yellow PagesSM - helps you find the right local businesses to meet your specific needs. Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Jamie Marcus Miller1 Amalia DrBuckhannon, WV 26201(304) 473-2063No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Sustakoski, Jamie L700 Oakmound RdClarksburg, WV 26301(304) 623-6330Nurses-Advanced Practice-ARNPNursesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Dr. Jamie M Day, DDS, MS106 Cambridge PlBridgeport, WV 26330(304) 842-6333DentistsEndodontistsBusinesses in related categories to Air Conditioning Service & RepairAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collectionPREFERRED4. Sears Home Improvements - Air Conditioning Service & RepairFind a Location(888) 950-7276Air Conditioning Service & RepairWebsiteSee Special OffersYP AdVideoMore InfoFrom Business: Whether your current central heating & air conditioning system needs preventive maintenance, repair, or replacement, trust Sears to keep your family comfortable y…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collectionPREFERRED5. Sears Home Improvements - Heating Equipment & Systems-RepairingFind a Location(888) 950-7276Heating Equipment & Systems-RepairingWebsiteSee Special OffersYP AdVideoMore InfoFrom Business: Sears Home Improvements is your trusted, long term partner.
