DAS Antennas


 
PCTEL’s indoor and outdoor antennas for DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems) allow carriers to increase capacity and deploy new spectrum in zoning challenged locations. Various frequency band models covering 4G LTE, Cellular, PCS and Wi-Fi spectrums are available, and several mounting options provide added installation flexibility.

Coaxial Cable Products


 
PCTEL is a leading supplier of premium coaxial cable solutions, from bulk reel offerings to customized cable assemblies. Our low loss Foam Polyethylene (PFP) RF cables come in most diameters to meet a variety of installation needs. Ultra-flexible varieties are available for the most demanding installation scenarios. PCTEL's PFP cable assembly line includes a wide range of connectors, splitters, combiners, and adapters that can be ordered with custom labeling and durable jacket printing.





Custom RF Cable Assemblies



PCTEL offers a wide range of high quality RF coaxial cable assemblies and RF connector options for the broadband access, public safety, wireless carrier, fleet management, rail/PTC (Positive Train Control), industrial wireless, and utility markets. PCTEL features full configuration options on cable length and connector type. Our PFP and PFP Ultra Flexible cable is available in sizes from PFP100 to PFP600. PFP Ultra Flexible cable is built for installations that require an increased bend radius.







Connectors and Adapters for RF Cable



PCTEL offers high performance RF connectors and adapters for public and private telecommunications needs, including broadband access, public safety, wireless carrier, fleet management, rail/PTC (Positive Train Control), industrial wireless, and utilities. PCTEL�s coaxial connector portfolio features a broad range of SMA, TNC, BNC, MCX, MMCX, FME, N type and other connectors and adapters for a wide range of cable sizes. All of PCTEL�s RF connectors and adapters are fully tested and qualified for frequency ranges up to 5.8 GHz.







Splitters and Combiners for RF Cable



PCTEL�s carrier grade line of splitters and combiners for RF signal distribution support the effective transmission of cellular and GPS signals at macro and small cell sites. Splitters, also known as power dividers, are commonly used to split a transmission signal to multiple coverage areas (namely 2, 3, 4, or 8-ways) from a single radio. Splitters can also be used with PCTEL GPS timing antennas to synchronize equipment operating the network. Combiners are commonly used to combine multiple antenna inputs from users into a single coaxial transmission line to the BTS (Base Transceiver Station).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

A



Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
