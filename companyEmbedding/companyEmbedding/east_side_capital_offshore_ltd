HILLARY SERVER-GATE COVERED UP BY FBI DIRECTORS





Offshore hedge funds feed payola to Hillary and run the FBI
Contributing Writers | Opinion | AMERICANS FOR INNOVATION  | Apr. 01, 2016, Updated Apr. 05, 2016 | PDF


Fig. 1 – James B. Comey. FBI director since 2013 when he replaced 12-year director Robert S. Mueller. Mueller was chief counsel for London-based bank HSBC, exposed in 2015 for sheltering $100 billion in client funds in murky offshore tax havens populated by drug dealers, money launderers and arms traffickers. Comey also served as chief counsel for Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world. In 2012, Comey's Bridgewater salary was $6,632,616 just before taking over the helm at the FBI. In his first year at the FBI, he received another $3.3 million in Bridgewater severance cash outs. Others might call it payola from his Cartel buds. A year later, his net worth jumped up to $34 million. Comey is either the best lawyer ever, or he keeps secrets from the American people. With such exclusive Cartel relationships nurtured by Hillary and Bill, it is highly doubtful Comey will actually move against Hillary Clinton for abusing national security on her personal server. 
Photo: HuffPost.

(Apr. 01, 2016)—The FBI and Justice Department have stubbornly refused to prosecute heinous criminal acts of the Obama Administration. They include Benghazi, Fast and Furious gun running, Hillary’s private server, 2008 bank bailout, social networking patent theft, illegal NSA snooping, energy company subsidies, IRS targeting of conservatives, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) confiscations, baby parts trafficking, LIBOR rigging, open borders, overstayed visas of more than one million people, religious persecution and so on.
Now we know why 
The current and former FBI directors are members of a dangerous Cartel whose agenda is a self-styled New World Order.
For new readers, the “Cartel” is a group of about 200 known bankers, lawyers, politicians, bureaucrats, technologists and judges, both Republicans and Democrats, who are deeply invested in one another through relationships, stocks and mutual funds. This group is currently attempting to seize control of global information data flow. Their agenda is defined by A New World Order doctrine. See below.
A light was shined on the FBI director when it was discovered that former FBI director, Robert S. Mueller, III  (2001-2013), recommended Obama’s Supreme Court recent nominee, Merrick B. Garland, to be circuit judge for the District of Columbia in 1995. 
 New World Order proponents, like hedge fund billionaire, George Soros, and former Hillary Clinton political adviser, Anne-Marie Slaughter, call it A New World Order. The rest of us call it plain old greed and lust for power in new clothes.
We are approaching a Point of No Return: A digital world controlled by spies & power-mongers
The quantum difference from past attempts by power-brokers to rewrite history is the ubiquity of the digital world. In our new digital world, information is more valuable than gold. 
Since about 1990, unscrupulous people in banking, technology, politics, intelligence and law compared notes and began joining forces to embed their power permanently while lining their pockets.
The AFI research below concludes:

FBI directors since 2001 have been tied at the hip to a Cartel that promotes a new world order. The current FBI director James B. Comey (2013-current), and former director Robert S Mueller (2001-2013) have numerous financial holdings and relationships that tie them unmistakably to this group.
The net worth of FBI directors since 2001 have skyrocketed during the Great Recession:



Comey’s from $206,000 in 2002 to up to $33.5 million in 2012 ($3.33 million increase per year)
Mueller’s from $1.8 million in 2001 to $7.0 million in 2011 ($520,000 increase per year)



FBI directors since 2001 have enjoyed exclusive hedge fund holdings not open to average Americans:



Comey was paid a $6,632,616 salary in 2012 by Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, then another $3,235,654 when he left Bridgewater to become FBI director.
Comey was general counsel for London bank HSBC which was caught sheltering $100 billion in dubious client funds in murky offshore accounts.
Mueller held two exclusive hedge fund investments run by Bank of New York with at least 36% of the funds' assets run out of the Cayman Islands. One fund, Defenders Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund LLC (one of four names the fund had), was closely associated with Ponzi schemers including Bernie Madoff. Mueller’s fund was fined $200 million by the SEC for funneling clients to Bernie Madoff.



Commercial Power-Mongers: FBI directors since 2001 are tied intimately with the IBM Eclipse Foundation and the theft of Leader Technologies’ social networking invention. (The now familiar cast of characters are: IBM, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorgan, GE, Morgan Stanley, Qualcomm, HP, Vanguard, Fidelity, Cisco, Wind River, Eurotech SpA, Xerox, Oracle, SAP, Wells Fargo, Intel, HSBC, Lockheed Martin, etc.)
Current FBI director Comey, who was general counsel at Lockheed Martin, is and has been active IBM Eclipse member. Therefore, Comey and Lockheed were complicit in the theft of social networking, perhaps the most important invention since the light bulb.
In 2012, Comey held up to $100,000 stock in BHP Billiton Ltd. ADR, an Australian ore producer, including uranium. On Jun. 20, 2012, Bill Clinton was paid $175,000 by BHP Billiton for a speech in New York. Just coincidence?
On Sep. 06, 2005, Bill Clinton brokered a UrAsia uranium mining deal in Kazakhstan that netted The Clinton Foundation $152 million in “donations” and $1 million in Goldman Sachs fees, the broker of that uranium deal.

Clinton and Comey interests are inseparable
Comey, Clinton and FBI interests could not be more tightly aligned.
The FBI directors and Justice Department senior Attorneys General have been protecting Obama’s, the Clintons’ and the Cartel’s objectives for going on two decades. This protection extends to other members of the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations. 
The former Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. was an evident Cartel plant. He did not prosecute any of this criminality. Holder bought the judges in Leader v. Facebook and aided the theft of social networking from Leader Technologies because the Cartel wanted to use it to consolidate their power and control.
The current Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, is also a Cartel patsy. She will follow orders dutifully. 
So the question of whether Hillary will get out of her email server problem is up to Comey, who will pass it to Lynch, who will likely find a way to punt. This gaggle of attorneys has taken the art of misdirection to new heights.
Hillary is Comey’s “godmother”
Judging from James B. Comey’s investments and relationships, the zebra will not change its stripes. 
As a result, Comey and Loretta Lynch will very likely fabricate a way to protect Hillary in a tangle of interlocking and indecipherable legal machinations. 
After all, Hillary and Bill are Mueller’s and Comey’s "godparents."
[As this post went to press, the State Department suspended its review of Hillary's possession of top secret emails on her private server. Citing the FBI investigation as the reason, we are suspicious of misdirection. With this suspended review, the State Department has created the opportunity for the FBI to kick the can back to the State Department "hypothetically: to complete their investigations before making a recommendation for or against indictment." It will all sound very reasonable. Remember, these people are all attorneys skilled in deception.]
Latest name for corruption: “Public-private partnerships”
The latest smokescreen for this new world order agenda is “public-private partnerships.” When you hear that, grab your wallet and your privacy.

George Soros
Anne-Marie Slaughter
The "patron saint" of “public-private partnerships” in the Obama Administration is Anne-Marie Slaughter. Slaughter served as a Hillary Clinton senior political adviser at the State Department (2009-2011). Slaughter published A New World Order and is related to her new world order mentor George Soros by marriage.  Much of what we know about Slaughter's relationship to Hillary comes from Judicial Watch’s FOIA releases from Hillary Clinton’s private email server.
Slaughter famously encouraged Obama and Clinton to “harness private incentives to public goals.” To some, this sounds like German Fascism where Adolf Hitler did not nationalize industries that supported his policies. On the other hand, Jewish businesses and property were confiscated.
In other words, Obama and Clinton have used the power of their office to reward those who agree with them and punish those who don’t. 
This partisan policy has forsaken the American Republic. Instead of the process of compromise our Republic is suffering a wave of scandals including the bank bailout, energy company subsidies, Obamacare, IRS Tea Party targeting, BLM land rights confiscations, trafficking in baby body parts, LIBOR fixing, America Invents Act, Fast and Furious, Common Core, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), open borders, Islamic pandering, allowing/losing more than one million visa violators and attacks on religious values.
Why has the FBI failed to prosecute these evident crimes?
FBI operations are shrouded in secrecy. Uncovering illegal conduct within the FBI is a minefield where out-of-the-office discussion of top secret information generally lands you in prison and the victim of smear campaigns by the powers that be. 
An FBI run by honorable people keeping secrets is a good thing. However, an FBI run by money-grubbing, power-grabbing opportunists in the name of national security threatens the American Republic itself.
Follow the money
One of the few times the public gets a glimpse into the personal affairs of the FBI director is in their Senate confirmation hearing and their required annual financial disclosure. The rest of the time, these people just refuse to answer questions or stonewall, with a smile and condescending “trust us” words, or with belligerence (Hillary: "What difference does it make.").
Judge Merrick B. Garland’s nomination raised suspicion about the FBI’s impartiality

Judge Merrick B. Garland, Chief Judge, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (1995-current); Merrick's holdings increase from $3.5 up to $19.1 between 1995-2012. Most of this wealth increase occurred while Mueller directed the FBI.Robert S. Mueller, III
 Judge Garland’s 1995 Senate confirmation document included a letter of recommendation from Robert S. Mueller, then  Assistant Attorney General, later FBI Director (2001-2013).
Investigation into Mueller’s 2001 and 2011 financial disclosures revealed an astounding increase in net worth from $1.8 to $7.0 million. Cleverly buried in 233 entries were two hedge funds invested in almost $100 billion in hedge fund assets with at least 36% of them offshore in the Cayman Islands. 
Mueller hedge “funds of funds” hide many sins 
 Mueller held Defenders Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund LLC and Mellon Optima L/S Strategy Fund LLC. These “funds of funds” invest in other hedge funds with innocuous names like “Pershing Square” and Glenview Institutional Partners.” But as HSBC whistleblower Hervé Falciani revealed in 2015, many are secret havens for money laundering, arms trafficking and tax evasion. 
Mueller’s exclusive funds were not open to the general public. The minimum investment in several of the funds of funds is $10,000,000—MESSAGE: Great unwashed Americans do not qualify, but we'll make an exception for FBI director Mueller.
Mueller was evidently allowed into these funds by the Cartel to buy influence at the FBI. See previous post for more on this investigation.

Both Mueller hedge funds were managed by Mellon Bank of New York (BNY).
Ground Zero for Washington's poisoned well?
No less than ten (10) BNY directors were shared between Mueller’s Defenders and Mellon Optima funds. 
Ask Rodney.
He is secretly driving  your economic life. What? You didn't get the memo?!

Fig. 2—Rodney S. Yanker, Bank of New York (BNY), is an "outside director" for Bank of New York (BNY) hedge funds owned by FBI director Robert S. Mueller. No official photos are available. This photo was discovered on a reunion blog for his Tulane fraternity. Photo: BTP Tulane.
Laughably, these people were mostly designated “outside directors.” According to ethics laws, an outside director must have an “arm’s length” relationship to the company. One cannot be an "outside director" and be employed by the company also. This is a bad joke, a charade. Clearly these people care nothing about real ethics, they only make their actions look ethical to an unsuspecting outsider. Attorneys are especially adept at such deceptions. American regulators are obviously turning a blind eye for their friends. The system of accountability is broken.
These hedge fund disclosures are a charade of transparency. Are these people Ground Zero for the corruption that has poisoned the well in Washington, D.C.? Inquiring minds wonder. Few photos of these people are available, in fact, only two.

The incorporator of Mueller’s Defenders Fund was William P. Sauer. He had been sued two months earlier by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission for running two Ponzi schemes for which he eventually paid $5 million to settle.
Then, the fourth name for Mueller’s holding, Ivy Asset Management fed clients to Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and eventually paid $200 million to settle those complaints.
Tellingly, the FBI never prosecuted any of these BNY Ponzi schemers associated with Mueller's Defenders hedge fund.
Mueller’s replacement, James B. Comey, carries on the FBI hedge fund tradition
Counting his clerk job during University of Chicago Law School in 1982, Comey has held 15 jobs before becoming FBI director. He changed jobs every two years. Most employers would consider such job hopping a sign of instability, but in government legal circles, that makes you qualified to be FBI director. It appears that he was being groomed. See Bibliography below for a complete timeline of Comey's jobs.
James B. Comey’s  five most recent jobs were:

These disclosures prove that Comey is a card-carrying member of the IBM Eclipse Foundation and the NSA spy state machine.
New investigations into the financial holdings of Robert S. Mueller and James B. Comey reveal astounding conflicts of interest. These relationships  would have stopped any mere mortal from being offered the top law enforcement job.
Lockheed Patent Theft
Comey was general counsel to Lockheed Martin (09/2005-11/2010). This might not be notable except for the fact that Lockheed Martin was and is an active member of IBM’s Eclipse Foundation. 
IBM Eclipse has and is exploiting the social networking invention of Columbus innovator, Leader Technologies. As Lockheed General Counsel, Comey was either asleep at the general counsel wheel, or he participated in the theft of Leader’s important invention. In short, Comey aided and abetted the Great Financial Crime in the History of the World. 
Lockheed prosecutions for Leader Technologies’ social networking patent property theft have not occurred.
Bridgewater paid Comey $7.2 million in 2012
Comey’s financial disclosure for 2012 declared $7,200,595. That is $600,000 per month. Is any former U.S. Attorney worth such pay? What were they paying for? The likely answer is influence with the future FBI director.
Comey’s Bridgewater pay works out to $3,800 per hour for a 48 week year.  By comparison, $1,000 per hour is generally considered the highest attorney fee. Rates for salaried inside attorneys are generally half that, or less.
Comey also disclosed direct holdings (not counting portfolio holdings in his many mutual funds) in IBM Eclipse Foundation members: Verizon, Intel, Emerson Electric, Microsoft, Qualcomm, AT&T, Apple, HP, Morgan Stanley, Lockheed Martin, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo
These holdings are more proof that Comey carries water for the IBM Eclipse Foundation thieves of social networking and the NSA spy state machine.

FBI Director Comey was general counsel for this criminal HSBC operation before Barack Obama nominated him to be FBI director. Photo: ISIJ.
HSBC Trafficking
In addition to his $25 million stock portfolio, Comey came to HSBC from Bridgewater with a cool $5+ million in his pocket, with the promise of another $3+ million in "phantom stock" cash-out to come. Does any reasonable person believe he earned this money? Remember, in his 2003 Senate Confirmation Hearing, he declared his net worth at $206,000.
He was HSBC general counsel between Mar. 2013 and Sep. 2013. Seventeen months later, on Feb. 08, 2015, HSBC whistleblower Hervé Falciani tore the lid off of $100 billion in murky offshore private banking being sheltered by HSBC. Like Lockheed, unless Comey was asleep at the wheel as general counsel, he had to know about this misconduct.
The $100 billion in HSBC sheltering was occurring on Comey’s watch as general counsel at HSBC. Yet, no HDBC prosecutions are occurring.

NEW: Apr. 04, 2012— The Panama Papers blow the lid off more offshore illegalities run by Comey's HSBC, UBS and Credit Suisse (all Facebook underwriters).
Fig. 4— The Panama Papers released Apr. 03, 2016 by Fusion and ISIJ (The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists). Video: ICIJ.

NEW: Apr. 04, 2012— Comey's dirty Secrets. This is what a web of secret offshore and onshore shell companies looks like. HSBC, UBS and Credit Suisse figure prominently in these murky and often blatantly illegal structures.

Fig. 5— Visualization of The Panama Papers' Convoluted Structures. Mossack Fonseca is a large Panamanian law firm with offices in 40 countries likely run by the C.I.A. According to The Guardian (UK), they are the fourth largest offshore company provider. Their client files for the past 40 years have just been leaked to a German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Whenever one sees nested corporate structures so that the real owners are hidden, something nefarious is almost assuredly afoot. Sadly, the FBI, U.S. intelligence and "The Establishment" are scamming the American people through these offshore entities . . . in the name of national security, of course. Since DATE, Mossack Fonseca has set up 1,100 offshore companies for UBS and 2,300 for HSBC. Click here for background on Massack Fonseca by The Atlantic. Source: Fusion.
The Children of Israel had to make a choice between good and evil
In uncovering these dark secrets of ill-gotten gain, one is reminded of the Children of Israel's temptations surrounding the Golden Calf at Mount Sinai. Rather than uphold their faith and follow the laws of God, many chose to worship a Golden Calf. 
American culture is experiencing something similar, as evidenced by the behaviors described in this blog. What will happen to our country if we cannot soon separate the wicked from the righteous?

Since then, they’ve earned over $130 million. Where did the money come from? Most people assume that the Clintons amassed their wealth through lucrative book deals and high-six figure fees for speaking gigs. Now, Peter Schweizer shows who is really behind those enormous payments.In his New York Times bestselling books Extortion and Throw Them All Out, Schweizer detailed patterns of official corruption in Washington that led to congressional resignations and new ethics laws. In Clinton Cash, he follows the Clinton money trail, revealing the connection between their personal fortune, their “close personal friends,” the Clinton Foundation, foreign nations, and some of the highest ranks of government.Schweizer reveals the Clinton’s troubling dealings in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Haiti, and other places at the “wild west” fringe of the global economy. In this blockbuster exposé, Schweizer merely presents the troubling facts he’s uncovered. Meticulously researched and scrupulously sourced, filled with headline-making revelations, Clinton Cash raises serious questions of judgment, of possible indebtedness to an array of foreign interests, and ultimately, of fitness for high public office.ReplyDeletedave123April 6, 2016 at 6:13 PMHay Trump the answer to the TRICK question is: All men need to leave woman’s fucking virginal’s alone ReplyDeleteK.

PAY-to-PLAY NEW WORLD ORDERThis timeline shows how insiders sell access & manipulate politicians, police, intelligence, judges and media to keep their secrets
Clintons, Obamas, Summers were paid in cash for outlandish speaking fees and Foundation donations. Sycophant judges, politicians, academics, bureaucrats and media were fed tips to mutual funds tied to insider stocks like Facebook. Risk of public exposure, blackmail, pedophilia, “snuff parties” (ritual child sexual abuse and murder) and Satanism have ensured silence among pay-to-play beneficiaries. The U.S. Patent Office is their toy box.

STOP FACEBOOK PROPERTY THEFT


WILL HUMANKIND EVER LEARN? Facebook's Orwellian doublespeak about property and privacy (theft) merely repeats the eventual dehumanization of the individual under MAO's Red Star, Stalin's SOVIET Hammer & Cycle and Hitler's NAZI Swastika. Respect for the inalienable rights of each individual is a bedrock value of democracy. The members of the Facebook Cabal abuse this principle at every opportunity. They evidently believe that they deserve special privileges and are willing to lie, cheat and steal in order to treat themselves to these privileges.

America should not be in the business of cheating its entrepreneurial investors simply because the cheaters buy off judges with the money gained from their theft.

GIBSON DUNN LLP exposed as one of the most corrupt law firms in America


Investigative Reporter Julia Davis investigates Facebook's Leader v. Facebook attorney Gibson Dunn LLP. She credits this firm with the reason why not a single Wall Street banker has gone to jail since 2008. Click here  to read her article "Everybody hates whistleblowers." Examiner.com, Apr. 10, 2012. Here's an excerpt:"Skillful manipulation of the firm’s extensive media connections allows Gibson Dunn to promote their causes, while simultaneously smearing their opponents and silencing embarrassing news coverage."This statement followed right after Davis cited Facebook's chief inside counsel in the Leader v. Facebook case, Theodore Ullyot, who appears to have helped lead the Leader v. Facebook judicial corruption. Interesting word choices associated with Gibson Dunn LLP: manipulation, smear. Attorneys swear a solemn oath to act morally, ethically, and in support of democratic principles. They promise to conduct themselves in a manner than instills confidence among the citizenry in the rule of law and the judicial system. These promises appear to be meaningless.

EDITORIALS

DC Bar refuses to investigate attorney misconduct in Leader v. Facebook - Unwillingness of DC attorneys to self-police may explain why Washington is broken, Dec. 30, 2012Will the U.S. Supreme court support schemers or real American inventors? Facebook's case dangles on a doctored interrogatory. Eighteen (18) areas of question shout for attention, Dec. 27, 2012Two Policy Changes That Will Make America More Democratic (and less contentious), Dec. 21, 2012











OUR MISSION

American citizens must fight abuse of the constitutional right for authors and inventors to enjoy the fruits of their inventions, as a matter of matter of basic property rights and sound public policy. Otherwise, instead of innovation, creativity, genius, ideas, vision, courage,  entrepreneurship, respect, property, rejuvenation, morals, ethics, values, renewal, truth, facts, rights, privacy, solutions and judicial faithfulness,. . . our society and economy will be dragged down (and eventually destroyed) by copying, infringement, thievery, counterfeiting, hacking, greed, misinformation, exploitation, abuse, waste, disrespect, falsity, corruption, bribery, coercion, intimidation, doublespeak, misconduct, lies, deception, attorney "dark arts," destruction, confusion, dishonesty, judicial chicanery and lawlessness.If we do not speak up, impeach derelict judges and imprison corrupt attorneys, we cannot possibly hope to start fixing the current ills in our society. Without justice and respect for private property, democracy has no sure foundation.











CURRENT EDITORIAL FOCUS

We are an opinion blog that advocates for strong intellectual property rights. We welcome commenters and contributors. The Leader v. Facebook patent infringement case first came to our attention after learning that the trial judge, Leonard P. Stark, U.S. District Court of Delaware, ignored his jury’s admission that they had no evidence to support their on-sale bar verdict, but the judge supported it anyway. The judicial misconduct has deteriorated from there, replete with two of the three judges on the Federal Circuit appeal panel, Judges Alan D. Lourie and Kimberly A. Moore, holding Facebook stock that they did not disclose to the litigants, and later tried to excuse through a quick motion slipped in at the last minute by the Clerk of Court, Jan Horbaly, and his close friends at The Federal Circuit Bar Association. (The DC Bar subsequently revealed that Mr. Horbaly is not licensed to practice law in Washington D.C.) The judges ignored shocking new evidence that Mark Zuckerberg withheld 28 hard drives of 2003-2004 evidence from Leader Technologies that could prove actual theft (and therefore claims even more serious than infringement). In addition, Facebook's appeal attorney, Thomas G. Hungar of Gibson Dunn LLP, has close personal ties to just about every judicial player in this story. The misconduct appears to reach into the U.S. Patent Office through abuse of the reexamination process by Facebook. We will stay focused on Leader v. Facebook until justice is served, but we also welcome news and analysis of intellectual property abuse in other cases as well.

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR U.S. JUDGES

"CANON 2: A JUDGE SHOULD AVOID IMPROPRIETY AND THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY IN ALL ACTIVITIES"











GALLERY OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT




Judge Leonard P. Stark, U.S. District Court of Delaware, trial judge in Leader Techs, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc., 770 F. Supp. 2d 686 (D.Del. 2011). Judge Stark heard his jury foreman admit that the jury made the on-sale bar decision without any evidence other than speculation, and yet he supported that verdict anyway. Just months before trial, Judge Stark allowed Facebook to add the on-sale bar claim after the close of all fact discovery and blocked Leader from preparing its defenses to this new claim.







Judge Stark allowed the claims despite Leader's prophetic argument that the action would confuse the jury and prejudice Leader.  He also permitted the jury to ignore the Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc. test for on-sale bar, even after instructing the jury to use it. (See that Jury Instruction No. 4.7 here.) He also contradicted his own instruction to Leader to answer Interrogatory No. 9 in the present tense (2009), then permitted the jury to interpret it as a 2002 admission as well. Facebook's entire on-sale bar case is based upon this interrogatory. (Editorial: Hardly sufficient to meet the "heavy burden" of the clear and convincing evidence standard.) 


Judge Alan D. Lourie, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, panel judge in Leader Techs v. Facebook, Inc., 678 F.3d 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Judge Lourie stood to benefit financially from undisclosed holdings in Facebook. See analysis of Judge Lourie's T. Rowe Price holdings re. the Facebook IPO.  Judge Lourie also failed to apply his own law-test in Group One v. Hallmark Cards to the evidence. After debunking all of Facebook's evidence on appeal, Judge Lourie created new argument in the secrecy of chambers to support Facebook and prevent the on-sale bar verdict from being overturned—a clear breach of constitutional due process. 


Judge Kimberly A. Moore, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, panel judge in Leader Techs v. Facebook, Inc., 678 F.3d 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Judge Moore stood to benefit financially from undisclosed holdings in Facebook. See disclosure of substantial holdings in Facebook and Facebook-related stocks.  Judge Moore failed to follow the long-held precedent for testing on-sale bar evidence in Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc.—an evident and intentional omission coming from a former patent law professor. After debunking all of Facebook's evidence on appeal, Judge Moore created new argument in the secrecy of chambers to support Facebook and prevent the on-sale bar verdict from being overturned—a clear breach of constitutional due process. 


Judge Evan J. Wallach, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, member of the three-judge panel in Leader Techs v. Facebook, Inc., 678 F.3d 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Judge Wallach is not a patent attorney. This begs the question as to why a judge with no knowledge of patent law was assigned to the case. Would anyone ask a dentist to perform brain surgery? The Federal Circuit was specially formed to appoint patent-knowledgeable judges to patent cases.





There is no evidence so far in the judicial disclosures that Judge Wallach holds stock in Facebook, although when he was asked on a motion to disclose potential Facebook holdings and other conflicts of interest, he refused along with the other judges. See Motion to Disclose Conflicts of Interest.





Judge Wallach continued in silence even after Clerk of Court Horbaly failed to provide him with Dr. Lakshmi Arunachalam’s motions (according to his Federal Circuit staffer Valeri White), and yet the Clerk signed an order regarding that motion on Judge Wallach’s behalf. See a full analysis of these events at Donna Kline Now! Judge Wallach also failed to police his court’s violation of Leader’s Fifth and 14th Amendment constitutional right to due process when he participated in the fabrication of new arguments and evidence for Facebook in the secrecy of judge's chambers after he had just invalidated Facebook’s sole remaining item of evidence (using disbelieved testimony as ostensible evidence of an opposite).





Judge Wallach also failed to police his court when he failed to apply the Supreme Court's Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc. test for on-sale bar evidence, which included even the Federal Circuit’s own Group One v. Hallmark Cards, Inc. test—a test which Judge Lourie should have advised Judge Wallach to follow since Judge Lourie helped write that opinion. Group One test omission analysis.
 


Clerk of Court Jan Horbaly, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, clerk who signed all the opinions in Leader Techs v. Facebook, Inc., 678 F.3d 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Clerk Horbaly and his staff obfuscated when the court's ruling was challenged by an amicus curiae brief revealing clear mistakes of law and new evidence. See analysis of the misconduct and misrepresentations within the Federal Circuit Clerk of Court in Leader v. Facebook.


Mr. Horbaly failed to disclose his conflicts of interest and close associations with numerous Facebook attorneys and law firms, as well as his close association with one of Facebook's largest shareholders, Microsoft, who is a Director of The Federal Circuit Bar Association where Mr. Horbaly is an ex officio officer. Additionally, the DC Bar revealed in a written statement that Clerk Horbaly is not licensed to practice law in the District of Columbia. [Editorial: What does that make the Federal Circuit with its location within in a stone's throw of the White House? A self-governing state?] 


Judge Randall R. Rader, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, chief judge responsible for the (mis)conduct of his judges and  Clerk of Court in Leader Techs v. Facebook, Inc., 678 F.3d 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Judge Rader failed to manage his court resulting in a likely situation where his judges never even received briefs that they allegedly ruled on in favor of Facebook. Judge Rader also failed to disclose his conflicting relationships with a Leader principle with whom he may have had deep professional differences during his time at the Senate Judiciary Committee—his former professor of law at George Washington University Law Center, former Leader director Professor James P. Chandler. See analysis of Judge Rader's undisclosed conflicts of interest in Leader v. Facebook.




Judge Rader also did not stop his judges from creating new arguments and evidence for Facebook in the secrecy of chambers—after they had debunked all of Facebook's evidence on appeal, which is a clear breach of constitutional due process.

HOW TO FILE A FRAUD COMPLAINT AGAINST A UNIVERSITY

The following universities were announced as participants in Ohio State Provost Joseph A. Steinmetz's corrupt MOOC education initiative named "University Innovation Alliance" (UIA). We have identified the instructions and online forms you need to file a complaint with the participants. MOOC stands for "Massive Open Online Course." 
You should complain about:
(1) the intellectual property theft of social networking source code from Leader Technologies, Columbus, Ohio that is the software engine running the UIA; 
(2) the corruption at Ohio State University and OSU's collusion with Battelle Memorial Institute which helped steal the software being used by UIA; and 
(3) the mistreatement of OSU Marching Band Director Jon Waters regarding fabricated Title IX charges that were used to pave the way for Steinmetz to announce UIA. 
Universities pride themselves on protection of intellectual property. 
Therefore, these universities cannot participate in this abuse of inventor copyrights, patents and trade secrets by The Ohio State Trustees and Administration. If these universities participate knowingly with Ohio State in its theft of intellectual property, then they are aiding and abetting the theft of intellectual property on a "massive" scale... Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) also known as The Eclipse Foundation.
