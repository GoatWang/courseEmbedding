This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Oak Tree Acquisitions Also
The Form D signed by Jeremiah Lucey might help Oak Tree Acquisitions Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

    1.1 ABOUT THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY
Mutual fund is the pool of the money, based on the trust who invests the savings of a number of
investors who shares a common financial goal, like the capital appreciation and dividend
earning. The money thus collect is then invested in capital market instruments such as shares,
debenture, and foreign market. Investors invest money and get the units as per the unit value
which we called as NAV (net assets value).
A mutual fund provides individual investors with a convenient form of investing, professional
management, broad diversification and liquidity Mutual fund is the most suitable investment for
the common man as it offers an opportunity to invest in diversified portfolio management, good
research team, professionally managed Indian stock as well as the foreign market, the main aim
of the fund manager is to taking the scrip that have under value and future will rising, then fund
manager sell out the stock. Fund manager concentration on risk – return trade off, where
minimize the risk and maximize the return through diversification of the portfolio. Investments
in securities are spread across a wide cross-section of industries and sector sand thus the risk is
reduced. Diversification reduces the risk because all stocks may not move in thesame direction in
the same proportion at the same time. The most common features of the mutual fund unit are low
cost.
HISTORY OF MUTUAL FUNDS IN INDIA
The mutual fund industry in India started in 1963 with the formation of Unit Trust of India, at the
initiative of the Government of India and Reserve Bank of India. The history of mutual funds in
India can be broadly divided into four distinct phases.
 
  


        3.
      
    First Phase - 1964-1987
Unit Trust of India (UTI) was established in 1963 by an Act of Parliament. It was set up by the
Reserve Bank of India and functioned under the Regulatory and administrative control of the
Reserve Bank of India. In 1978 UTI was de-linked from the RBI and the Industrial Development
Bank of India (IDBI) took over the regulatory and administrative control in place of RBI. The
first scheme launched by UTI was Unit Scheme 1964. At the end of 1988 UTI had Rs. 6,700
crores of assets under management.
Second Phase - 1987-1993 (Entry of Public Sector Funds)
1987 marked the entry of non-UTI, public sector mutual funds set up by public sector banks and
Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC).
SBI Mutual Fund was the first non-UTI Mutual Fund established in June 1987 followed by
Canbank Mutual Fund (Dec 87), Punjab National Bank Mutual Fund (Aug 89), Indian Bank
Mutual Fund (Nov 89), Bank of India (Jun 90), Bank of Baroda Mutual Fund (Oct 92). LIC
established its mutual fund in June 1989 while GIC had set up its mutual fund in December
1990.
At the end of 1993, the mutual fund industry had assets under management of Rs. 47,004 crores.
Third Phase - 1993-2003 (Entry of Private Sector Funds)
With the entry of private sector funds in 1993, a new era started in the Indian mutual fund
industry, giving the Indian investors a wider choice of fund families. Also, 1993 was the year in
which the first Mutual Fund Regulations came into being, under which all mutual funds, except
UTI were to be registered and governed. The erstwhile Kothari Pioneer (now merged with
Franklin Templeton) was the first private sector mutual fund registered in July 1993.
The 1993 SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations were substituted by a more comprehensive and
revised Mutual Fund Regulations in 1996. The industry now functions under the SEBI (Mutual
Fund) Regulations 1996.
The number of mutual fund houses went on increasing, with many foreign mutual funds setting
up funds in India and also the industry has witnessed several mergers and acquisitions. As at the
 
  


        4.
      
    end of January 2003, there were 33 mutual funds with total assets of Rs. 1,21,805 crores. The
Unit Trust of India with Rs. 44,541 crores of assets under management was way ahead of other
mutual funds.
Fourth Phase - since February 2003
In February 2003, following the repeal of the Unit Trust of India Act 1963 UTI was bifurcated
into two separate entities. One is the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India with assets
under management of Rs. 29,835 crores as at the end of January 2003, representing broadly, the
assets of US 64 scheme, assured return and certain other schemes. The Specified Undertaking of
Unit Trust of India, functioning under an administrator and under the rules framed by
Government of India and does not come under the purview of the Mutual Fund Regulations.
The second is the UTI Mutual Fund, sponsored by SBI, PNB, BOB and LIC. It is registered with
SEBI and functions under the Mutual Fund Regulations. With the bifurcation of the erstwhile
UTI which had in March 2000 more than Rs. 76,000 crores of assets under management and with
the setting up of a UTI Mutual Fund, conforming to the SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, and
with recent mergers taking place among different private sector funds, the mutual fund industry
has entered its current phase of consolidation and growth.
The graph indicates the growth of assets over the years.

    ADVANTAGES OF MUTUAL FUNDS
1. Professional Investment Management.
By pooling the money of thousands of investors, mutual funds provide full-time, high-
level professional management that few individual investors can afford to obtain
independently. Such management can be important to achieving results in today's
complex markets.
2. Diversification.
Mutual funds invest in a broad range of securities. This limits investment risk by
reducing the effect of a possible decline in the value of any one security. Mutual fund
shareowners can benefit from diversification techniques usually available only to
investors wealthy enough to buy significant positions in a wide variety of securities.
3. Low Cost.
If you tried to create your own diversified portfolio of 50 stocks, you'd need at least
$100,000 and you'd pay thousands of dollars in commissions to assemble your portfolio.
A mutual fund lets you participate in a diversified portfolio for as little as $1,000, and
sometimes less.
4. Convenience and Flexibility.
You own just one security rather than many, yet enjoy the benefits of a diversified
portfolio and a wide range of services. Fund managers decide what securities to trade,
clip the bond coupons, collect the interest payments and see that your dividends on
portfolio securities are received and your rights exercised. It's easy to purchase and
redeem mutual fund shares, either directly online or with a phone call.
5. Quick, Personalized Service.
Most mutual funds now offer extensive websites with a host of shareholder services for
immediate access to information about your fund account. Or a phone call puts you in
touch with a trained investment specialist at a mutual fund company who can provide
information you can use to make your own investment choices, assist you with buying
and selling your mutual funds shares, and answer questions about your mutual fund
account status.
 
  


        6.
      
    6. Ease of Investing
You may open or add to your account and conduct transactions or business with the
mutual fund by mail, telephone or bank wire. You can even arrange for automatic
monthly investments by authorizing electronic fund transfers from your checking account
in any amount and on a date you choose.
7. Total Liquidity, Easy Withdrawal
You can easily redeem your shares anytime you need cash by letter, telephone, bank wire
or check, depending on the fund. Your proceeds are usually available within a
day or two.
8. Life Cycle Planning
With no-load mutual funds, you can link your investment plans to future individual and
family needs -- and make changes as your life cycles change. You can invest in growth
funds for future college tuition needs, then move to income mutual funds for retirement,
and adjust your investments as your needs change throughout your life.
With no-load mutual funds, there are no commissions to pay when you change your
investments.
9. Market Cycle Planning
For investors who understand how to actively manage their portfolio, mutual fund
investments can be moved as market conditions change. You can place your funds in
equities when the market is on the upswing and move into money market mutual funds
on the downswing or take any number of steps to ensure that your investments are
meeting your needs in changing market climates. A word of caution: since it is
impossible to predict what the market will do at any point in time, staying on course with
a long-term, diversified investment view is recommended for most investors.
10. Investor Information
Shareholders receive regular reports from the mutual funds, including details of
transactions on a year-to-date basis. The current net asset value of your shares (the price
at which you may purchase or redeem them) appears in the mutual fund price listings of
daily newspapers. You can also obtain pricing and performance results for the all mutual
funds at this site, or it can be obtained by phone from the mutual funds.
 
  


        7.
      
    DISADVANTAGES OF MUTUAL FUNDS
1. Dilution: Although diversification reduces the amount of risk involved in investing in
mutual funds, it can also be a disadvantage due to dilution. For example, if a single
security held by a mutual fund doubles in value, the mutual fund itself would not double
in value because that security is only one small part of the fund's holdings. By holding a
large number of different investments, mutual funds tend to do neither exceptionally well
nor exceptionally poorly.
2. Fees and Expenses: Most mutual funds charge management and operating fees that pay
for the fund's management expenses (usually around 1.0% to 1.5% per year for actively
managed funds). In addition, some mutual funds charge high sales commissions, 12b-1
fees, and redemption fees. And some funds buy and trade shares so often that the
transaction costs add up significantly. Some of these expenses are charged on an ongoing
basis, unlike stock investments, for which a commission is paid only when you buy and
sell.
3. Poor Performance: Returns on a mutual fund are by no means guaranteed. In fact, on
average, around 75% of all mutual funds fail to beat the major market indexes, like the
S&P 500, and a growing number of critics now question whether or not professional
money managers have better stock-picking capabilities than the average investor.
4. Loss of Control: The managers of mutual funds make all of the decisions about which
securities to buy and sell and when to do so. This can make it difficult for you when
trying to manage your portfolio. For example, the tax consequences of a decision by the
manager to buy or sell an asset at a certain time might not be optimal for you. You also
should remember that you are trusting someone else with your money when you invest in
a mutual fund.
5. Trading Limitations: Although mutual funds are highly liquid in general, most mutual
funds (called open-ended funds) cannot be bought or sold in the middle of the trading
day. You can only buy and sell them at the end of the day, after they've calculated the
current value of their holdings.
 
  


        8.
      
    6. Size: Some mutual funds are too big to find enough good investments. This is especially
true of funds that focus on small companies, given that there are strict rules about how
much of a single company a fund may own. If a mutual fund has $5 billion to invest and
is only able to invest an average of $50 million in each, then it needs to find at least 100
such companies to invest in; as a result, the fund might be forced to lower its standards
when selecting companies to invest in.
7. Inefficiency of Cash Reserves:Mutual funds usually maintain large cash reserves as
protection against a large number of simultaneous withdrawals. Although this provides
investors with liquidity, it means that some of the fund's money is invested in cash
instead of assets, which tends to lower the investor's potential return.
8. Too Many Choices: The advantages and disadvantages listed above apply to mutual
funds in general. However, there are over 10,000 mutual funds in operation, and these
funds vary greatly according to investment objective, size, strategy, and style. Mutual
funds are available for virtually every investment strategy (e.g. value, growth), every
sector (e.g. biotech, internet), and every country or region of the world. So even the
process of selecting a fund can be tedious.
TYPES OF MUTUAL FUND SCHEMES

Open Ended Schemes

2. BY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

        9.
      
    (A) BY STRUCTURE
1. OPEN ENDED SCHEMES
The units offered by these schemes are available for sale and repurchase on any
business day at NAV based prices. Hence, the unit capital of the schemes keeps
changing each day. Such schemes thus offer very high liquidity to investors and
are becoming increasingly popular in India. Please note that an open-ended fund is
NOT obliged to keep selling/issuing new units at all times, and may stop issuing further
subscription to new investors. On the other hand, an open-ended fund rarely denies
to its investor the facility to redeem existing units.
2. CLOSED ENDED SCHEMES
The unit capital of a close-ended product is fixed as it makes a one-time sale of
fixed number of units. These schemes are launched with an initial public offer
(IPO) with a stated maturity period after which the units are fully redeemed at
NAV linked prices. In the interim, investors can buy or sell units on the stock
exchanges where they are listed. Unlike open-ended schemes, the unit capital in closed-
ended schemes usually remains unchanged. After an initial closed period, the scheme
may offer direct repurchase facility to the investors. Closed-ended schemes
are usually more illiquid as compared to open-ended schemes and hence trade at a
discount to the NAV. This discount tends towards the NAV closer to the maturity date
of the scheme.
3. INTERVAL SCHEMES
These schemes combine the features of open-ended and closed-ended schemes. They may
be tradedon the stock exchange or may be open for sale or redemption during pre-
determined intervals at NAV based prices.
(B) BY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
 
  


        10.
      
     GROWTH SCHEMES
These schemes, also commonly called Equity Schemes, seek to invest a majority of
their funds inequities and a small portion in money market instruments. Such
schemes have the potential to deliver superior returns over the long term. However,
because they invest in equities, these schemes are exposed to fluctuations in value
especially in the short term.
These schemes are ideal for investors seeking growth over long term.
 INCOME SCHEMES
These schemes, also commonly called Debt Schemes, invest in debt securities such
as corporate bonds, debentures and government securities. The prices of these
schemes tend to be more stable compared with equity schemes and most of the
returns to the investors are generated through dividends or steady capital
appreciation. These schemes are ideal for conservative investors or those not in a position
to take higher equity risks, such as retired individuals. However, as compared to the
money market schemes they do have a higher price fluctuation risk and compared to a
Gilt fund they have a higher credit risk.
Ideal for : Retired people who need regular income and capital protection.
 BALANCES SCHEMES
Aim to provide both growth and income by periodically distributing a part of the income
and capital gains they earn. They invest in both shares and fixed income securities in the
proportion indicated in their offer documents. In a rising stock market, the NAV of these
schemes may not normally keep pace or fall equally when the market falls.
Ideal for: Investors looking for a combination of income and moderate growth.
 MONEYMARKEY/LIQUID SCHEMES
Aim to provide easy liquidity, preservation of capital and moderate income. These
schemes generally invest in safer, short term instruments such as treasury bills,
 
  


        11.
      
    certificates of deposit, commercial paper and interbank call money. Returns on these
schemes may fluctuate, depending upon the interest rates prevailing in the market.
Ideal for: Corporates and individual investors as a means to park their surplus funds for
short periods or awaiting a more favourable investment alternative.
(C) OTHER SCHEMES
 TAX SAVING SCHEMES OR EQUITY LINKED SAVING SCHEMES
These schemes offer tax incentives to the investors under tax laws as prescribed from
time to time and promote long term investments in equities through Mutual Funds.
Ideal for: Investors seeking tax incentives.
 SPECIAL SCHEMES
This category includes index schemes that attempt to replicate the performance of a
particular index such as the BSE Sensex, the NSE 50 (NIFTY) or sector specific schemes
which invest in specific sectors such as Technology, Infrastructure, Banking, Pharma etc.
Besides, there are also schemes which invest exclusively in certain segments of the
capital market, such as Large Caps, Mid Caps, Small Caps, Micro Caps, 'A' group shares,
shares issued through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), etc.
Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) are investment schemes floated by mutual funds and are
closeended with a fixed tenure, the maturity period ranging from one month to three/five
years. These plans are predominantly debt-oriented, while some of them may have a
small equity component. The objective of such a scheme is to generate steady returns
over a fixed-maturity period and protect the investor against market fluctuations. FMPs
are typically passively managed fixedincome schemes with the fund manager locking
into investments with maturities corresponding with the maturity of the plan. FMPs are
not guaranteed products.
 
  


        12.
      
    Exchange Traded Funds are essentially index funds that are listed and traded on
exchanges like Index fund schemes are ideal for investors who are satisfied with a return
approximately equal to that of an index.
Sectoral fund schemes are ideal for investors who have already decided to invest in a
particular sector or segment.

    About Edelweiss Group
Edelweiss Finance Limited was founded in the year 1996 and has been a lead player in the
financial industry ever since. The company provides asset management, insurance broking and
investment banking services to its customers. The company has its headquarters in Mumbai and
has operations in 19 Indian states. Edelweiss got approval to launch its own mutual fund business
in the year 2008.
Edelweiss Mutual Funds
Edelweiss mutual funds are an integral part of the Edelweiss Group. These mutual funds are a
professionally managed pool of funds that are invested on behalf of customers in various shares,
securities and debentures. The income earned from these is then shared with the investors in
proportion to the number of share units held by them.
Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd. manages mutual funds for Edelweiss. The company follows a
process-oriented and research-driven approach to help investors grow and manage their funds.
The fund management team at Edelweiss comes with a deep experience in the field of mutual
funds.
Types of Edelweiss Mutual Funds
Edelweiss mutual funds schemes fall under one of the below stated categories.
 Equity Funds: Equity funds are those mutual fund schemes that invest money of their investors
in equities or stocks. The risk associated with this type of fund is higher since the money is
directly invested into stocks and hence return as well as risk both are on the higher side as
compared to other fund types.
 Debt Funds: These type of mutual funds invest money in debt instruments like government
securities and corporate bonds. Debt funds are considered to be the safest fund options since the
risk associated with these is really low as compared to other fund types. The main motto of debt
funds is conservation of cash and generation of income.
 Liquid Funds: As the name indicates, liquid funds are aimed at greater liquidity which comes
mostly as a result of lower maturity period. These funds primarily invest in money market
instruments such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial papers and term deposits.
Liquid funds do not have a lock-in period and as such are the best fund option for short-term
investments.

    LITERATURE REVIEW
Gayathri, S., Karthika, S. & Kumar, Gajendran L. (2010)
reviewed on Mutual Funds in Indiaare financial instruments. A mutual fund is not
an alternative investment option to stocks and bonds; rather it pools the money of several
investors and invests this in stocks, bonds, moneymarket instruments and other types
of securities. The owner of a mutual fund unit gets a proportional share of the fund’s
gains, losses, income and expenses. Mutual Fund is vehicle for investment in stocks
and Bonds. Each mutual fund has a specific stated objective.
The fund’sobjective is laid out in the fund's prospectus, which is the legal doc
ument that containsinformation about the fund, its history, its officers and its performance.
Some popular objectives of a mutual fund are: Fund Objective - What the fund will invest in;
Equity (Growth) - Only in stocks; Debt (Income); Only in fixed-income securities; Money
Market (including Gilt) – In short-term money market instruments (including government
securities); Balanced - Partly in stocks and partly in fixed-income securities, in order to
maintain a 'balance' in returns and risk. The share value of the Mutual Funds in India is known as
net asset value per share (NAV). The NAV is calculated on the total amount of the Mutual
Funds in India, by dividing it with the number of shares issued and outstanding shares on
daily basis. The company that puts together a mutual fund is called an AMC. An AMC may have
several mutual fund schemes with similar or varied investment objectives. The AMC hires a
professional money manager, who buys and sells securities in line with the fund's stated
objective. The Securities and Exchange Board of India(SEBI) mutual fund regulations
require that the fund’s objectives are clearly spelt out in the prospectus. In addition, every
mutual fund has a board of directors that is supposed to represent the shareholders' interests,
rather than the AMC’s.

    has reviewed since long the performance of mutual funds has beenreceiving a great deal of
attention from both practitioners and academics. With an aggregateinvestment of trillion
dollars in India, the investing public’s interest in identifying successfulfund managers is
understandable. From an academic perspective, the goal of identifying superior fund managers
is interesting as it encourages development and application of new models andtheories.
The idea behind performance evaluation is to find the returns provided by the individualschemes
especially growth funds and the risk levels at which they are delivered in comparisonwith
the market and the risk free rates. It is also our aim to identify the out-performers
for healthy investments. We have also ranked the investment opportunities
for better evaluation of these funds based on various adjusted ratios
like Sharpe ratio, Jensen Measure, Fama ratio,Sortino ratio, Treynor’s ratio and few
others. Financial literature has very little studies whichconcentrate on multiple measures of
mutual fund performance evaluation. Therefore, an attempthas been made to capture the critical
measures of performance evaluation of mutual funds.
Agarwal, R K. and Mukhtar, W. (2010)
conducted a study; today mutual funds represent
themost appropriate opportunity for most small investors. As financial markets bec
ome moresophisticated and complex, investors need a financial intermediary who
provides the requiredknowledge and professional expertise on successful investing. It is
no wonder then that in the birth place of mutual funds- the USA - the fund industry has
already overtaken the bankingindustry, with more money under mutual fund management
than deposited with banks. This project covers a broad range of equity growth funds.
The objectives of the paper are as (a)Twenty four Equity growth funds have
been studied for the application of composite portfolio performance measures like Treynor
ratio, Sharpe ratio, Jenson ratio, Information ratio, M square,
Specific ratio etc, and (b) Evaluate the asset allocation policy for Kotak 30 Growth Mutual

Balanced and Income Funds outperform thestock market during Bear run
(C) Market outperforms Balanced and Income Funds over a longholding period
(a minimum period of three years). The objective of the study was to empiricallyinvestigate
whether the above stated perceptions are valid in the Indian context. For this purpose,six
hypotheses were tested. The performance of the 47 Balanced and 72 Income Funds
were analyzed in terms of Return,Risk, Return per Risk and Sharpe ratio over
the past three years (2006, 2007 and 2008) duringwhich period the Indian Stock
Market had witnessed much volatility. Further, the performance of these funds was compared
with that of the Market and Benchmark Indices. The Null Hypotheses were rejected leading to
the acceptance of Alternate Hypothesis in all thesix cases leading us to conclude that Market
outperformed both the Balanced and Income Fundsover Bull run and 3 - year periods
while both the funds outperformed the Market over Bear r un period which
confirms the popular belief of the Investors and Fund Managers in India.

Using daily data, we observe that for fund schemessorted on prior period
four- factor abnormal returns, the winner’s portfolio does provide
grossabnormal returns of 10% per annum on post-formation basis. The economic feasibility of
zero-investment trading strategies that involve buying past winners and selling past losers is
however in doubt. This is owing to the fact that these s trategies generate low
gross returns and that thewinner’s portfolios involve higher investment costs
than losers portfolios, thus destroying amajor portion of extra - normal
returns. O ur empirical findings are consistent with the efficient market
hypothesis and have implications for hedge funds and other managed portfolios that
relyon innovative investment styles, including the fund of funds

in this paper author’s conducted astudy on return based style analysis of equity mutual funds in
India using quadratic optimizationof an asset class factor model proposed by William Sharpe.
We found the 'style benchmarks' of each of our sample of equity funds as optimum
exposure to eleven passive asset class indexes
We also analyzed the relative performance of the funds with respect to their
style benchmarks.Our results show that the funds have not been able to beat their style
benchmarks on the average.

The study classified the 419 open-ended equity mutual fund schemes into six distinct investment
styles, analyzed the financial performance of select open-ended equity mutual fund schemes for
the period 1st April 2005 - 31st March 2006 pertaining to the two
dominantinvestment styles and tested the hypothesis whether the differences in perf
ormance arestatistically
significant. The variables chosen for analyzing financial performance are: monthly c
ompounded meanreturn, risk per unit return and Sharpe ratio. A comparison of the financial
performance of the 21Open-ended Equity growth plans and 21 Open-ended Equity
dividend plans was made in termsof the chosen variables. The analysis indicated that
Growth plans have generated higher returns than that of Dividend plans but at a higher
risk. Further, 17 Growth plans have generated higher returns than that of corresponding
Dividend plans offered by the same Asset

    conducted a research on Consumer be haviour from the marketingworld and
financial economics has brought together to the surface an exciting area for study andresearch:
behavioural finance. The realization that this is a serious subject is,
however, barelydawning. Analysts seem to treat financial markets as an
aggregate of statistical

financial markets are also affected by the 'financial behaviour' of investors.With the reforms of
industrial policy, public sector, financial sector and the many developmentsin the Indian
money market and capital market, Mutual Funds which has become an
important portal for the small investors, is also influenced by their
financial behaviour. Hence, this studyhas made an attempt to examine the related
aspects of the fund selection behaviour of individualinvestors towards Mutual funds, in the city
of Mumbai. From the researchers and academicians point of view, such a study will help in
developing and expanding knowledge in this field.

conducted a research In Recent years have seen a dramatic shift frommutual
funds into hedge funds even though hedge funds charge management fees that have
beendecried as outrageous. While expectations of superior returns
may be responsible for this shift,this article shows that mutual funds are more expensive
than commonly believed. Mutual fundsappear to provide investment services for
relatively low fees because they bundle passive and active funds management
together in a way that understates the true cost of active management.I n particular, funds
engaging in closet or shadow indexing charge their investors for
activemanagement while providing them with little more than an indexed investment. Even the
averagemutua l fund, which ostensibly provides only active management, will
have over 90% of theva r ia n c e in it s r e t ur ns e xp la i ne d b y it s

Computing this active expense ratio requiresonly a fund's published expense ratio, it’s
R- squared relative to a benchmark index, and theexpense ratio for a
competitive fund that tracks that index. At the e nd of 2004, the mean
activeexpense ratio for the large - cap equity mutual funds tracked by
Morningstar was 7%, over sixtimes their published expense ratio of 1.15%.
 
  


        31.
      
    More broadly, funds in the Morningstar universe had a mean active expense ratio of
5.2%, while the largest funds averaged a percent or two less.

closing N AVs. The source of data is
website of Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). Study period is September 98-April
02(bear period). We started with a sample of 269 open ended schemes (out of total schemes of
433)for computing relative performance index. Then after excluding the funds whose returns are
lessthan risk- free returns, 58 schemes were used for furthe r analysis. Mean
monthly (logarithmic)retur n and risk of the sample mutual fund schemes
during the period were 0.59% and 7.10%, respectively, compared to similar statistics of
0.14% and 8.57% for market portfolio. The resultsof performance measures suggest that most of
the mutual fund schemes in the sample of 58 wereable to satisfy investor's expectations
by giving excess returns over expected returns based on both premium for
systematic risk and total risk.

3.3 RESEARCHMETHODOLOGYOF THE STUDY
The core concept underlying research is its methodology. The methodology controls the study,
dictates the acquisition of the data, and arranges them in logical relationships, sets up a means of
refining the raw data, contrives an approach so that the meanings that lie below the surface of
those data become manifest, and finally issue a conclusion or series of conclusions that lead to an
expansion of knowledge. The entire process is a unified effort as well as an appreciation of its
component parts.
3.3.1 ResearchDesign

3.3.3 Sample Design
Data analysis
The Net Asset Value Returns of various schemes of EDELWEISS Mutual Funds are analyzed . For
measuring the risk various statistical tools like beta, standard deviation etc. are used. To know the mutual
fund having the highest return at each unit of risk, Sharpe ratio is used.
3.3.3.1 Population
Mutual Funds schemes of Edelweiss. A research population is generally a large collection of
individuals or objects that is the main focus of a scientific query. It is for the benefit of the
population that researches are done. However, due to the large sizes of populations, researchers
often cannot test every individual in the population because it is too expensive and time-
consuming. This is the reason why researchers rely on sampling techniques.
3.3.3.2 Sample Size
 
  


        37.
      
    A sample is simply a subset of the population. The concept of sample arises from the inability of
the researchers to test all the individuals in a given population. The sample must be
representative of the population from which it was drawn and it must have good size to warrant
statistical analysis.
The sample size taken here is 4 Mutual Fund Schemes of EDELWEISS.

Shoalmire Adds Assets to RMI Program
Project coordinator expands scope, opportunities March 18, 2016  by Edwin Smith Kathryn Shoalmire
As project coordinator for the risk management and insurance program at the University of Mississippi, Kathy Shoalmire (JD 88) brought 27 years of institutional experience into the position. After a year on the job, she shared some of the highlights of the last several months and her observations about the program.
“I have been impressed first and foremost by the leadership of the program both historical and present day,” said Shoalmire, who formerly worked as the childbirth educator and international board-certified lactation consultant at Baptist Memorial Hospital-North Mississippi. “Larry Cox (former RMI chair) and Camille Mitchell (former RMI project coordinator) did an excellent job laying the foundation for this program. Andre (Liebenberg, RMI chair) has built on that success and has taken the program to new heights.”
Shoalmire said she is amazed not only by the impressive credentials of the insurance advisory board members but also by their commitment to the program.
“The first meeting that I attended, we had board members from all over the state, Tennessee and California who came to a Wednesday afternoon meeting (lunch not included) that lasted for roughly two hours,” she said. “This showed me right off that there was something special about this program. I have continued to be impressed at the subsequent meetings by the attendance, leadership and desire to expand the RMI program. Their commitment is to the students, Ole Miss and the insurance industry.”
Shoalmire’s experience as a staff assistant in Washington, D.C., for Sens. John Stennis and Thad Cochran helped prepare her for her current responsibilities.
“I had worked in government, law and medicine and thought before I retired that I would like to try the academic realm,” she said. “I wanted something part time that allowed me flexibility to be self-directed and project focused. The job description seemed to fit, and after meeting with Andre and the interviewing team, I was sold on this job. I might add, I have not been disappointed. I don’t think that I have ever worked in a more professional environment.”
As project coordinator, Shoalmire handles the printing and mailing of RMI’s annual resume book, two RMI career fairs, the insurance symposium, golf tournament, plus four advisory board meetings. Regarding the career fairs, she said the highlight is the industry representatives’ enthusiasm about meeting the Ole Miss RMI students.
“The first career fair I organized was fall 2014,” she said. “I was nervous about how things would go, but during the second career fair in February 2015, I was relaxed and found myself feeling like a proud parent. I was able to go from focusing on my performance to watching as our students took a major leap in seeking to establish themselves in their chosen profession.”
From December through March, Shoalmire said she basically lived and breathed the insurance symposium.
“There is a great deal of effort that goes on behind the scenes,” she said. “Andre and the symposium committee from our advisory board secure the speakers. This year, we had an impressive lineup, which resulted in a record attendance. To see all the individual components come together to form a successful event is beautiful. I truly loved it.”
Her first academic year ended with the golf tournament, which gave her a fresh perspective on the game.
“I have a 20-year-old son who grew up playing competitive golf, so I’ve spent hundreds of hours on the golf course with him,” said Shoalmire, who played for a few years before he was born. “I see why some people refer to golf as a disease instead of a game. The golf tournament committee and Annandale (Golf Club) made this essentially an easy task. We had an excellent turnout, and my son got to play. I was very proud when I learned he won longest drive, estimated to be 340 yards.”
Trying to update and maintain the RMI mailing list has been a challenging task for Shoalmire. 
“My first email was sent to about 1,600 people. Within an hour, I received a call from Sam, our IT person,” she said. “There were so many returned emails that I clogged the system. He gently explained that sending this many emails looks like phishing. I learned and have now culled the list to about 900.”
So far this year, Shoalmire has been busy helping to re-establish the chapter of Gamma Iota Sigma, an international business fraternity for students of insurance, risk management and actuarial science. 
“Andre and Steve (Fier, assistant professor of finance) have asked me to take a more active role in working with the students,” she said. “I tend to be very people oriented, so that has been enjoyable. I have joined them for meetings and took a group of officers to the GIS conference in Chicago.” 
The chapter officers are enthusiastic and dedicated to getting the chapter moving in the right direction. 
“It is a great privilege to be a part of this process, and I appreciate the confidence that Andre and Steve have placed in me,” Shoalmire said. “As this year comes to a close, I am looking forward to deepening my relationship with our advisory board, sponsors, alumni, students and the industry representatives.”
A Starkville native, Shoalmire earned her bachelor’s degree in secondary education with an emphasis in history and political science from Mississippi State University. Following a career in Washington, she graduated from the Ole Miss law school in 1988. Prior to working at Baptist, she worked for several years with Arnold, Bass and Associates, a science consulting firm that specialized in accident reconstruction. She recently passed a rigorous exam to renew her certification as an international board-certified lactation consultant. Shoalmire continues to do private consulting in her spare time. 
 
Filed Under: RMI Newsletter Two Young Alumnae Shine in Corporate World
Alivia Cooper and Anna Bendgen both 2014 graduates March 18, 2016  by Elizabeth Burgreen Alivia Cooper
Alivia Cooper (BBA 14) and Anna Bendgen (BBA 14) are quickly making an impression at their jobs.
 Cooper, a marketing underwriter for Amerisure Insurance Co. in Tampa, Florida, started her undergraduate career as a chemistry major in hopes of pursuing a career in medical research. Unsure of what she wanted to do, she decided to change her major and joined UM’s School of Business Administration in spring 2012. Cooper chose to triple major in risk management and insurance, managerial finance, and banking and finance.
Along with succeeding in the classroom, Cooper was also a member of the Ole Miss rifle team for four years and participated in the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials for a chance to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
With three majors worth of knowledge, Cooper, a Louisville, Kentucky, native, realized during job training that she was immediately applying loads of information from her undergraduate degrees to her job at Amerisure. This helped her become the youngest individual to receive the University Associate Certified Risk Manager (UACRM) designation in January 2015 and then go on to achieve the Certified Risk Managers designation. Fast forward to November 2015, and Cooper was assigned as lead underwriter of Amerisure’s second-largest agency.
“Becoming an underwriter after completing my risk management and insurance degree has proved to provide me with an extremely solid foundation,” Cooper said. “Continually enhancing the coverage form knowledge that it takes to be an underwriter will prove beneficial in virtually all aspects of the insurance industry.”
Cooper’s first project as an underwriter was to implement a property coverage form into a new policy management system. Along with underwriters selected from across the country, she was selected to specialize in the coverage, test the system for errors and become a resource for other underwriters in her office who had questions about this particular form.
Most recently, Cooper was selected as one of three underwriters in the company to learn how to model wind risks throughout the country. Prior to her selection, all wind modeling had to be sent to a corporate consultant to have this task performed. Cooper is now able to perform this task for other underwriters in her office, mainly focusing on accurately pricing hurricane risks in coastal regions
Anna Bendgen
Bendgen, a business continuity and risk administrator for Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. in Memphis, Tennessee, knew when she started college that she wanted to enter the workforce immediately after graduation. During her junior year, she interned with Sedgwick in the risk management department and enjoyed the opportunity to learn about the risk management and insurance world. In fall of her senior year, a position opened with Sedgwick, and Bendgen was quick to apply.
Bendgen, a Munroe Falls, Ohio, native, said she uses knowledge she learned from the classroom every day at her job and that the communication courses and soft skills have helped her succeed quickly. Since starting her job in May 2014, she received the Risk and Insurance Management Society Rising Star of the Year award, an accolade given to risk professionals who have demonstrated exceptional initiative, volunteerism, professional development, achievement and leadership potential. Along with winning the national honor, Bendgen accepted the inaugural award at the society’s annual conference.
Currently, she is leading the effort to develop a workplace violence prevention and response training program and also is charged with maintaining and testing Sedgwick’s business continuity plans.
With the help of RMI professors Stephen Fier and Andre Liebenberg, both Cooper and Bendgen were able to seek out scholarships and internships to help find which area of insurance was right for them. “The passion they have for the subject matter they teach is infectious, and the amount of time and energy they invest in helping their students succeed is inspiring,” Bendgen said.

Workshops help participants move from ideas to viable business plans February 6, 2016  by Elizabeth Burgreen  Volunteer coaches and professionals help advise emerging entrepreneurs throughout the course of the weekend.
OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi’s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Insight Park and School of Business Administration are co-hosting Startup Weekend Oxford, set for Feb. 12-14.
The weekend will feature Innovation Boot Camp, Discovery Luncheon and Startup Weekend activities. The beginning of the weekend will give participants experience with assembling business models, with the end of the weekend resulting in pitching these business models to potential investors.
Innovation Boot Camp is a two-hour workshop beginning at 3 p.m. in Holman Hall, Room 38, designed to help students develop viable business and product ideas. Students are able to have one-on-one communication with faculty and brainstorming sessions with other participating students. The boot camp is the Startup Weekend kickoff event for students.
The Discovery Luncheon begins at 11:30 a.m. Feb. 12 at the Oxford Conference Center and features guest speaker Garret Gray, president and CEO of Next Gear Solutions of Oxford.
Later that evening, the Startup Weekend activities commence. Over the course of 54 hours, participants have an opportunity to create a viable business. Powered by Google for Entrepreneurs, this three-day event brings together entrepreneurs, programmers, coders, developers and other business-minded individuals to form ideas and create business plans.
“Startup Weekend is an opportunity for startup enthusiasts to collaborate and go from concept to creation over a weekend,” said William Nicholas, UM director of economic development and organizer of the event. “It is a real pleasure to be surrounded talented people with a passion for entrepreneurship.”
Participants begin by taking 60 seconds to pitch their ideas to the group of attendees. All attendees vote for their favorite ideas, and the winning ideas are selected to build upon for the weekend. The group then divides into smaller teams, and each team spends the remainder of the weekend focusing in on a single business idea to develop.
Clay Dibrell, associate professor of management and holder of the William W. Gresham Jr. Entrepreneurial Professorship, is also the CIE’s executive director. He said he is excited to see members of the campus, community and state entrepreneurial-focused organizations work together to make this event possible.
“It is thrilling to see people who come to Startup Weekend with just an idea, and then over the weekend, you can see these potential entrepreneurs turning the corner from an idea to starting a new venture,” he said.
Stephen D. Johnston, CEO and board member of SmartSynch Inc. in Jackson, is the guest speaker on Friday night. His expertise at leading his company from start-up to a global technology leader for cellular-based smart grid communications will inspire participants in their quest to succeed as entrepreneurs.
During the course of the weekend, volunteer coaches will assist the teams and provide advice. A panel of professionals evaluates each group’s business development and their chances of real-world success.
“It is a highly beneficial partnership between Ole Miss entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship entities outside of the university,” Dibrell said. “Our common goal is to build an entrepreneurial ecosystem which allows Mississippi entrepreneurs to successfully stay in Mississippi.”
Insight Park staff members, the Oxford-Lafayette County Economic Development Foundation and employees of Innovate Mississippi organize Startup Weekend Oxford.

Filed Under: News Releases, School of Business Administration UM Ranked Among Nation’s Best MBA Programs
Campus and online programs rise in prestigious Businessweek and U.S. News listings November 21, 2015  by Edwin Smith Holman Hall
OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi School of Business Administration has risen significantly on Bloomberg Businessweek’s 2015 list of Best MBA programs.
UM ranked No. 69 this year in the second year that Bloomberg Businessweek has compiled the list. This is up seven places from its No. 76 position a year ago. Bloomberg compiled data from more than 13,150 students, 28,540 alumni and 1,460 recruiters. The university ranked highest in the student survey and job placement areas of the five-part survey.
“We are excited about the ranking, and it indicates the wonderful work of our faculty and staff in recruiting exceptional students and creating meaningful educational opportunities,” said Ken Cyree, dean of the UM business school. “The ranking will help our academic reputation, but is more of a reflection of what is already happening in the school and MBA program.”
The Ole Miss MBA program is an exceptional value for students, said Ann Canty, associate professor of management and faculty director of the MBA program.
“Students get an outstanding educational experience from an internationally accredited and highly respected business school at an affordable cost,” Canty said. “Most MBA programs are much more expensive.”
Cyree attributed much of the business school’s success to hiring talented faculty who understand its mission of providing high-quality teaching and research, as well as the engagement of its MBA board who have diligently worked to create an environment of learning the soft skills – such as speaking, writing and job-seeking – to help bolster solid academic preparation.
“Of course we could not do this without the intentional effort to recruit the best students, and our staff has been instrumental in raising the bar for admissions, which helps enhance our success,” he said. “Most importantly, it is rewarding that our graduates will benefit from the MBA degree and this ranking helps indicate the value that is obtained through earning an Ole Miss MBA.”
UM also recently was ranked among the Top 14 online MBA programs by U.S. News. The 36-hour online program, designed for working professionals, is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.
The program may be completed in two years by taking two courses in fall, spring and summer. There is no residency requirement and students are not charged nonresident fees. More than 70 percent of the online students complete the MBA program in two years.
“Support from the MBA Alumni Board makes our program unique,” said Del Hawley, associate professor of finance and senior associate dean of the business school. “The board is made up of alumni who work at successful businesses, such as FedEx, Auto Zone and KPMG. Members come to campus several times a year and work one-on-one with our students.”
Alumni also lead professional development workshops for students with the goal of making Ole Miss MBAs stand out.
“They want Ole Miss graduates to have a polished resume in their hand, to walk with confidence into an interview and to be a valued employee in their company,” said Ashley Jones, director of MBA administration. “Recent exit interviews with students indicate the MBA students are successful in their job search. According to interviews conducted with May and August graduates, 67 percent had jobs prior to degree completion. The average compensation was $63,000.”

Part of Glass’ gift also will benefit the business school. Photo by Thomas Graning/Ole Miss Communications
OXFORD, Miss. – When businessman John D. Glass talks about his father – a hard-working business owner of a printing company and publisher of a newspaper – the love and respect can be heard each time he recalls a memory.
A longtime benefactor of the University of Mississippi, Glass has established two new endowments, including a named faculty chair to pay tribute to his father’s life. The William Quintard Glass Chair of Journalism in the Meek School of Journalism and New Media is a nod to his father’s long career at the helm of Glass Printing Co. and The Newbern Tennessean newspaper in Dyer County.
John Glass of Memphis, Tennessee, has committed a planned gift of $2 million to establish the faculty chair and to create the John D. Glass Endowment for Business Excellence in support of the university’s School of Business Administration. Previously, Glass funded a faculty support endowment in his name and a speaker series in his father’s name, both for the business school.
“I have always loved my father and the University of Mississippi,” Glass said. “I could not think of a better way to remember both. Think about it – his name will be linked forever to Ole Miss. I am proud to make this gift. I remember when Pop and I were hugging each other for the last time, he whispered into my ear, ‘Son, I love you, and have you said your prayers?’ These are the words I hold dear.
“My Pop only had a fifth-grade education. His father died when he was young, leading him to quit school and work to help support his family. Even with this background, he was a great believer in college and always encouraged me to give my best efforts. As a result, I have earned undergraduate, master’s and law degrees, all because of him.”
While $500,000 of his new planned gift is directed to the business school, where Glass earned his undergraduate degree, the remaining $1.5 million secures a named chair-level faculty position in the journalism school. Building faculty support continues as a top priority for UM, which boasts the largest student enrollment among Mississippi’s public universities and needs to add around 215 faculty members over the next three years, Ole Miss leaders have said.
Named faculty positions offer prestige and salary supplements needed to recruit top faculty members.
Will Norton, dean of the journalism school – an academic unit experiencing rapid growth with undergraduate enrollment soaring 26.6 percent, from 1,044 students in fall 2014 to 1,322 this year – expressed appreciation for Glass’ decision to fund and name a faculty chair for his father.
“It means a great deal to the Meek School and the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics when an accomplished professional makes a significant donation to pay tribute to a longtime journalist,” Norton said.
“John Glass is not only honoring his father, but he is also helping assure that future students benefit from outstanding professional instruction. We are deeply grateful for this tremendous gift and feel that Mr. Glass’ father would be proud to have his name permanently linked with the preparation of future journalists.”
Glass hopes the holder of the William Quintard Glass Chair of Journalism can mentor UM students, as his father mentored him. After an almost-50-year career in the trust area of banking with Union Planters, First Tennessee and Morgan Keegan, Glass and a business partner formed Sentry LLC, a private wealth management firm in Memphis.
“Because of Pop’s guidance, I chose to pursue a banking career from 1960 to 2009 in the trust department,” he explained. “He told me this area was the best way to learn how to make and manage money; that turned out to be very good advice.”
Ken Cyree, dean of UM’s School of Business Administration, saluted Glass for sharing his resources.
“John Glass continues to enjoy an incredible career and stands as an excellent role model in ‘giving back,'” Cyree said. “He doesn’t take his successes lightly, maintaining a strong belief in ‘paying it forward’ to express his dedication to a father, who passed on valuable life lessons, and to his alma mater, which prepared him for his career.
“The impact of Mr. Glass’ investments in the business school will be far-reaching, helping to assure students are taught to be business leaders and visionaries.”
Glass grew up in Newbern, Tennessee, and joined the Ole Miss student body, where he says he learned, in addition to academic study, “to get along with people and how to conduct myself in public.”
“When I arrived on campus, I felt as though I was ‘home.’ If you love home, you always come back,” said Glass, who also has a home in Oxford and attends athletics and other events. “I’m thankful for everything – every opportunity – that I was given. I want to bless Ole Miss for what it’s done for me.”
When giving credit to Ole Miss and his father, Glass also makes a point of thanking God.
“My Heavenly Father has blessed me more than I could ever imagine. He has been more than abundantly good to me. Everything I have comes from Him for reasons known only to Him. I want to give back to Him what He has graciously given me. It is much better to serve than to be served.”
Glass hopes his gifts provide educational opportunities that students embrace. When asked what he would tell today’s college students, he said, “Make good grades and persevere – never think about quitting. College is a real opportunity; try diligently and stay with it.”
Glass said his father encouraged him to do the same by using a unique illustration: “When I graduated from Ole Miss, Pop took me into the kitchen and turned on the water. He said, ‘This is you in college.’ Next he turned off the water. ‘This is you out of college; get a job and get off my payroll.’ As you can see, both the University of Mississippi and my Pop have blessed me over and over again. I am giving back to them because they graciously gave to me.”
Glass’ planned gift gives him membership in the 1848 Society, named for the year the university opened its doors. The society recognizes generous donors who thoughtfully provide for the university through planned and deferred gifts.

Thursday’s activities begin with breakfast at The Inn at Ole Miss, followed by a welcome session featuring Mike Chaney, Mississippi commissioner of insurance.

New mark is highest national ranking ever for program November 19, 2014  by Christina Steube The UM School of Business Administration is housed in Holman Hall.
OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi’s MBA program has been ranked 76th nationally by Bloomberg Businessweek.
The schools that made the ranking are considered by Businessweek to offer the strongest education and best preparation for business careers.
“We are very happy with the MBA ranking,” said Ken Cyree, dean of the School of Business Administration. “This ranking reflects the hard work of our faculty and staff, as well as the board who has helped us in many ways. We are grateful for the recognition and will continue the good work to provide an excellent education and preparation to our students entering the workforce, and enhance the value of the MBA degrees for our alumni.”
The MBA program has been ranked in the low 90s by U.S. News and World Report, but this is the highest national ranking it has ever received, said Del Hawley, the school’s senior associate dean. The program was ranked higher than other respected programs, including those at the University of Alabama, Oklahoma University and Baylor University, he said.
“The Businessweek ranking is exciting news!” Hawley said. “Clearly, our program delivers tremendous value to our students and is an increasingly attractive alternative to many larger and more costly programs.”
The rankings are based on student satisfaction, which includes school culture and academic quality; a survey from employers that hire those graduates to reflect career prep of the program; and the expertise of the faculty that administers the education, including articles published in business journals.
“This upward ranking trend reinforces what so many global employers, alumni and current students know: graduating with an Ole Miss MBA provides students with an educational cornerstone to succeed throughout their career,” said Chris Daniel, MBA Alumni Board president and a strategic buyer for Exxon Mobil in Houston.
Ann Canty, the MBA program faculty director, said she is thankful for student participation in the survey.
“We are aware that MBA students consistently tell us that school culture is important in selecting the right MBA program,” Canty said. “The unique aspects of the Ole Miss MBA program school culture were communicated very well by our students.”
The program’s goal is to increase enrollment with strong candidates and equip MBA students with the tools to succeed in a competitive workforce, said Ashley Jones, director of MBA/MHA administration.
“Support from our MBA Alumni Board makes our program unique,” Jones said. “The board realizes the importance of professional development and has created a series of professional development workshops to make Ole Miss MBAs stand out. Their time and dedication to prepare our students is an asset to our program.”
According to the findings, the Ole Miss business school has an average GMAT score of 550 for admitted students. The cost of the program for Mississippi residents is around $15,000 and the average salary of graduates from the program is $56,000 annually.

OXFORD, Miss. – The University of Mississippi’s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship has awarded seed money to students through the newly created Rebel Venture Capital Fund, which helps with business startup costs.
Clay Dibrell, an associate professor of management and executive director of the center who also holds the William W. Gresham Jr. Entrepreneurial Lectureship, said the fund began to gain traction last spring after UM business Dean Ken Cyree suggested it. Bill Fry chaired the fund, which has raised about $35,000 in donations from UM alumni, which will be used to help students with their business ideas.
“We think about it in terms of factors of production – land, labor, capital,” Dibrell said. “So the entrepreneurs are providing the ideas and the knowledge, and the drive to get something going. Our donors wanted to give them an opportunity to try, and possibly fail, with their ideas in a nurturing environment.”

Dibrell credits Fry with his work as chairman to get the fund started, which resulted in grants totaling $7,000 awarded to two student projects in October.
Dwight Barnes, a senior business management major from Jackson, and Jasmine Brown, a senior accounting major from Jackson, were given one of the grants to help get their clothing line started. “Chasing Ten Figures” clothing is a joint effort between Barnes and Brown, as well as Barnes’ cousin, Theodis Barnes, who lives in New Mexico. The clothing company idea was awarded $4,000.
“For us to be in the venture challenge and win, it just shows the hard work and dedication we put in is being rewarded,” Barnes said. “It just made me hungry to succeed and continue to do more and stay on the course. We’re going in the right direction. I’m very grateful for the opportunity.”
The company started in February, and the partners use digital printers for their T-shirts, and are also making baseball caps, bucket hats and hockey jerseys, among other items, Barnes said.
A proposal to launch a web platform and a mobile application that links  reliable students who want to sell their services to people and businesses willing to hire them got the other grant, for $3,000. The developers of the website and mobile app, called Geeks n Gigs, hope to give students a place to get both professional and nonprofessional jobs, which can help them earn extra money or find jobs that beef up their resumes.
The venture also helps people and businesses find and hire students to perform their temporary tasks.
The website is expected to launch in January 2015. Two third-year law students, Alicia Netterville, of Greenville, and Cydney Archie, of Brandon, created the site and are preparing it for launch.
“The Rebel Venture Capital Fund has allowed us to significantly increase our marketing campaign and complete the method by which payments will be received and distributed via our system,” Archie said. “Outside financial support, the Rebel Venture Fund has provided a wealth of information and support that has made some of our growing pains easier. The fund also provided us with mentors who have offered candid and valuable advice.”
The CIE’s mission is “to inspire our students to create valuable new businesses and enhance the economic value of all businesses in the state of Mississippi through excellent teaching, exceptional service and world-class research.” Through the Rebel Venture Capital Fund, the CIE is to award grants to student projects each semester.
The next grants are slated be awarded this spring, and students are invited to present business proposals.
Applications should not be submitted until student entrepreneurs have discussed their ideas with friends and, preferably, already generated some sales or revenue, CIE officials advised. Proposals are not likely to be considered for funding if they have not generated revenues. Students seeking more information can email questions about the fund to CIE@bus.olemiss.edu.

Two grants provide collaborative opportunity for UM business, community engagement programs August 14, 2014  by Sharon Morris School of Business Administration Dean, Ken Cyree
OXFORD, Miss. – A grant from the Robert M. Hearin Support Foundation is expanding the capacity of the University of Mississippi’s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The $370,500 grant will provide support for the center’s student-led consulting program for three years.
Through the Student Entrepreneurship and New Venture Development Program, the center will create a student-led consulting program that focuses on helping startup and early-stage Mississippi businesses achieve growth, profitability and success.
“This grant is extremely important to get the center off the ground and to help us provide the knowledge and skills so our students can start businesses and engage in the economy,” said Ken Cyree, dean of the School of Business Administration. “I believe this is a watershed moment for the Mississippi and regional economy and I am hopeful that the center will provide the catalyst for many startup firms that are successful, in addition to better innovation in existing businesses. We look forward to the focus the center will bring to entrepreneurship and to funding Rebel-led businesses for many years. ”
The program, which will launch during the fall 2014 semester, will provide employment for up to 10 UM business students. Working under faculty supervision, the students will assist entrepreneurs throughout Mississippi, including those in UM’s Office of Technology Transfer, Small Business Development Center and to businesses located within UM’s Insight Park business incubator. The students will also participate in the projects and initiatives developed by the center.
“A primary goal of the business school is to provide our students with opportunities to gain real-world work experience,” said Clay Dibrell, UM professor of business management and the center’s executive director. “The Hearin Foundation grant provides us with an avenue for students to be able to work on actual entrepreneurship projects, which will help their entrepreneurial clients be more successful. This experience will allow the students to use the skills they learn in the classroom and to apply these skills, which we anticipate will enable them to be more competitive in the job market or enhance their probabilities of success if they choose to start their own business.”
Student teams will provide a broad range of services aimed at helping startups develop and implement stable business plans. Services will include social media marketing, payment system development, accounting system implementation, marketing design, customer outreach, promotions, process reengineering, bank document preparation and more. Students may also connect clients to other university resources as needed.
A separate, $1.6 million grant from the Robert M. Hearin Support Foundation for the university’s McLean Institute for Public Service and Community Engagement will support the Catalyzing Entrepreneurship and Economic Development Initiative, which seeks to increase entrepreneurship and promote economic development in rural Mississippi communities. The McLean Institute and the business school plan to collaborate on projects that will help improve economic development through both traditional and social entrepreneurship programs.
“The entrepreneurship faculty envision the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to be a catalyst in continuing to develop and enhance the Ole Miss entrepreneurial ecosystem to benefit our stakeholders,” Dibrell said. “This grant enables us to further develop our collaborative relationships with other departments on campus, as well as increasing the likelihood for entrepreneurial ventures coming out of Ole Miss to be successful, which is good not only for the university but also for the state of Mississippi.”
