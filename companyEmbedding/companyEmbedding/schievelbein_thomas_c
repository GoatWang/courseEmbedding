RICHMOND, Va., June 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The Brink's Company (NYSE:   BCO), a global leader in security-related services, today announced that its board of directors has elected Thomas C.

"We are pleased to announce that, after an extensive search, we have chosen Tom to lead Brink's on a permanent basis," said Murray D. Martin, who will continue as the board's lead independent director.  "Under his leadership as interim CEO, Brink's launched a thorough review of its entire business portfolio while accelerating productivity efforts, and a plan to reduce 2012 operating costs in North America is well under way.  As a member of the Brink's board since 2009, Tom understands our business and our markets, yet brings a fresh set of eyes to our future.  His combination of vision, operating experience and leadership skills makes us highly confident in his ability to create significant value for our shareholders, customers and employees." 
Schievelbein said:  "I'm honored and excited to have this opportunity to lead Brink's at such an important time in its history.  My experience as interim CEO has reinforced what I believed when I joined the board three years ago -- Brink's is the best operator in the industry, with an iconic brand and an unmatched global infrastructure.  We must leverage these strengths to maximize profits in mature markets, pursue growth in Latin America and other emerging markets, and grow high-value services.  Our job is to accelerate the execution of this strategy.  To that end, we're reviewing our entire business portfolio to ensure alignment with our strategy and financial goals.  We are taking a fresh look at capital allocation and necessary returns, and we're pursuing new opportunities to enhance productivity and reduce costs.  Our objective is to build meaningful value for our shareholders, and we will continue to take the steps necessary to do so."
