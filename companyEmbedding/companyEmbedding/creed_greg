Life Lessons








“Take the jobs no one else wants.”
                      Tweet this









“Creating great experiences for employees is the key to delivering superb experiences for customers.”
                      Tweet this









“Don’t use as much detergent as they tell you to use.”
                      Tweet this







 













Age 2, with his parents, in Australia, 1959








“According to my mum, my preschool teacher said, ‘He may not be the brightest kid in the class, but if he finds his passion, he’s going to be very successful.’ So I said to Mum, ‘Was that a compliment?’ ”








“In a big company like Unilever, there are the growing brands and the ones everyone thinks are ready for the trash heap. If you can turn those around, you make a name for yourself.”









PepsiCo spun off KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell into Tricon Global Restaurants in 1997; Tricon was renamed Yum! Brands in 2002
                        














“We came up with ‘Think Outside the Bun,’ repositioned our products, relaunched the brand, and went from seven years of decline to four and a half years of growth.”








“A lot of people were surprised, including me. I was like, ‘I don’t really know how to run restaurants. I know how to build brands.’ ”







 























“I almost became an army officer—I did the Army Cadets, which is similar to ROTC. I decided not to, because I couldn’t study business and serve in the reserves.”



College graduation











With one of Taco Bell’s first franchisees, Dan Jones (left), at the brand’s 50th anniversary celebration, 2012








“We had an E. coli issue and then got sued for supposedly not having any beef in our meat. We ran an ad that said, ‘Thank you for suing us. Now we can tell our story.’ And when they withdrew the lawsuit, we ran, ‘Would it kill you to say you’re sorry?’ ”








“We have over 43,000 restaurants in 135 countries, and we open six new ones per day on average. We completed the separation of our China business on Oct. 31, creating two powerful, independent companies.”











With his wife, Carolyn, 2014

Yum Brands CEO: Robots Will Take Over Fast Food Jobs In Next 10 Years
By Laura Northrup March 29, 2017 Working in the fast-food industry can be hard work for little pay, and now employees have to worry about their job security as well. Fast food remains popular, but one prominent CEO predicts that within the next decade, more work in fast food restaurants will be taken over by robots.  [More]

Taco Bell To Break From Its Authentic Mexican Roots With New American-Inspired Taco Joint
By Chris Morran April 24, 2014 As everyone knows, Taco Bell’s deeply authentic Mexican roots go back to the company’s humble beginnings in 1843 as Taco Campana, a family business selling flatbreads to hungry travelers outside of Hermosilo. For more than 150 years, the Bell has been a leader in bringing the finest in Mexican cuisine — from the Meximelt to the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Loaded Griller to the Crunchwrap Supreme — to U.S. diners aching for the exotic flavors one can only find south of the border. So it’s surprising that the company has announced a new initiative to create a chain serving “American-inspired” tacos… and booze. [More]

Taco Bell CEO: If Chipotle Is BMW, We're Hyundai
By Chris Morran June 7, 2011 Curiously Australian Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed has no delusions about the product his company sells. Not that he thinks it’s bad food, but that that, well… you often get what you pay for when you buy an $.89 taco. And Creed doesn’t really worry about competing with Chipotle. [More]

Taco Bell President Responds To "Meat Filling" Lawsuit
By Chris Morran January 26, 2011 Earlier this week, the news broke that Taco Bell had been sued over allegations that — according to the USDA — the ground beef advertised in its tacos isn’t ground beef but “meat filling” that contains a bunch of binders and extenders. Yesterday, Greg Creed, the curiously Australian president of the Bell issued a statement on the company’s site. [More]

Get Your Shrimp On At Taco Bell Until April 11

		Creed: 'We don't have a pizza problem'

A new strategy might be in play for the Pizza Hut brand.

 
BOSTON — A year ago at an industry conference, Greg Creed, chief executive officer of Yum! Brands, Inc., said the company’s Pizza Hut business “might be the brand that surprises everybody.” But even as the Louisville, Ky.-based company has churned out positive results in its KFC and Taco Bell units over the past year, the turnaround has been slower to take hold for Pizza Hut. Still, Mr. Creed remains optimistic.

“I think the great thing about Pizza Hut is we don’t have a pizza problem, we don’t have a product problem,” Mr. Creed told participants at the RBC Capital Markets Consumer and Retail Conference held June 1 in Boston.
The issue, he said, is consumers are having problems getting the company’s pizza. Whether it’s ordering the pizza or having the pizza delivered, the issue of easy access has been a major barrier to growth, Mr. Creed said.
“That’s very fixable,” he said, noting the company is putting more effort into executing a digital delivery-centric strategy for the brand in the United States.



Whether it’s ordering pizza or having pizza delivered, the issue of easy access has been a major barrier to growth for Pizza Hut.

 
Pizza Hut has been in so-called turnaround mode for several years. In 2014, the company doubled its number of ingredient and flavor options as part of a comprehensive menu overhaul, which included 10 new crust flavors, 6 new sauces and 11 new recipes. At the time, Yum! executives hoped the new flavors would lure lapsed consumers back to the brand. When that new platform failed to deliver expected results, Pizza Hut turned to a value approach the following year with the introduction of the Triple Treat Box, featuring two medium one-topping pizzas, an order of breadsticks and a dessert for $19.95. The brand also unveiled its version of a value menu, dubbed the $5 Flavor Menu.
While these efforts produced short-term, modest improvement, the business remains challenged.

In May, company executives announced plans to invest approximately $130 million over the next two years to resuscitate the Pizza Hut business in the United States. During the RBC Capital Markets Consumer and Retail Conference on June 1, Mr. Creed hinted at what the company’s resuscitation efforts might include.
“I think as much as KFC is southern-inspired and Taco Bell is Mexican-inspired, we’ve now landed on a position that I think is truly, genuinely what Pizza Hut can own and should own in the pizza category,” he said. “You will see more of that in the coming weeks and months.”

Bell on the Ball


Greg Creed, CEO of Taco Bell, talks about the company’s secret salt reductions, why he’s not afraid of Chipotle, and oh yeah, that pesky beef lawsuit.

A group of cartoon superheroes dubbed the Super Delicious Ingredient Force that lives in a “Fortress of Flavor” will never be the stars of a marketing campaign for Panera Bread. Chipotle CEO Steve Ells will never say that a $2.69 taco is expensive. And it’s highly unlikely that McDonald’s will issue a public statement thanking the Center for Science in the Public Interest for its legal action against Happy Meals.
But then again, none of those chains present quite the quick-serve offering that Taco Bell does—not in product, not in value, and not in branding. The 49-year-old Mexican category leader marches to the beat of its own drum, comfortable serving cheap food to a younger demographic that finds characters named Captain Enchilada Sauce and Steak Maximus funny.
Even company CEO Greg Creed is not your typical close-to-the-vest, stick-to-the-script kind of leader. The 53-year-old Aussie is chatty, honest, and intimately rooted in his company; he says he’s Facebook friends with half of his corporate staff, and his first reaction to the January class action lawsuit filed against the company over the contents of its beef was to be sad for the reputations of both Taco Bell and its 130,000-plus workforce.
If Creed has a secret to how Taco Bell is maintaining its success without succumbing to the china-dishing, latte-serving, organic-touting trends of the quick-serve industry, it’s this: “If you understand what you as a brand stand for, if you understand the role that your brand plays in people’s lives, and how you make their lives better, then I believe you can be successful in good times and bad,” he says.
Of course, the last few years have been what many in the quick-serve industry would call bad times. When the economy tanked in 2008, so did customers’ discretionary incomes and willingness to spend on food outside the home.
With already some of the lowest prices in the industry, though, Taco Bell was not forced to do what many in the restaurant industry rushed to at the height of the recession—deep discounting. The Yum! Brands concept was already offering about 10 items for $1 or less on its Why Pay More! menu, and the $2 Meal Deals unveiled in 2010 gave customers four options that paired a burrito or taco with a drink and chips—a move that marked the two-buck price point as a magic number across the industry.
Still, now that the economy is improving and many restaurant companies are laying off their price slashing, Creed says that cheap food will continue to be Taco Bell’s strategy.
“I think there’s a large part of society that is still struggling, and I think, from our perspective, that if you can give people really distinctive taste at unbeatable value, you can be very successful, both in the short term and the long term,” he says. “I think that’s what underpins our past success and what we believe will be our success going forward.”
Yes, value—one of those terms, like fresh, seemingly without a firm definition but which gets tossed around like dough in a pizzeria. But Creed does have a definition—or three—for fresh and he holds Taco Bell to its standards in every new menu item the chain rolls out.
“There’s what we call price value, and price value is where there’s a really low price—89-cent tacos, 99-cent burritos—where you’re not paying a lot of money,” he says. “Then there’s what we call abundant value, and abundant value is what I get divided by what I pay. … The third one is what I would call a quality value, and probably a good example of that right now is our shrimp taco and burrito that we’re promoting.”
The Pacific Shrimp Taco, along with the Pacific Shrimp Burrito, rolled out earlier this year. It contains six shrimp tossed in a chipotle marinade and served on shredded lettuce, salsa, and avocado ranch sauce atop a flour tortilla.
“The taco costs $2.69, which, considering we’re the home of the 89-, 99-cent tacos, is quite expensive,” Creed says. “But people are saying, ‘I can’t get six shrimp for $2.69 anywhere in the world.’ We call that quality value because the quality of the shrimp—the fact that we offer shrimp, the fact that you can get six of them, and the fact that it’s $2.69—is still amazing value.
“We say at Taco Bell, ‘We make value matter,’ whether you’re paying 99 cents, $2.69 for a shrimp taco, [$5 for] a $5 Box, or [$10 for] a $10 Party Pack with 12 tacos,” he says. “We’ve got to make sure value matters at whatever price point you want to participate at.”
Despite the low price points, Taco Bell continues to perform as the No. 1 Mexican quick serve—to an astounding degree. In 2010, the chain did $6.9 billion in U.S. sales across 5,634 stores, good for sixth place on this publication’s annual QSR 50 list. Its AUV of $1.3 million was nearly three times as much as Subway’s.
The No. 2 Mexican quick-serve player, Del Taco, sits at No. 36 on the QSR 50, doing $579 million in U.S. sales across 522 stores.
Companies like Del Taco, Taco John’s, and Taco Bueno, however, are not the fast feeders Creed considers competition; that would be companies like McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s, which Creed says Taco Bell competes with on the convenience front.
The Mexican category, though, is building steam quickly. Taco Bell no longer enjoys the total domination it once did in the field; brands like Chipotle, Qdoba, and Moe’s Southwest Grill are carrying the segment into the fast-casual realm to much success.
Yet Creed remains unwavering in his belief that Taco Bell fits a special niche in the marketplace, one that is not in danger of succumbing to the upgrades of the fast-casual industry. For starters, Creed says, some people just want to pay less for Mexican food—“When you go to a fast casual, you’re paying $8 or $8.50 for a burrito,” he says. “There are a lot of people who don’t have $8.50 to pay for a burrito”—not to mention Taco Bell serves a much different, lower-income demographic than Chipotle does.
