Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

		STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CAROL M. BROWNER
		January 28, 1999 




STATEMENT OF
				THE HONORABLE CAROL M. BROWNER
				ADMINISTRATOR
				U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
				BEFORE THE
				COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
				UNITED STATES SENATE

				January 28, 1999 

Thank you Mr. Chairman, and other members of the Committee, for 
				inviting me here to discuss this Administration's global environmental 
				objectives, EPA's international mission and our role in defining 
				the interface between trade and environment policies. I would 
				like to take this opportunity to identify for the Committee the 
				goals of our strong international program and the many ways we 
				work to achieve those goals both within and outside the trade 
				agenda. I hope to assist you in attaining an appreciation for 
				EPA's interest in trade and environment issues and to make progress 
				towards a common approach for developing a new consensus on these 
				issues.

 EPA's International Mission 

EPA is a leader in the nation's efforts to protect and preserve 
				public health and the vitality of natural ecosystems in this country. 
				My Agency is committed to achieving these goals by reducing risks 
				to human health and the environment, preventing pollution, and 
				fostering environmentally sound and sustainable economic development 
				in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 
			  International cooperation is a key element in EPA's ability to 
				achieve this mission. The United States faces significant challenges 
				in protecting the health of its citizens and its natural resources 
				from environmental hazards. In today's world, since pollution 
				does not honor national boundaries, overcoming these challenges 
				requires the cooperation of other countries. Some examples include: 
			  

Cross-border air, water and waste pollution from 
				  Mexico, Canada and other areas affect the health, environment 
				  and well-being of American citizens living along borders as 
				  well as other areas of the United States. 
Improper use of chemicals abroad can affect the 
				  safety of food and other products imported into the United States. 
Health and environmental benefits resulting from 
				  the multi-billion dollar U.S. investment by industry under the 
				  Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of stratospheric ozone depleting 
				  compounds could be undermined by failure to control production 
				  or use of these chemicals in other countries, such as China, 
				  India or Russia. 
Pollution of the marine environment in the wider 
				  Caribbean region can damage U.S. fisheries and coral reefs and 
				  jeopardize tourism and other livelihoods. 
Pollution of the oceans and irreversible loss 
				  of species and habitat worldwide damage natural systems critical 
				  to our well-being and quality of life, and deprive us of commercially 
				  valuable and potentially life-saving genetic materials.
The long-range transport of persistent organic 
				  pollutants like DDT, chlordane and polychlorinated biphenyls 
				  (PCBs) can adversely affect health and environment in the United 
				  States.

One of the major goals of EPA's Strategic Plan under the Government 
				Performance and Results Act is aimed at reducing global risks 
				that affect health and environment in the United States. EPA's 
				efforts under this goal are grouped in five major areas: (1) protecting 
				North American ecosystems, including marine and Arctic environments, 
				(2) meeting U.S. commitments under the U.N. Framework Convention 
				on Climate Change, (3) reducing stratospheric ozone depletion 
				in conformance with U.S. commitments under the Montreal Protocol 
				on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, (4) protecting public 
				health and ecosystems from persistent organic pollutants that 
				circulate at global and regional scales, and (5) strengthening 
				environmental protection worldwide and achieving cleaner and more-effective 
				environmental protection in the United States. 
			  EPA's international environmental programs help protect the health 
				and environment of American citizens. They enlist the cooperation 
				of other nations in reducing transboundary and global environmental 
				threats to the United States and reduce the cost of the nation's 
				environmental protection. They also serve the nation's broad foreign 
				policy, economic and national security interests.
Reducing Environmental Threats Along Our Borders
Over half of the U.S. population lives in the 19 States that 
				form our borders with Mexico and Canada. Nowhere are the benefits 
				of EPA's international programs more apparent than along our common 
				borders with Mexico and Canada and in the Arctic and wider Caribbean 
				region. 
			  In 1993, this Administration concluded the U.S.-Mexico Border 
				Environmental Cooperation Agreement, which created the Border 
				Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American 
				Development Bank (NADBank). In addition, the Administration negotiated 
				the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. These 
				efforts have led to specific environmental gains in all three 
				countries. NAFTA highlighted the problems unique to the U.S.-Mexico 
				border and, as a result, Congress, border state legislators, federal 
				and state agencies have devoted their efforts and resources to 
				effectively resolving these problems in strong cooperation with 
				Mexico without interfering with the trade agenda. 
			  .  The BECC and NADBank have been established to certify 
				and fund environmental infrastructure projects. Fifteen BECC-certified 
				projects, worth a combined $350 million and serving 3.5 million 
				U.S. and Mexican citizens are now under construction or complete. 
				The institutions, using their own and EPA resources, are developing 
				additional projects for future construction. 
			  .  Since 1995, EPA has provided $425 million for border 
				drinking water and wastewater infrastructure construction, as 
				well as $200 million specifically for colonias water facilities. 
			  .  Border XXI, the binational border environment plan, 
				brings together many federal, state, and local agencies on both 
				sides of the border, as well as Tribal entities and non-government 
				organizations to ensure cooperation to maximize resources and 
				avoid duplicative efforts. In advancing the goal of sustainable 
				development, Border XXI emphasizes public involvement in its development 
				and implementation and works to build capacity and decentralize 
				environmental management. 
			  .  The second phase of Border XXI includes efforts 
				to address pressing health and natural resource needs. The addition 
				of the Environmental Health, the Natural Resources, and the Environmental 
				Information Resources Workgroups to the Border XXI Program resulted 
				in the participation of Health and Human Services Department and 
				the Department of Interior. 
			  .  The ten border states (U.S. and Mexico) are cooperating 
				by developing state-to-state strategic plans to address the degradation 
				of the border environment. 
			  .  Border XXI places an emphasis on measuring the progress 
				of border environmental efforts which has resulted in a process 
				to develop environmental indicators for the U.S.-Mexico border 
				area. The first Indicators Report was released in July 1998. 
			  .  A binational joint advisory committee representing 
				various sectors of the public was established to provide recommendations 
				to the Air Workgroup on air pollution improvement efforts in the 
				El Paso-Ciudad Juarez-Do�a Ana County air basin. 
			  .  The United States has jointly developed an emissions 
				inventory methodology with Mexico, which Mexico adopted. As a 
				result, Mexico is now systematically developing compatible air 
				pollution emission inventories all over the country, including 
				cities along the border. 
			  .  Continuous air monitoring data is now being collected 
				in three priority areas-El Paso-Juarez-Sunland Park, Imperial-Mexicali, 
				and San Diego-Tijuana. 
			  .  The Good Neighbor Environmental Board and Region 
				1 of the Mexican National Advisory Council for Sustainable Development-the 
				two national public advisory committees on U.S.-Mexico border 
				issues-are working individually and jointly to develop recommendations 
				on a number of sustainable development policy issues. 
			  .  Regional subgroups, such as the Environmental Enforcement 
				and Compliance subgroups, are being established along the border 
				to facilitate the cooperation of various entities working in the 
				border area on specific projects. The regional subgroups also 
				allow opportunities for the public to have input into environmental 
				improvements. 
			  .  Fourteen sister city pairs along the border are 
				developing joint contingency plans for chemical emergency response. 
				To date, three pairs of sister cities have developed and signed 
				binational joint plans and several others are preparing or finalizing 
				their plans. 
			  .  Mexican and U.S. federal entities are cooperating 
				in the area of environmental enforcement and compliance through 
				the sharing of information and through training and technical 
				and legal consultations on many aspects. In particular, voluntary 
				environmental compliance, including environmental auditing and 
				adoption of pollution prevention practices and technologies, is 
				promoted by environmental agencies on both sides of the border. 
			  .  Many efforts have been made to expand availability 
				of environmental information and to increase public participation 
				in environmental decision making in the border area. Among these 
				efforts is the creation of a bilingual Border XXI web site as 
				a mechanism to increase public access to information. 
			  Long-standing cooperation with Canada has resulted in corresponding 
				environmental gains along our northern border. Benefitting from 
				the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and other cooperative 
				agreements, mercury levels in fish in Lakes Michigan, Huron and 
				Erie have dropped by more than 75 percent since 1970. Phosphorous 
				loadings into Lake Erie decreased by more than 50 percent over 
				the same time period, improving water quality and raising fish 
				stocks. EPA and Environment Canada are working closely with public 
				and private interests on both sides of the border to eliminate 
				health and environmental risks from persistent organic pollutants 
				in the Great Lakes. 
			  U.S. and Canadian efforts to achieve the goals of the U.S.-Canada 
				Air Quality Agreement resulted in reductions of sulfate wet deposition 
				over eastern North America by over 20 percent of 1979 levels. 
				U.S. and Canadian federal, British Columbia provincial and Washington 
				state agencies are cooperating to achieve shared goals for the 
				Puget Sound-Straits of Georgia Basin eco-region. Their top four 
				priorities are minimizing habitat loss, protecting marine plants 
				and animals, minimizing introduction of non-native species, and 
				creating marine protected areas. Joint contingency planning with 
				Mexico and Canada is helping prevent and ensure appropriate response 
				capabilities for chemical accidents or other hazardous spills 
				along inland borders. 
			  
Reducing Global and Regional Environmental Risk 
			  
Global threats have local effects since they can affect the health 
				and well-being of every U.S. citizen. Depletion of the stratospheric 
				ozone layer increases the amount of the sun's ultraviolet radiation 
				reaching the earth's surface, thereby increasing risk of skin 
				cancer, cataracts and suppression of human immune systems. Pollution 
				of the oceans originating in other countries threatens health 
				and environment along U.S. coasts. Similarly, the United States 
				is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change caused by global 
				greenhouse gas emissions. Even if we are able to reduce our emissions 
				to 1990 levels (as called for in the Framework Convention on Climate 
				Change), we believe there is a delayed effect from already accumulated 
				emissions which will continue to effect global temperatures and 
				result in rises in sea levels through the next century. Loss of 
				biological diversity is damaging the health of ecosystems and 
				depleting the world's commercially valuable and potentially life-saving 
				genetic materials. The global ramifications of the nuclear accident 
				at Chernobyl underscored U.S. vulnerability to the results of 
				environmental mismanagement in other countries. Environmental 
				problems like ozone depletion and water pollution also have adverse 
				economic effects for industries like agriculture and fishing. 
			  The Administration is committed to meeting the challenge of these 
				global environmental problems, working at the global, multilateral, 
				regional, and bilateral levels. EPA plays a role, in coordination 
				with the Department of State, in negotiating certain global and 
				regional environmental agreements. The Agency also, in accordance 
				with its statutory authority, draws on its policy and technical 
				expertise to implement international agreements and programs on 
				global and regional environmental problems directly affecting 
				the United States. The Agency was a leading policy and technical 
				voice in the international negotiations on the Montreal Protocol 
				on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. EPA was a key participant 
				on the U.S. delegation to many technical working group meetings, 
				and had lead responsibility for domestic implementation of the 
				Protocol through the promulgation of regulations under the Clean 
				Air Act. The Agency is also instrumental in carrying out U.S. 
				responsibilities related to the provision of technical assistance 
				to developing-country Parties to the Protocol. EPA is has a leading 
				role in the inter-agency effort to reduce illegal exports and 
				imports of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) through enforcement cooperation 
				with other countries. 
			  EPA also provides policy and technical leadership in international 
				efforts to implement the Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
				as well as international agreements to prevent and reduce pollution 
				of the marine environment from dumping, vessels and land-based 
				sources. The recent agreement under the London Convention to ban 
				the sea disposal of radioactive and industrial wastes, for example, 
				helps protect U.S. coastal areas, fisheries and human health. 
				Through U.S.G. activities like the U.S. Country Studies Program 
				and the United States Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI), 
				EPA assists developing countries in identifying innovative, cost-effective 
				ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing private sector 
				investment in developing countries while enhancing environmental 
				and human health benefits are goals of the USIJI, the Country 
				Studies Program and related programs. These activities stimulate 
				the development and diffusion of clean, energy-efficient technologies 
				in developing countries, while lowering the cost of greenhouse 
				gas reductions to the U.S. industry. 
			  EPA has been a global leader in international efforts to control 
				the long-range transport of persistent organic pollutants, such 
				as DDT, chlordane and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The Agency 
				recently helped secure international consensus on the need for 
				a legally binding convention on these pollutants. Such a convention 
				will enlist the cooperation of nations in limiting the production 
				of chemicals long banned or restricted for use in the United States 
				and whose continued use abroad poses a threat to health and environment 
				in this country. EPA played a major role in international negotiations 
				resulting in the adoption of the prior informed consent (PIC) 
				agreement for the transboundary movement of certain toxic chemicals 
				and pesticides. 
			  Similarly, EPA has a key role on implementing the Global Programme 
				of Action on Land-Based Sources of Marine Pollution adopted at 
				the Washington Conference in 1995, and in negotiations on a Land-Based 
				Marine Pollution Protocol under the Cartagena Convention for the 
				Wider Caribbean Region. The development and implementation of 
				effective controls on land-based sources of marine pollution such 
				as outfalls and runoff will go far toward advancing important 
				U.S. environmental and economic interests. Clean beaches and healthy 
				coral reefs, for example, are very important to the tourist, fishing 
				and recreation industries. 
			  This Administration will continue efforts to improve regional 
				environmental cooperation, and to build such cooperation arrangements 
				in regions targeted for trade liberalization, such as APEC and 
				the FTAA. In the Western Hemisphere, we are leaders in the follow 
				up to the Miami Summit Action Plan and the 1996 Bolivia Sustainable 
				Development Summit: 
			  .  In the area of biodiversity, USAID is initiating 
				or expanding projects on environmental health and education, and 
				on the Central American Biodiversity Corridor, a biodiversity 
				Internet site (in cooperation with UNDP). In the energy sector, 
				DOE has focused its resources on renewable energy, technology 
				exchange and rural electrification. 
			  .  EPA and the Department of Justice are cooperating 
				to develop a network of experts in environmental law and enforcement 
				to explore strengthening laws and regulations in the hemisphere. 
				EPA and Justice are also examining ways to address water issues 
				-- both clean drinking water and waste water -- and land-based 
				sources of marine pollution. 
			  .  NOAA, working under a cooperative agreement with 
				USAID, is considering the establishment of a Marine Environment 
				Center in the Caribbean Basin. 
			  .  Regarding transparency and enhancing the participation 
				of civil society, with our leadership, the Bolivia Summit has 
				mandated the OAS to develop an Inter-American Strategy for Public 
				Participation in Sustainable Development Policy-making. 
			  With respect to the Asia Pacific region, our leadership role 
				on environmental issues will continue: 
			  .  The United States has taken the lead on implementing 
				two of the sustainable development initiatives launched at the 
				July 1996 APEC Environment Ministerial. 
			  
  1) "clean production", whose goals are to reduce 
				  pollution in key industry sectors by promoting appropriate cleaner 
				  production technologies, policies and practices while also striving 
				  to achieve broader adoption of cleaner production technologies 
				  through institutional and professional partnerships; and 
			  

  2) the marine environment, whose goals are to develop 
				  integrated approaches to coastal management, prevent, reduce 
				  and control marine pollution and manage marine resources in 
				  sustainable way. (The initiative is "sustainable cities"). 
			  
.  The United States is working to integrate environmental 
				issues within the scope of other APEC working groups, e.g., the 
				energy working group is looking at issues of energy efficiency 
				and clean technology. 
			  Elevating the Quality and Reducing the Cost of Environmental 
				Protection in the United States
The United States is a world leader in environmental protection, 
				with significant expertise residing in both the public and private 
				sectors. Cooperative research and regulatory development enables 
				the United States to share the costs of environmental protection 
				efforts and to benefit from scientific and technological breakthroughs 
				in other countries, thereby elevating the quality and reducing 
				the cost of environmental protection in the United States. 
			  Cooperative research with several countries, including Canada, 
				Germany, Sweden, Japan, China, and India, has yielded valuable 
				information to the United States at a fraction of the cost of 
				collecting and analyzing the data here. In a cooperative study 
				with China, for example, EPA was able to assess the loss of lung 
				function in children due to their exposure to coarse and fine 
				air-borne particulate matter. Joint testing with Germany on the 
				development of thermal destruction techniques for hazardous waste 
				saved the U.S. taxpayer millions of dollars and accelerated the 
				U.S. domestic program in this area three to four years. Shared 
				testing through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
				Development (OECD) of over 700 high production volume chemicals 
				greatly reduces the cost and administrative burden of chemical 
				testing in the United States. OECD's long-standing Test Guidelines 
				harmonization program for toxic chemicals data has been expanded 
				to explicitly consider pesticides data, thereby leading to even 
				greater resource savings for national regulatory agencies and 
				industry as well as more consistent scientific and regulatory 
				conclusions. Cooperation with the European Union is helping to 
				enhance the effectiveness of ecolabeling as a market-based environmental 
				policy tool. 
			  EPA is also working with many developed countries in sharing 
				environmental management expertise on new, non-regulatory mechanisms 
				for protecting the environment. Other countries are extremely 
				interested in our experience with voluntary, non-regulatory programs 
				like the Common Sense Initiative, a multi-stakeholder approach 
				to environmental protection. In addition, as EPA moves away from 
				the medium-by-medium approach of the past toward a more integrated 
				view of the environment, it can learn much from the experience 
				of other countries that have already applied such techniques. 
				Swedish and Dutch authorities, for example, have been implementing 
				multi-media systems of environmental protection for many years. 
				Similarly, experience in Germany and other countries in rehabilitating 
				derelict industrial sites offers valuable lessons for the "Brownfields" 
				program in the United States. 
			  Serving Broader National Objectives
As emphasized by the General Accounting Office in its recent 
				review of international environmental programs across the U.S. 
				government, "EPA's international programs also serve important 
				U.S. economic, foreign policy, and security interests." Working 
				closely with other U.S. agencies, for example, EPA has actively 
				supported regional cooperation under the auspices of the Middle 
				East Peace Process Multilateral Working Group, including bringing 
				together regional parties to cooperate on reducing risks from 
				pesticides, small community wastewater, and preventing and responding 
				to chemical accidents or oil spills. 
			  The Agency's emphasis on community-based environmental management 
				plays an important role in encouraging the development of more 
				responsible, participatory decision-making in countries around 
				the world. Reduced environmental problems can relieve pressures 
				for illegal immigration, promote economic and political stability, 
				and serve other national security interests. 
			  
EPA's Interest in Trade and Environment Issues 
			  
Export Credit Agencies
Our national programs dealing with trade and investment abroad 
				should complement the effort to raise the environmental quality 
				and sustainability of the multinational investments made by the 
				U.S. taxpayer. At Congress' direction and with EPA technical support, 
				the US Treasury Department has made sure that the lending and 
				guarantee policies of the multilateral development banks assess 
				and address the environmental and social impacts of the projects 
				of their borrowers. This is good business, as well as sound policy, 
				because sustainable growth ensures that the markets for US goods 
				will be there not just tomorrow but also the day after tomorrow. 
			  For the same reason, my agency has supported the development 
				of minimum environmental standards by the US Export-Import bank 
				and the effort to harmonize the environmental standards of our 
				major trading partners upward. We can all be proud of these examples 
				of global U.S. leadership. The process of dialogue has been slow, 
				at times disappointingly so. The good news is that recent European 
				elections appear to have brought greater receptivity from our 
				friends and competitors to the idea that we should not compete 
				at the expense of the environment. 
			  
Environmental Technology Export Promotion 
			  
Technical cooperation has played an important role in foreign 
				policy initiatives in Latin America and with Mexico, China, India, 
				Russia, and South Africa. EPA's technical assistance and training 
				programs create demand -- and markets -- for environmental technologies 
				and expertise, thereby enhancing commercial opportunities for 
				U.S. business and industry and creating high-wage jobs for American 
				citizens. 
			  Senior private sector individuals and groups have recently reaffirmed 
				the key role EPA's international technology and capacity-building 
				programs play in creating commercial opportunities for U.S. suppliers 
				of environmental technologies and expertise. In so doing, they 
				have differentiated the export assistance (supply-side) role of 
				the Department of Commerce, Export-Import Bank and other export 
				promotion agencies from EPA's role in creating demand for U.S. 
				technologies and expertise through the development of environmental 
				standards, institutions and human resource capabilities. EPA's 
				short-term technical assistance to the Royal Thai Government, 
				for example, not only helped solve a pressing health and environmental 
				problem in the Mae Moh Valley, it also led to the sale of almost 
				$200 million for U.S.-made air pollution monitoring and control 
				equipment. 
			  In the Report which accompanied EPA's FY 1998 appropriations 
				bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee urged EPA to "play a 
				stronger role in enhancing opportunities for industry to export 
				environmental technologies to other countries." It specifically 
				directed the Agency to "develop a strategy to coordinate and promote 
				the export of environmental technology and services and coordinate 
				such activities with other Federal agencies." In response to this 
				appropriations report, EPA this past October published a Report 
				to Congress entitled "EPA Strategy For Promoting U.S. Environmental 
				Exports." The Report noted that EPA's international initiatives 
				help the U.S. environmental technology sector expand its export 
				base and that EPA's export-enhancing activities can be grouped 
				into five general categories: 
			  
Creating Demand for U.S. Technologies and Services: 
				EPA's international training, technical assistance and other capacity 
				building programs help to drive the demand for U.S. environmental 
				goods and services. Joint funding for environmental training of 
				foreign officials, for example, has helped strengthen environmental 
				management capabilities worldwide while leading to over $150 million 
				in sales for small and medium-sized companies in the United States. 
			  

Cooperation With Other Federal Agencies: EPA 
				works with other Federal agencies and departments, such as Ex-Im 
				Bank and DOC, to help match U.S. technology and service providers 
				with opportunities which arise from our capacity-building programs. 
				EPA also participates as a partner in AID's Asia Environmental 
				Partnership and co-chairs, along with DOC, the Environmental Trade 
				Working Group.

Cooperation With The U.S. Private Sector: EPA 
				works both with intermediary organizations such as the National 
				Association of State Development Agencies and directly with U.S. 
				private sector firms to organize technology demonstrations in 
				other countries, strengthen technology development and dissemination 
				through programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research 
				grants and the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) programs, 
				and to direct U.S. businesses toward specialized export assistance 
				at local, state, federal and international levels.

Strong Environmental Standards: By encouraging 
				the adoption of strong environmental standards at bilateral, regional 
				and global levels, EPA helps to drive the demand for increasingly 
				sophisticated environmental technologies.

Removing International Barriers to the Flow of Environmental 
				Goods and Services: Through fora such as NAFTA, APEC and the 
				WTO, EPA is working with its partner Federal agencies to reduce 
				tariffs for environmental goods and services. We are also working 
				with these other agencies to reduce non-tariff trade barriers.
EPA's reputation as the world's foremost national environmental 
				agency has been a key element in the success of our international 
				programs. Equally important, however, has been our reputation 
				for honesty and objectivity. EPA is careful to stress that we 
				do not endorse particular private sector firms or seek to promote 
				certain goods or services. Our programs form a foundation upon 
				which export promotion agencies such as DOC and programs such 
				as the Asia Environmental Partnership may build. In essence, EPA 
				helps to foster the rising global demand for environmental technologies; 
				our partner agencies help U.S. business to fill the demand. 
			  The Trade Institutions
In the 1999 State of the Union address, President Clinton said 
				"we must ensure that ordinary citizens benefit from trade -- a 
				trade that promotes the dignity of work, and the rights of workers, 
				and protects the environment...[w]e have got to put a human face 
				on the global economy." Our goal in seeking to ensure that trade 
				negotiations support protection of the environment is to do just 
				that -- put a human face on the global economy by ensuring that 
				we continue to protect the health, safety and environment of our 
				citizens. 
			  EPA works extensively with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
				(USTR), particularly its Office of Environment and Natural Resources, 
				to ensure that U.S. international trade policies are mutually 
				supportive with environmental policies, reflecting the Administration's 
				continuing commitment to sustainable economic growth with strong 
				health and environmental standards. EPA is represented on the 
				sub-cabinet Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG) and the Trade Policy 
				Staff Committee (TPSC), coordinated by USTR and responsible for 
				the development of U.S. international trade policy. 
			  Through my Agency's participation in the negotiation of the NAFTA, 
				the Uruguay Round Agreements Establishing the WTO and, most recently, 
				the ongoing Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiations, 
				EPA has worked to ensure that U.S. obligations under international 
				trade agreements do not hamper, but rather further, the ability 
				of federal and state governments to maintain and enforce high 
				levels of domestic environmental protection that we deem appropriate. 
				The dispute settlement bodies of trade institutions should not 
				be able to second-guess levels of protection that countries determine 
				to be necessary to protect their citizens. President Clinton reiterated 
				this goal at the WTO 50th Anniversary in May 1998 when he said 
				"international trade rules must permit sovereign nations to exercise 
				their right to set protective standards for health, safety and 
				the environment and biodiversity". 
			  As we approach the 1999 WTO Ministerial to be held in the United 
				States in November, we have a platform in the greatest country 
				on earth to inspire our trading partners to fulfill the President's 
				call for ensuring that "we do more to make sure that this new 
				economy lifts living standards around the world, and that spirited 
				economic competition among nations never becomes a race to the 
				bottom in environmental protections...we should level up, not 
				down." WTO rules should be consistent with leveling environmental, 
				health, or safety standards upwards, i.e., towards more protective 
				standards. 
			  International harmonization of good laboratory practices, test 
				guidelines and mutual acceptance of data for industrial chemicals 
				and pesticides means more efficient data development by industry 
				and greater assurance of the quality of data EPA uses in determining 
				acceptable use of these products. The mutual acceptance of data 
				for risk assessment purposes must now be expanded beyond countries 
				of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to 
				include emerging markets in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe. 
				EPA's efforts to promote the "leveling up" of health and environmental 
				standards improves health and environmental conditions, and also 
				protect U.S. business who already must comply with high domestic 
				standards, while respecting its international obligations. 
			  There are other ways to maintain the high levels of health and 
				environmental protection in the United States and to share these 
				levels with other nations. The first is to maintain our right 
				to deny entry of products that do not meet our health and environmental 
				standards. In order to adequately protect the health of American 
				citizens, we must maintain our right to prohibit entry of products 
				-- particularly food products -- that do not meet our standards. 
				Certain products (e.g., pesticides, foods with pesticide residues) 
				must be approved before they can be marketed. Consistent with 
				our statutory obligations (e.g., FIFRA, TSCA, FFDCA), the United 
				States will continue to prohibit the entry or use of these products 
				unless the exporting country/producer provides information that 
				the product meets our health, safety or environmental requirements. 
			  EPA also tries to achieve its goal through its international 
				programs on safe pesticide use, which help to improve the quality 
				of the U.S. food supply. Many off-season fruit and vegetables 
				are imported from developing countries whose health and environmental 
				inspection and regulatory systems are considerably less stringent 
				than those in the United States. By working with foreign health 
				and environmental protection agencies and agricultural producers, 
				EPA is able to promote safer pesticide use and food production 
				practices in countries producing a significant amount of export 
				crops for the U.S. market. Since 1991, for example, EPA has provided 
				technical assistance on pesticide management to many countries 
				in Central America. Much of the produce grown in Central America 
				is intended for the U.S. market. 
			  North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation
As you are probably aware, I represent the United States, in 
				consultation with the other federal agencies, on the Council of 
				the CEC. To date, the CEC has focused its cooperative work program 
				on environmental issues important to the North American region. 
				This cooperative work program has been very successful in creating 
				dialogue among our nations, fostering the exchange of information, 
				and causing the development of cooperative plans of action on 
				many issues. Last year, my counterparts and I began the development 
				of a more comprehensive trade and environment program in the CEC 
				intended to build on our project looking at the environmental 
				effects of the NAFTA, increase our understanding of our trade 
				and environment issues generally, and specifically work with civil 
				society to find useful solutions. 
			  The U.S. and its NAFTA partners have determined that some transboundary 
				environmental issues related to Mexico and Canada are better addressed 
				on a regional scale through the Commission for Environmental Cooperation 
				(CEC), which was established under the North American Agreement 
				on Environmental Cooperation, rather than bilaterally. For instance, 
				the three parties have developed regional actions plans for the 
				elimination or sound management of DDT, mercury, PCBs and chlordane, 
				and are negotiating procedures to notify and assess transboundary 
				environmental impacts of significant federal actions. They are 
				also considering a conservation strategy for North American migratory 
				songbirds. The CEC has facilitated cooperation among the North 
				American nations on several other issues such as environmental 
				enforcement; development of a North American pollutant release 
				inventory; regional greenhouse gas emissions trading; and regional 
				implementation of global environmental agreements. 
			  The positive focus on the cooperative work program may have diminished 
				the need for the Part V dispute settlement mechanism, which could 
				eventually lead to revocation of NAFTA benefits. In fact, no country 
				has raised an issue under Part V and to our knowledge, no government 
				has been subject to public pressure to do so. The Article 14 citizen's 
				submission process, on the other hand, has been used many times 
				by NGOs in all three countries and is quite successful. The ultimate 
				outcome of this process, if the CEC Secretariat decides to take 
				it to completion for any submission, is a factual record on an 
				assertion that one government has failed to effectively enforce 
				its domestic environmental law. Thus, the process enables citizens 
				to question the environmental enforcement actions of any government 
				in North America and to get an answer to those questions. 
			  This leads me to what I find to be one of the most useful aspects 
				of the NAFTA side agreement: the commitment of the three governments 
				to effectively enforce their existing domestic environmental laws. 
				I believe the NAFTA environmental review process was critical 
				to assessing the environmental regimes of our trading partners 
				early in the trade negotiations. This review enabled us to enter 
				into the NAFTA with a better understanding of what the environmental 
				repercussions of that agreement were, without imposing any of 
				our own standards abroad. 
			  The United States is committed both to ensuring that the trade 
				agreements we negotiate are consistent with our environmental 
				objectives, and to ensuring that Congress and the public are informed 
				about the possible impact of such agreements on the environment. 
				At the beginning of the NAFTA negotiations, the Administration 
				issued a study evaluating potential environmental effects of a 
				trilateral free trade agreement. At the conclusion of both the 
				NAFTA and the Uruguay Round negotiations, the Administration issued 
				a reports describing how environmental issues had been addressed 
				in the agreements, and outlining the potential environmental implications 
				of those agreements. 
			  As the United States has entered into negotiations on new trade 
				agreements, we have sought to include mechanisms for considering 
				the environmental implications of those agreements. For instance, 
				as part of the US-E.U. Transatlantic Economic Partnership initiative 
				(TEP), we are creating an Environment Working Group that has been 
				tasked, inter alia, with informing trade negotiators of the potential 
				impact of other TEP negotiations on health, safety, and environmental 
				interests. In addition, we have been working with the Secretariat 
				of the NAFTA Commission on Environmental Cooperation on a methodology 
				to identify the environmental effects of trade liberalization. 
			  Multilaterally, in the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment 
				(CTE), the United States has shared our positive experience with 
				the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round reviews and pressed for agreement 
				in the WTO/CTE that governments should review the environmental 
				implications of trade agreements. With your support, EPA stands 
				ready to offer appropriate technical cooperation and assistance 
				to help partners strengthen their environmental regimes. 
			  Transparency and Public Participation
Finally, the CEC demonstrates the value of public participation 
				to other international institutions. President Clinton, in his 
				May speech at the WTO, proposed that the WTO "provide a forum 
				where business, labour, environmental and consumer groups can 
				speak out and help guide further evolution of the WTO." In my 
				experience, an openness to the public benefits international decision-making. 
				At each of the annual CEC Council sessions, my Canadian and Mexican 
				counterparts and I spend a few hours in an open meeting with the 
				public to hear their concerns and ideas regarding the implementation 
				of the NAFTA side agreement so that our decisions are informed 
				by public comment. Each CEC Party has established National Advisory 
				Committees so that each delegation stays in touch with its own 
				public. The Joint Public Advisory Committee, a senior level group 
				that advises all three governments, is actually one arm of the 
				CEC itself. When appropriate, representatives of the advisory 
				committees have been invited into the Council sessions. These 
				types of public participation efforts are useful and should be 
				models for other institutions. 
			  It is my hope that the WTO ministerial to be held on American 
				soil can promote transparency and public participation in a future 
				WTO round of negotiations. The President has called for an opening 
				of the process at the WTO. He specifically asks that "hearings 
				by the WTO be open to the public, and all briefs by the parties 
				be made publicly available,... that the WTO provide the opportunity 
				for stakeholders to convey their views, such as the ability to 
				file amicus briefs." I look forward to a high-level meeting that 
				brings together the trade and environment ministers in order to 
				provide strong direction on these and other issues important to 
				the environment in the WTO and comparable fora. 
			  Let me close by saying that I believe the trade and environment 
				issue needs to be addressed on a dual track: we need to tear down 
				barriers, open markets and expand trade, but at the same time 
				we need to make parallel progress on environmental protection. 
				EPA's international program, as described above, aims to achieve 
				this parallel progress through technical assistance, environmental 
				technology export promotion and international cooperation. I appreciate 
				your continued support for these efforts. Thank you for holding 
				these timely hearings on this very important issue.

Carol M. Browner, in full Carol Martha Browner  (born Dec. 16, 1955, Miami, Fla., U.S.), American attorney and politician who served as director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA; 1993–2001) in the administration of Pres. Bill Clinton and as director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy (2009–11) under Pres. Barack Obama.Browner grew up in southern Florida, and the Everglades were a short trip from her home. The proximity of such an extensive and diverse wetland illustrated to her the importance of environmental responsibility. Browner received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida in 1977, and she remained there to earn her law degree in 1979. She entered politics in 1986 as the chief legal aide for environmental issues for U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles of Florida. In 1988 she moved to Tennessee after being named legislative director for Al Gore, who was then a U.S. senator. Three years later Browner returned to Florida, where she led the state’s environmental regulation efforts.When President Clinton took office in 1993, Browner was named director of the EPA, and she held the post until Clinton left office in 2001. She was an advocate for what she called “common sense” in environmental regulation. She worked to pass restrictions on carbon and particulate emissions, and she stepped up enforcement of existing environmental and public health laws. Browner and Vice President Gore worked together to raise public awareness of the threat posed by global warming, and she created an office within the EPA devoted to examining adverse environmental effects on children’s health.In 2001 Browner took a job as a consultant with Madeleine Albright’s Albright Group. After the 2008 presidential election, Obama selected her to serve as the newly created “climate czar,” a post that she assumed following Obama’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009. Soon after taking office, she helped negotiate a deal with automakers to increase fuel-efficiency standards, and “cap-and-trade” legislation—which would establish a system of buying and selling pollution permits to meet greenhouse-gas emissions limits—was passed in the House of Representatives in 2009. However, the controversial measure failed to come up for a vote in the Senate, and Browner’s subsequent efforts to secure congressional passage of a comprehensive energy and climate bill were unsuccessful. In 2010 she was involved in the government’s response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In January 2011 Browner announced that she would be stepping down as coordinator of energy and climate policy. Following her departure the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy was folded into the Domestic Policy Council.

		TESTIMONY OF CAROL M. BROWNER
		April 29, 1999 







TESTIMONY OF
				CAROL M. BROWNER
				ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
				BRFORE THE
				SUBCOMMITTEE ON VA, HUD AND 
				INDEPENDANT AGENCIES
				COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS
				U.S. SENATE

April 29, 1999

Chairman Bond, Ranking Member Mikulski, and Members of the Committee, 
				I am very pleased to be here today to present the President's 
				Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Request for the Environmental Protection 
				Agency. The President's $7.2 billion request for the EPA continues 
				this Administration's efforts to protect public health and the 
				environment and provide states and communities with new, innovative 
				funding tools to help build strong, healthy communities for the 
				21st century. 
			  At the outset, Mr. Chairman, I would like to mention something 
				we at EPA are very proud of. Sallyanne Harper, the Agency's Chief 
				Financial Officer, has been named the recipient of the Joint Financial 
				Management Improvement Program's (JFMIP) 1998 Donald L. Scantlebury 
				Memorial Award. She receives this in recognition of sustained 
				leadership and a record of accomplishments in financial management 
				at EPA. This is an extremely prestigious government-wide award 
				given by the JFMIP, to recognize senior financial management executives 
				who, through outstanding and continuous leadership in financial 
				management, have been principally responsible for significant 
				economies, efficiencies, and improvements in federal, state, or 
				local government. Sallyanne has done a great job for us at EPA. 
				I just wanted to share with you our pride in Sallyanne and ask 
				you to join me in congratulating her. 
			  Mr. Chairman, with the help of this Subcommittee, which has funded 
				essential environmental programs, we have made significant progress 
				in providing a safe, healthy environment for the American people. 
				During this Administration, we have also worked with Congress 
				to pass important environmental laws and to implement earlier 
				laws to carry out our common goal of stronger environmental protections. 
				To cite just a few recent examples: 
			  
.    This year, as a result of the Safe 
				  Drinking Water Amendments of 1996, we estimate that 88 percent 
				  of the American population will receive drinking water from 
				  community water systems that meet all health-based standards 
				  in effect since 1994. The Agency has had remarkable success 
				  in carrying out those Amendments, and, to date, has not missed 
				  a single deadline that Congress placed in the law. We are honoring 
				  the commitments you made in passing this legislation, and we 
				  are meeting the safe drinking water needs of the American people. 
				.    Because of the action of this Subcommittee, 
				  and particularly your support Mr. Chairman, and that of Senator 
				  Mikulski, we have made significant progress on many of the 111 
				  key action items in the Clean Water Action Plan and will soon 
				  announce a joint strategy with USDA to protect waterways from 
				  non-point source pollution from animal feeding operations. I 
				  would like to thank this Committee for its support and funding 
				  for the Clean Water Action Plan, almost all of which goes to 
				  the states. 
				.    Today, because of the Clean Water 
				  State Revolving Fund and Construction Grants programs supported 
				  by this Committee, more than 176 million Americans receive the 
				  benefit of at least secondary treatment of wastewater, keeping 
				  pollution out of our rivers, lakes and coastlines. 
				.    We are making significant progress 
				  cleaning up toxic waste sites. As of the end of 1998, 585 Superfund 
				  toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. An additional 85 construction 
				  completions will occur in 1999. In addition, 227 communities 
				  have benefitted from more than $44 million in grants to revitalize 
				  Brownfields. The Brownfields program has helped to leverage 
				  over $1 billion in private investments which have gone a long 
				  way toward revitalizing communities. 
				.    Approximately 164 million Americans 
				  are breathing cleaner air today, because of the Clean Air Act. 
				  I would like to thank this Committee for providing funding to 
				  carry out this legislation which provides crucial health protections. 
			  
Our Fiscal Year 2000 Budget, in the tradition of every previous 
				budget submitted by this Administration, is based on what the 
				President and Vice President have proved over the past six years 
				- that we don't have to choose between environmental protection 
				and economic growth. A strong economy and a healthy environment 
				and a healthy economy go hand in hand. They are inextricably linked. 
			  Today, we have some of the toughest environmental and public 
				health protections in the world, and our economy is not only strong, 
				it is soaring. In 1992, this nation had a record high $290 billion 
				deficit. This year, we expect a $79 billion budget surplus. 
				That's progress. 
			  Building on this record of success, the Clinton-Gore 2000 budget 
				request charts a new course to meet the environmental challenges 
				of the coming century. This budget recognizes that protecting 
				our environment is about more than beautiful vistas and scenic 
				rivers, and it's about more than passing new environmental and 
				public health laws. It's about protecting our health, our air, 
				our water, our land, our food, and our children. 
			  This budget reflects a new American ideal. It's about neighborhoods, 
				protecting where we live and how we live, and what we do in the 
				everyday life. It's about communities -- and how we keep them 
				healthy, strong, and prosperous. It's about improving the quality 
				of our lives. 
			  Three new landmark initiatives in this budget reflect President 
				Clinton's and Vice President Gore's commitment to America's communities. 
				These initiatives provide significant new, innovative financial 
				tools to give communities the flexibility they need to address 
				their most pressing environmental and public health needs. They 
				tap into our nation's greatest resources -- our ingenuity and 
				spirit of collaboration. They protect our most precious resource 
				first -- our children. 
			  The Better America Bonds program puts the Agency in the 
				forefront of support for the President's and Vice President's 
				initiative to build livable American communities. This new, innovative, 
				financial tool is aimed at helping communities address problems 
				associated with urban sprawl -- such as, traffic congestion, lost 
				farmland, threatened water quality, shrinking parkland and abandoned 
				industrial sites, or Brownfields. This is about flexibility. Communities 
				can decide for themselves how they will preserve their open spaces, 
				protect their water, revitalize their blighted urban areas, and 
				improve their quality of life. The Administration proposes federal 
				tax credits that will support $9.5 billion in bond authority over 
				five years for investments by state, local and tribal governments. 
				Through this initiative, the funds invested by local communities 
				to protect the environment could go farther. I urge you to give 
				local communities this flexibility to address their most urgent 
				environmental needs. 
			  The President's budget includes $200 million for a new Clean 
				Air Partnership Fund - an initiative that is part of the Administration's 
				efforts to clean the nation's air and meet the challenge of global 
				warming. The Clean Air Partnership Fund will promote innovative 
				technology demonstrations to help communities nationwide reduce 
				harmful air pollution and greenhouse gases. The Fund finances, 
				through grants, the creation of partnerships among local communities, 
				states and tribes, the private sector, and the Federal government. 
				There is no requirement to participate. These are simply grants 
				designed to finance projects that are locally managed and self-supporting 
				and that enable communities to achieve their clean air goals sooner. 
				The Fund will stimulate cost-effective pollution control strategies, 
				spur technological innovation, and leverage substantial non-federal 
				investment in improved air quality. 
			  I am very excited to discuss this next issue: children's health. 
				I am aware that this is a concern we both share. Your work on 
				children's issues, as both Governor and Senator, has done much 
				to help ensure that our children are well prepared for a lifetime 
				of achievement. Reducing children's exposure to toxins in our 
				environment, toxins that can exacerbate asthma, is a top priority 
				for the budget before you today and is a central theme in this 
				Administration's FY 2000 budget. I look forward to finding opportunities 
				for you and I to work together on this very important issue. As 
				a start, I'd like to describe the Agency's FY 2000 proposal for 
				fighting childhood asthma. 
			  The Agency will take a leadership role as part of an Administration-wide 
				effort to fight childhood asthma and address this growing 
				problem. Five million children suffer from this debilitating disease. 
				President Clinton has provided an additional $17 million, for 
				a total of $22 million, to reduce children's exposure to toxins 
				in our environment that can exacerbate asthma. This funding will 
				implement an inter-agency initiative for education, outreach, 
				and air monitoring. An additional $12 million, for a total of 
				$40 million, focuses on other chronic childhood afflictions, such 
				as cancer and developmental disorders. EPA's investment to protect 
				children from environmental threats totals $62 million. 
			  In addition to these three new initiatives, the President's budget 
				also continues our work on the nation's other environmental and 
				public health priorities. 
			  Last year, the President announced a national blueprint to restore 
				and protect our nation's rivers, lakes, and coastal waters -- 
				and we made great progress. The President's budget allocates $651 
				million for the Clean Water Action Plan, and related activities, 
				to continue our efforts to restore and protect watersheds across 
				the country. 
			  Because polluted runoff is one of the most serious problems facing 
				communities, the President proposes another important flexible 
				funding mechanism -- this one designed to help communities provide 
				clean water. The President's proposal will allow states greater 
				flexibility to address their most pressing water quality problems: 
				polluted runoff from city streets, suburban lawns and rural areas. 
				The proposal will give states for the first time the option to 
				set aside up to 20 percent (or as much as $160 million) of their 
				FY 2000 Clean Water State Revolving Fund allotment for grants 
				to implement non-point source pollution and estuary management 
				projects. We will need the authority to allow states to set aside 
				these funds for this state-managed grant program. I look forward 
				to working with Congress to provide this authority so that we 
				can implement this important, new funding mechanism. 
			  In addition, the President's budget provides a combined $1.625 
				billion for the state revolving funds (SRF), of which $800 million 
				funds the Clean Water SRF and $825 million funds the Drinking 
				Water SRF. The Drinking Water SRF increases from last year, and 
				will help achieve the Administration's goal of capitalizing the 
				Drinking Water SRF until states can provide an average of $500 
				million in annual financial assistance for drinking water projects. 
			  The Clean Water SRF request is part of the Administration's overall 
				capitalization plan to ensure states can provide an average of 
				$2 billion a year in financial assistance for water quality projects. 
				We plan to continue capitalization of the Clean Water SRF until 
				this goal is met. I would like to note that almost $16 billion 
				in Federal capitalization grants have been provided so far to 
				the Clean Water SRF, or almost 90% more than originally authorized. 
			  The President's budget invests approximately $216 million at 
				EPA, and $1.8 billion government-wide, to help reduce the pollution 
				that causes global warming. This program will continue the Administration's 
				efforts to address the challenge of climate change through innovative, 
				cost-effective partnerships with businesses, schools, states and 
				local governments that voluntarily lower energy use -- and energy 
				bills, for everyone. The Climate Change Technology Initiative 
				proposed by the President this year also offers tax credits for 
				consumers who purchase fuel efficient cars, homes, appliances 
				and other energy-efficient products. It also includes increased 
				spending on research to develop new, cleaner technologies in areas 
				like the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and the 
				Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing. 
			  The President's budget invests $1.5 billion in Superfund to continue 
				cleanup of toxic waste sites. The Agency plans to complete clean 
				up construction at 85 sites for a total of 755 construction completions 
				by the end of 2000, with a target of 925 through 2002. The Budget 
				also invests approximately $92 million in the clean up and redevelopment 
				of abandoned industrial sites through our Brownfields Program, 
				including $35 million for the Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund 
				which helps communities leverage funds for actual cleanup of Brownfield 
				sites. Through 2000, the Agency will have funded Brownfields site 
				assessment pilots in 350 communities across our great nation. 
			  Of special importance in this budget proposal is our request 
				to increase the Agency's Operating Programs by five percent over 
				the FY 1999 Enacted level. This budget provides $3.7 billion for 
				the Operating Programs, which include most of the Agency's research, 
				regulatory and enforcement programs and funds our partnership 
				programs with states, tribes, and local governments. The Operating 
				Programs, which have grown 33 percent during this Administration, 
				represent the backbone of the nation's efforts to protect public 
				health and the environment through sound science, standard setting, 
				and enforcement. It is through these programs that the Agency 
				works to ensure that our water is pure, our air is clean and our 
				food is safe. I cannot emphasize enough the important contribution 
				the Operating Programs make to the Agency's ability to meet the 
				expectations of the American public for a safe, healthy environment. 
			  As part of these important Operating Programs, the President 
				requests $19 million for the Chemical Right-To-Know Program. This 
				includes $14.4 million for the Chemical Right-to-Know Initiative 
				to focus on accelerating the screening and testing of the 2,800 
				highest production volume chemicals used in the U.S. We will conduct 
				this initiative through a voluntary industry challenge program 
				and a series of test rules for those data not obtained through 
				the voluntary program. Information on these chemicals, many that 
				we use daily in virtually every aspect of our lives, will be broadly 
				disseminated to the public. The President's budget also provides 
				$18 million for Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and 
				Community Tracking (EMPACT) to provide citizens with access to 
				real-time information about the health of the air, land and water 
				in their communities. 
			  The President's budget supports sound science with $681 million 
				for developing and applying the best available science for addressing 
				current and future environmental hazards, as well as new approaches 
				toward improving environmental protection. The Agency will focus 
				its research efforts on areas such as Particulate Matter, Global 
				Change, Mercury and the Coastal Research Initiative. 
			  The Air Toxics program increases by almost $18 million in new 
				funding, for a total of approximately $109 million. This program 
				will focus on urban air toxics to develop tools and data that 
				will move the air toxics program from an almost exclusively technology-based 
				program to a risk-based program. The program is geared to reduce 
				risks for poor and minority groups, who are more prevalent in 
				urban areas, and will increase protection to a larger number of 
				more sensitive populations, such as children and the elderly. 
			  The budget request for the Mexican Border is $100 million, a 
				$50 million increase, for projects there. The Agency will use 
				these resources for direct grant assistance intended to address 
				the environmental and public health problems associated with untreated 
				industrial and municipal sewage on the border. 
			  These are the highlights of our Fiscal Year 2000 Request. Mr. 
				Chairman, I appreciate that this Subcommittee balances different 
				priorities which are all important to our nation, and that you 
				do so with the responsibility of stewardship over the taxpayers' 
				dollars. I look forward to discussing with you, as the year progresses, 
				the initiatives and innovative financing mechanisms in our budget 
				request. I believe they embody a common-sense, cost-effective 
				approach to environmental protection. I would be happy to answer 
				your questions at this time.

Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.
Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.
She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.
Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the decade of the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the "Energy Czar" or "Climate Czar". Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Miami, Florida,[2] Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively.[3] She has two younger sisters.[3] Browner grew up in South Miami,[3] and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house[4] – gave her a close connection to the natural world:[3][5] "I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there."[6]
Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English.[5][7] She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.[8][9]
Early career[edit]
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations.[4] There she helped revise Florida's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program.[10] In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.[4][7]
Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action,[3] in 1983.[11] They married in 1987[11] and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland.[12] They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.[3][7]
Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida.[2] In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve[4][10] as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys.[13] During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[13] She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.[4]
From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore,[2] and became known as a Gore protégé.[14][15] She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act[13] and managed Gore's legislative staff.[10]
Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida[edit]
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation,[3] Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993,[2] while living in Tallahassee.[10] It was the nation's third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million.[14] There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other.[3] She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government.[3] She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.[3]
Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known.[14] She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby.[13] She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost.[3] The head of Florida's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: "She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who's left. She really doesn't like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does."[16]
EPA Administrator[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore.[17] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992.[14] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign,[18] the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" – was seen as an indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset.[16] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named.[19] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.[20] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore.[21] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.[22]
She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action.[12] Her long-term goal was "to leave the world a slightly better place," and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home.[11] She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny.[11] She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.[11]
First four years[edit]




Carol Browner as EPA Administrator


At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget.[11] Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money.[21] Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.[18] The EPA's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.[23]
Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues[11] and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods.[21] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however.[21] A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.[24][25] Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.[11]
When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act[26][27] and to roll back other environmental regulations.[28] She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act.[29] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency.[30] Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: "an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right."[30]




Carol Browner, c. 1996


Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner's tenure were part of its "reinventing government" program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation.[31] Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities,[31] while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis.[32] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned.[31] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.[31][32]
In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups.[33][34] Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.[35]
As EPA administrator, Browner started the agency's successful Brownfields Program in 1995.[36] The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development.[36] It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.[29]
Second four years[edit]
Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph[15] came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot.[37][38] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade.[39] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits[37] and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter.[30][40] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent.[28] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate,[30] and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration.[41] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination.[40] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor.[28][37][40][41] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura"[30] and Time magazine labelled Browner the "Queen of Clean Air".[40] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns,[28] Browner said: "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."[37]




FEMA head James Lee Witt and Administrator Browner worked with a HazMat team in Kinston, North Carolina during September 1999, in the wake of severe flooding from Hurricane Floyd.


The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D'Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them.[39][40] The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court,[38] whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. largely upheld Browner's and the EPA's actions.[42] Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.[43][44]
During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority.[15] Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.[24]
During Browner's tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of "good old boys" who dominated the agency's middle management.[45] The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000.[45][46] Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up.[45] In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter,[47] Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted.[45] Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.[46]
In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances.[48] In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner's files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt.[48] Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.[48]
During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.[15][24][49] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations.[49] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency[50][51] – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years.[52] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," and wrote that she was "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues."[53] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.[19]
Business career[edit]
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a "global strategy group" headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[54] As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance.[15] She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company.[2][54] During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.[55]
Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey.[1] The marriage, his second, her third,[1] took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York.[54] Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry.[5] In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.[56]




Browner testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in April 2007


Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003;[57] her term expired in 2008.[58] She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006.[54] In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets[9] including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard.[59] She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress[60] as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters.[9] She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration.[61] Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society,[61][62][63] although the commission's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.[64]
Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal.[65] She also reported $450,000 in "member distribution" income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.[65]
Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as "the worst environmental administration ever."[8] She also stated that global warming is "the greatest challenge ever faced".[15] In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination.[8] After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.[8]
Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy[edit]




Browner spoke after President-elect Barack Obama announced her appointment as an advisor on December 15, 2008. Vice President-elect Joe Biden looks on.


On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.[66]
On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.[67] Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy,[55][68] she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government.[50] Her position was sometimes informally described as the "Energy Czar" or the "Climate Czar".[5][49][69] It did not require Senate confirmation.[61] Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress,[63] but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it.[61] In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation."[49] Browner's deputy assistant was Heather Zichal,[70] a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.[71]
The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members.[49] She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009,[68][72] and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers.[73] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[74][75] She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu,[49][72] and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall.[76] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.[77] By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies.[72] She also became a brief target of fervent anti-"czar" radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.[69]




Browner briefed President Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on the BP oil spill on June 1, 2010.


In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.[78] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional "slicing and dicing" that would separate energy and climate concerns.[79] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, "Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation."[80]
In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[77][81] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" and said that the administration was "prepared for the worst".[82] She added that "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished."[83] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that "[Browner's] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe."[84]
With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner's and the administration's goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much.[75][77][84] As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff.[77][85][86] But that did not come to pass.[85]
Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future.[84] Browner said of her unexpected decision, "[there's] no back story – it was just time to go" and that she felt "honored to have a second ... chance to serve."[77] League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a "tenacious advocate on our issues" who would be "sorely missed", while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner's exit was a good development and that "Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States."[77] Browner left the White House during March 2011.[87] Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.[87]
In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether.[88] While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama's "czars", Browner was a particular focus of it.[89] Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, "Let her leave, and take the funding, too."[88] In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other "czar" roles, most of which were similarly vacant).[90][91] Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.[92]
Return to business and advocacy[edit]
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization's Executive Committee.[60][93] She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact.[94][95] She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was "disappointed" by the Obama administration's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.[95]
In July 2013, Browner was named to the Board of Directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company.[96] In November 2013, she was named to the Advisory Board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry.[97] In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity,[98] which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters.[99]
In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change.[100][101] In that role, she has said that "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table."[101] She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" and it would simply be "irresponsible" not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.[102]
Awards and honors[edit]
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother's Day Committee "for her dedication to providing 'children with a safer, healthier world.'"[5][103] Browner also has received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association's Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society's Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association.[7][29] In 1998 she received Vice President Gore's Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better.[104] In 2000, she received the American Lung Association's President's Award for leadership towards "the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution."[29]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
