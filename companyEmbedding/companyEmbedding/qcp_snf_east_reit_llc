	Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.





	 




	On October 17, 2016, certain subsidiaries of Quality Care Properties, Inc. (QCP), a wholly owned subsidiary of HCP, Inc. (HCP), issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior secured notes due 2023 (the Notes) in connection with HCPs previously announced spin-off (the Spin-Off) of QCP, which is more fully described in the QCPs information statement, dated October 14, 2016, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to QCPs Current Report on Form 8-K, dated October 14, 2016.




	 




	The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of October 17, 2016 (the Indenture), among the subsidiary issuers party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and notes collateral agent.




	 




	The Notes will mature on November 1, 2023. The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes have been deposited into an escrow account until released in connection with the consummation of the Spin-Off or, if the Spin-Off is not consummated prior to December 15, 2016, the proceeds will be used to redeem the Notes at 100% of the gross proceeds of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.




	 




	The Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.125% per annum, payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2017.




	 




	The Notes will be secured on a second lien basis by the same collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities to be entered into in connection with the Spin-Off and will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis, by QCP and QCPs wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries, unrestricted subsidiaries to be designated by QCP and certain other customarily excluded subsidiaries, that are borrowers or guarantors under the senior secured credit facilities (the Guarantors). Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Spin-Off, the Guarantors will execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture joining them thereto as guarantors.




	 




	On or after November 1, 2019, QCP may redeem the Notes at QCPs option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. QCP may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on or prior to November 1, 2019 in an amount equal to the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture. Prior to November 1, 2019, QCP may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus the applicable make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture. There is no sinking fund for the Notes.




	 




	Upon certain events constituting a change of control under the Indenture, the noteholders will have the right to require us to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including, the date of purchase.




	 




	The Indenture includes covenants customary for high yield senior notes of this type, including covenants relating to QCPs ability to sell assets, pay dividends and make other distributions, redeem or repurchase QCPs capital stock, incur additional debt and issue capital stock, create liens, consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of QCPs assets, enter into certain transactions with QCPs affiliates, make loans, investments or advances, or repay subordinated indebtedness. The Indenture also requires that QCP maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00, which will be tested on a quarterly basis.




	 




	The Indenture provides for customary events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become, or to be declared, due and payable. Events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), include, among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of other covenants or agreements in the Indenture, failure to pay certain other indebtedness, failure to pay certain final judgments, failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.




	 












	 




	The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Indenture filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.




	 









	Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.





	 




	The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.
