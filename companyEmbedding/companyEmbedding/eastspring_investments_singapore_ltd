IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Investment involves risk. The offering document should be read for further details including the risk factors. Past performance information presented is not indicative of future performance.
This website contains information about investment funds which invest in equities and/or bonds, each with different risk profiles. The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Prices of equities and bonds may fluctuate and you may not get back your original investment.
Some funds may invest in emerging markets, single countries or industry sectors. The investment focus of such funds might give rise to increased risk over more diversified funds.
Some funds may have significant exposure to financial derivatives instruments, which involve risks different from and possibly greater than, the risks presented by traditional investments. Risks associated with derivatives are market risk, management risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and leverage risk. The funds will also be exposed to credit risk of the counterparties with which it trades. In adverse market situations, the fund’s use of derivatives may become ineffective and the fund may suffer significant losses.
Some of the funds may be exposed to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Risks associated with these securities include liquidity, market, credit risk and interest rates risks.
The value of the funds can be volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time.
The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells the fund to you has advised you that the fund is suitable for you and has explained why, including how the fund would be consistent with your investment objectives, risk profile and unique situation.
You should not make any investment decision solely based on the information on this website.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Investment involves risk. The offering document should be read for further details including the risk factors. Past performance information presented is not indicative of future performance.
This website contains information about investment funds which invest in equities and/or bonds, each with different risk profiles. The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Prices of equities and bonds may fluctuate and you may not get back your original investment.
Some funds may invest in emerging markets, single countries or industry sectors. The investment focus of such funds might give rise to increased risk over more diversified funds.
Some funds may have significant exposure to financial derivatives instruments, which involve risks different from and possibly greater than, the risks presented by traditional investments. Risks associated with derivatives are market risk, management risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and leverage risk. The funds will also be exposed to credit risk of the counterparties with which it trades. In adverse market situations, the fund’s use of derivatives may become ineffective and the fund may suffer significant losses.
Some of the funds may be exposed to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Risks associated with these securities include liquidity, market, credit risk and interest rates risks.
The value of the funds can be volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time.
The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells the fund to you has advised you that the fund is suitable for you and has explained why, including how the fund would be consistent with your investment objectives, risk profile and unique situation.
You should not make any investment decision solely based on the information on this website.

Distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Past distributions are not necessarily indicative of future trends, which may be lower. Distribution payouts and its frequency are determined by the Board of Directors/Eastspring Investments (Singapore) Limited, and can be made out of (a) income; or (b) net capital gains; or (c) capital of the Fund or a combination of any of (a) and/or (b) and/or (c). The payment of distributions should not be confused with the Fund’s performance, rate of return or yield. Any payment of distributions by the Fund may result in an immediate decrease in the net asset value per share/unit. 
Funds with Monthly and Quarterly Distribution Frequency: Annual Dividend Yield = (Dividend amount / Reference NAV) x (No. of calendar days in a year / No. of calendar days in distribution period) x 100%. Funds with Yearly Distribution Frequency: Annual Dividend Yield = (Dividend amount / Total Net Assets) x (No. of calendar days in a year / No. of calendar days in distribution period) x 100%.

The value of the funds can be volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time.
The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells the fund to you has advised you that the fund is suitable for you and has explained why, including how the fund would be consistent with your investment objectives, risk profile and unique situation.
You should not make any investment decision solely based on the information on this website.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Investment involves risk. The offering document should be read for further details including the risk factors. Past performance information presented is not indicative of future performance.
This website contains information about investment funds which invest in equities and/or bonds, each with different risk profiles. The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Prices of equities and bonds may fluctuate and you may not get back your original investment.
Some funds may invest in emerging markets, single countries or industry sectors. The investment focus of such funds might give rise to increased risk over more diversified funds.
Some funds may have significant exposure to financial derivatives instruments, which involve risks different from and possibly greater than, the risks presented by traditional investments. Risks associated with derivatives are market risk, management risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and leverage risk. The funds will also be exposed to credit risk of the counterparties with which it trades. In adverse market situations, the fund’s use of derivatives may become ineffective and the fund may suffer significant losses.
Some of the funds may be exposed to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Risks associated with these securities include liquidity, market, credit risk and interest rates risks.
The value of the funds can be volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time.
The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells the fund to you has advised you that the fund is suitable for you and has explained why, including how the fund would be consistent with your investment objectives, risk profile and unique situation.
You should not make any investment decision solely based on the information on this website.


Please note that if you do not agree to the above information and the Disclaimer, Copyright and Other Important Notice and  Privacy Policy, you must leave this website immediately and stop all further access to its contents.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Investment involves risk. The offering document should be read for further details including the risk factors. Past performance information presented is not indicative of future performance.
This website contains information about investment funds which invest in equities and/or bonds, each with different risk profiles. The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Prices of equities and bonds may fluctuate and you may not get back your original investment.
Some funds may invest in emerging markets, single countries or industry sectors. The investment focus of such funds might give rise to increased risk over more diversified funds.
Some funds may have significant exposure to financial derivatives instruments, which involve risks different from and possibly greater than, the risks presented by traditional investments. Risks associated with derivatives are market risk, management risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and leverage risk. The funds will also be exposed to credit risk of the counterparties with which it trades. In adverse market situations, the fund’s use of derivatives may become ineffective and the fund may suffer significant losses.
Some of the funds may be exposed to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Risks associated with these securities include liquidity, market, credit risk and interest rates risks.
The value of the funds can be volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time.
The investment decision is yours but you should not invest unless the intermediary who sells the fund to you has advised you that the fund is suitable for you and has explained why, including how the fund would be consistent with your investment objectives, risk profile and unique situation.
You should not make any investment decision solely based on the information on this website.
