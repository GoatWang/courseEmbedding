How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

They may be good stories or bad, and they may be true or untrue, but these stories shape our perspectives on wealth, status and self-worth.

Investing Basics










Compound Interest
Investing doesn’t require great wealth or complicated strategies. You just need to put today’s dollars – even small amounts – where time and compounding interest can help them grow.







Investing Affordably
For some things you buy, if you pay more, you get more. But paying more for a mutual fund may mean you get less. Here's why.







Managing Volatility
Financial market volatility – real or anticipated – is often accompanied by a strong emotional reaction. The simple reason: you’re human.











Homestead Funds was created in 1990 to give National Rural Electric Cooperative Association members a convenient way to obtain professional and affordable money management. The funds are also open to investors outside of the cooperative community.

You could lose money by investing in the Daily Income Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
The total returns shown above represent past performance which does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. For performance data current to the most recent month-end, call 800.258.3030 or visit homesteadfunds.com.
Total returns include interest, capital gains, dividends and distributions.
Investments in fixed-income funds are subject to interest rate, credit and inflation risk. Interest rate risk is risk that a change in rates will negatively affect the value of the securities in the Fund’s portfolio. Equity funds, in general, are subject to style risk, the chance that returns on stocks within the style category in which the fund invests will trail returns of stocks representing other styles or the market overall. Share prices of small-capitalization stock funds may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization stock funds. Smaller companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or their management teams may have less depth and expertise compared with large-capitalization companies. International investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and political instability. Index funds are subject to tracking risk, the risk that the fund’s return will not closely track the return of the index. The Growth Fund is classified as “non-diversified,” which means that the proportion of the Fund’s assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer is not limited, making the Fund more susceptible to volatility stemming from one-time events and to the financial conditions of the issuers in which it invests than a diversified fund.
The BofA Merrill Lynch 1 – 5 Year U.S. Treasury Index measures the performance of short-term U.S. Treasury securities. The BofA Merrill Lynch 1 – 5 Year Govt/Corp. Index measures the performance of U.S. government and investment-grade corporate debt. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index is a broad-based measure of U.S. stock market performance and includes 500 widely held common stocks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value sector in the US equity market. It is a subset of the S&P 500 Index and consists of those stocks in the S&P 500 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics. The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 Index is a subset of the Russell 3000 Index representing approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of that Index. It includes approximately 2000 of the smallest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The MSCI EAFE Index is an equity index which captures large and mid-cap representation across developed markets countries around the world, excluding the US and Canada. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
