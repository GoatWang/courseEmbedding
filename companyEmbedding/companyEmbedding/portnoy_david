Portnoy's Complaint is a 1969 American novel that turned its author Philip Roth into a major celebrity, sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver.[2] The novel tells the humorous monologue of "a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor," who confesses to his psychoanalyst in "intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language."[3][4] Many of its characteristics (comedic prose; themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration; a self-conscious literariness) went on to become Roth trademarks.[citation needed]
In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Portnoy's Complaint 52nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time included this novel in its "TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005."[5]

Structure and themes[edit]
Structurally, Portnoy's Complaint is a continuous monologue as narrated by its speaker, Alexander Portnoy, to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by "the permissive conventions of the patient-analyst situation," which would "permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language that [...] in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene."[3][4]
Portnoy is "a lust-ridden, mother addicted young Jewish bachelor,"[3] and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of eroticism;[citation needed] also, much of his dilemma is that "his sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so fixed."[3] Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book. On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical definition of "Portnoy's Complaint", as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction:

Portnoy's Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature...

The title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint, such as The Lover's Complaint, which typically presents the speaker's comments on being a spurned lover.
Other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of Israel, and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a Jewish family.
Portnoy's Complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was published. Most obviously, the book's sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full swing during the late 1960s. And the book's narrative style, a huge departure from the stately, semi-Jamesian prose of Roth's earlier novels, has often been likened to the stand-up performances of 1960s comedian Lenny Bruce.
The novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver[2] which Portnoy's mother later serves for dinner.[6]
Writing[edit]
Roth had begun work on Portnoy's Complaint in 1967, before publication of his novel When She Was Good that year. The piece had its genesis in a satirical monologue Roth had written to accompany a slide show proposed for inclusion in the risqué revue Oh! Calcutta! that would focus on the sexual organs of the rich and famous. While the slide show would never come to fruition, Roth found part of the accompanying monologue about masturbation salvageable. Roth re-fashioned the material for the novel and sold a chapter of the book, entitled "Whacking Off", to Partisan Review. Progress on the novel was slow because Roth was suffering from writer's block relating to his ex-wife, Margaret Martinson, and the unpleasant notion that any royalties generated by the novel would have to be split equally with her. In May 1968 Martinson was killed in a car crash in Central Park. Roth's writer's block lifted and following Martinson's funeral he traveled to the Yaddo literary retreat to complete the manuscript.[7]
Responses, reviews and attacks[edit]
The publication of the novel caused a major controversy in American public discourse. The two aspects that evoked such outrage were its explicit and candid treatment about sexuality and obscenities, including detailed depiction of masturbation, which was revolutionary in the late 1960s; and the irreverent portrait of Jewish identity.[4] It sparked an uproar in the Jewish community, even among New York intellectuals such as Irving Howe and Diana Trilling.[4]
Censorship[edit]
In 1969 the book was declared a "prohibited import" in Australia, though the Australian publisher, Penguin Books, resisted and had copies printed in secret and stored in fleets of moving trucks. Several attempts to prosecute Penguin and any bookseller carrying the book failed.[8]
Many libraries in the United States banned the book because of its detailed discussion of masturbation and its explicit language.[4]
Allusions to the title[edit]
The popularity of the novel has caused the title to become a sort of shorthand for any form of sexual malaise or activity. In his autobiography, Dick Cavett wrote that on one occasion when a male guest was unable to appear on his talk show, Cavett jokingly told the studio audience the guest could not attend because he was "suffering from Portnoy's Complaint", a comment which the network censors decided to cut from the broadcast tape. Gore Vidal once quipped to Claire Bloom, Roth's second wife: "You have already had Portnoy's complaint [her previous husband]. Do not involve yourself with Portnoy."
On the September 8, 2010, episode of The Daily Show, as part of an extended segment on the amount of violence in major religious texts, Jon Stewart and John Oliver have a debate wherein Stewart claims the book as the main text of Judaism, in response to Oliver's demand of disavowal regarding the violence depicted in portions of Hebrew sacred texts.
In her metafictional novel Culture Shock (Duckworth 1988), Valerie Grosvenor Myer wrote of a satirically presented married couple among her characters: "Let us consider my Jean and Jack ... I weighted the scales by presenting them in the rôle of parents ... fictional parents are usually set up as Aunt Sallies to be knocked down ... Mrs Bennet, Mrs Nickleby, Mrs Portnoy; Old Capulet, Mr Dorrit, Dr Sloper."
In the Get Smart original TV series, in the fifth-season episode "Do I Hear a Vaults?", aired on May 8, 1970, Maxwell Smart alludes to the book being hidden in a public library.
The Mad Men character, Don Draper, is briefly shown reading the novel in the season seven episode of the series titled, "The Monolith."
On the TV series Californication, in the episode titled "Coke Dick and the First Kick", a female writer for Rolling Stone magazine calls one of Hank Moody's early novels "the retarded man's Portnoy's Complaint", which he admits made him want to "muff punch her" with his typewriter.
In the Family Guy episode "Peter, Chris, & Brian", Brian Griffin makes several references to Portnoy's Complaint, clearly not having read the book and assuming it was about a "port noise complaint".
Adaptations[edit]
The novel was adapted into a movie starring Richard Benjamin and Karen Black

Portnoy's Complaint is a 1969 American novel that turned its author Philip Roth into a major celebrity, sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver.[2] The novel tells the humorous monologue of "a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor," who confesses to his psychoanalyst in "intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language."[3][4] Many of its characteristics (comedic prose; themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration; a self-conscious literariness) went on to become Roth trademarks.[citation needed]
In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Portnoy's Complaint 52nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time included this novel in its "TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005."[5]

Structure and themes[edit]
Structurally, Portnoy's Complaint is a continuous monologue as narrated by its speaker, Alexander Portnoy, to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by "the permissive conventions of the patient-analyst situation," which would "permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language that [...] in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene."[3][4]
Portnoy is "a lust-ridden, mother addicted young Jewish bachelor,"[3] and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of eroticism;[citation needed] also, much of his dilemma is that "his sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so fixed."[3] Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book. On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical definition of "Portnoy's Complaint", as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction:

Portnoy's Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature...

The title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint, such as The Lover's Complaint, which typically presents the speaker's comments on being a spurned lover.
Other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of Israel, and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a Jewish family.
Portnoy's Complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was published. Most obviously, the book's sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full swing during the late 1960s. And the book's narrative style, a huge departure from the stately, semi-Jamesian prose of Roth's earlier novels, has often been likened to the stand-up performances of 1960s comedian Lenny Bruce.

On the TV series Californication, in the episode titled "Coke Dick and the First Kick", a female writer for Rolling Stone magazine calls one of Hank Moody's early novels "the retarded man's Portnoy's Complaint", which he admits made him want to "muff punch her" with his typewriter.
In the Family Guy episode "Peter, Chris, & Brian", Brian Griffin makes several references to Portnoy's Complaint, clearly not having read the book and assuming it was about a "port noise complaint".
Adaptations[edit]
The novel was adapted into a movie starring Richard Benjamin and Karen Black

Portnoy's Complaint is a 1969 American novel that turned its author Philip Roth into a major celebrity, sparking a storm of controversy over its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver.[2] The novel tells the humorous monologue of "a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor," who confesses to his psychoanalyst in "intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language."[3][4] Many of its characteristics (comedic prose; themes of sexual desire and sexual frustration; a self-conscious literariness) went on to become Roth trademarks.[citation needed]
In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Portnoy's Complaint 52nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time included this novel in its "TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005."[5]

Structure and themes[edit]
Structurally, Portnoy's Complaint is a continuous monologue as narrated by its speaker, Alexander Portnoy, to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by "the permissive conventions of the patient-analyst situation," which would "permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language that [...] in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene."[3][4]
Portnoy is "a lust-ridden, mother addicted young Jewish bachelor,"[3] and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of eroticism;[citation needed] also, much of his dilemma is that "his sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so fixed."[3] Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book. On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical definition of "Portnoy's Complaint", as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction:

Portnoy's Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature...

The title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint, such as The Lover's Complaint, which typically presents the speaker's comments on being a spurned lover.
Other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of Israel, and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a Jewish family.
Portnoy's Complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was published. Most obviously, the book's sexual frankness was both a product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full swing during the late 1960s. And the book's narrative style, a huge departure from the stately, semi-Jamesian prose of Roth's earlier novels, has often been likened to the stand-up performances of 1960s comedian Lenny Bruce.
The novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various props including a piece of liver[2] which Portnoy's mother later serves for dinner.[6]
Writing[edit]
Roth had begun work on Portnoy's Complaint in 1967, before publication of his novel When She Was Good that year. The piece had its genesis in a satirical monologue Roth had written to accompany a slide show proposed for inclusion in the risqué revue Oh! Calcutta! that would focus on the sexual organs of the rich and famous. While the slide show would never come to fruition, Roth found part of the accompanying monologue about masturbation salvageable. Roth re-fashioned the material for the novel and sold a chapter of the book, entitled "Whacking Off", to Partisan Review. Progress on the novel was slow because Roth was suffering from writer's block relating to his ex-wife, Margaret Martinson, and the unpleasant notion that any royalties generated by the novel would have to be split equally with her. In May 1968 Martinson was killed in a car crash in Central Park. Roth's writer's block lifted and following Martinson's funeral he traveled to the Yaddo literary retreat to complete the manuscript.[7]
Responses, reviews and attacks[edit]
The publication of the novel caused a major controversy in American public discourse. The two aspects that evoked such outrage were its explicit and candid treatment about sexuality and obscenities, including detailed depiction of masturbation, which was revolutionary in the late 1960s; and the irreverent portrait of Jewish identity.[4] It sparked an uproar in the Jewish community, even among New York intellectuals such as Irving Howe and Diana Trilling.[4]
Censorship[edit]
In 1969 the book was declared a "prohibited import" in Australia, though the Australian publisher, Penguin Books, resisted and had copies printed in secret and stored in fleets of moving trucks. Several attempts to prosecute Penguin and any bookseller carrying the book failed.[8]
Many libraries in the United States banned the book because of its detailed discussion of masturbation and its explicit language.[4]
Allusions to the title[edit]
The popularity of the novel has caused the title to become a sort of shorthand for any form of sexual malaise or activity. In his autobiography, Dick Cavett wrote that on one occasion when a male guest was unable to appear on his talk show, Cavett jokingly told the studio audience the guest could not attend because he was "suffering from Portnoy's Complaint", a comment which the network censors decided to cut from the broadcast tape. Gore Vidal once quipped to Claire Bloom, Roth's second wife: "You have already had Portnoy's complaint [her previous husband]. Do not involve yourself with Portnoy."
On the September 8, 2010, episode of The Daily Show, as part of an extended segment on the amount of violence in major religious texts, Jon Stewart and John Oliver have a debate wherein Stewart claims the book as the main text of Judaism, in response to Oliver's demand of disavowal regarding the violence depicted in portions of Hebrew sacred texts.
In her metafictional novel Culture Shock (Duckworth 1988), Valerie Grosvenor Myer wrote of a satirically presented married couple among her characters: "Let us consider my Jean and Jack ... I weighted the scales by presenting them in the rôle of parents ... fictional parents are usually set up as Aunt Sallies to be knocked down ... Mrs Bennet, Mrs Nickleby, Mrs Portnoy; Old Capulet, Mr Dorrit, Dr Sloper."
In the Get Smart original TV series, in the fifth-season episode "Do I Hear a Vaults?", aired on May 8, 1970, Maxwell Smart alludes to the book being hidden in a public library.
The Mad Men character, Don Draper, is briefly shown reading the novel in the season seven episode of the series titled, "The Monolith."
On the TV series Californication, in the episode titled "Coke Dick and the First Kick", a female writer for Rolling Stone magazine calls one of Hank Moody's early novels "the retarded man's Portnoy's Complaint", which he admits made him want to "muff punch her" with his typewriter.
In the Family Guy episode "Peter, Chris, & Brian", Brian Griffin makes several references to Portnoy's Complaint, clearly not having read the book and assuming it was about a "port noise complaint".

5.0 out of 5 starsA gripping classic that will always be relevantByMichael W Connorson April 21, 2016Time has not damaged this tome; it remains a sometimes harrowing, sometimes absorbing, sometimes frustrating, sometimes moving look into a mind in a state of disarray.Others have written more "shocking" books or have been more overtly anti-social, but with Sharks Have Feelings Too, David Portnoy captures the bitterly confused mind of a shark who hates the whole world not because the world is worth hating, but because he's frustrated at his own inability to get along in that world, with such crisp reality that it shocks far more than any fantastical American Psycho.Reading over the one negative review on Amazon, I can't help but wonder how and why this person does not get it. Sharks Have Feelings Too is among the, if not the, most tangibly realistic looks into the mind of a disaffected, disillusioned shark suffering from depression (and a touch of the bipolar). The way the shark's mind works is incredibly true to form - the contradictions, the hypocrisy, the confusion, the brief moments of sheer clarity followed by stretches of irrational thought. He thinks he's better than the world, and he thinks he's the lousiest shark in the world at the same time. He wants everyone to go away and leave him alone, and he can't bear anyone, not even some schmuck he really dislikes (with good reason), to leave him. He's nothing but hypocrisy and contradictions and confusion. Portnoy captures this in an amazing way.People criticize the book because the shark is totally unlikable, a guy who rails against phonies when he himself is something of a phony ... but that's part of the point. The shark throws off all the signals someone in his situation actually throws off in real life, and just like real life, they're almost always ignored. Clearly this was a very, very autobiographical work for Portnoy.There are several moments when the shark, narrating in the first person, mentions offhandedly that he began to cry, he didn't know why, he felt like dying, and suddenly it went away and he felt invigorated with energy. It rings remarkably true. Who wrote this stuff with such honesty in 2016? Who tackled these issues, and in such a manner, in the 2010s?The reason this has impact, though, is not simply because of the subject matter, not because of what the shark is going through, and not because of the context of its time, but because Portnoy never plays it for melodrama. He doesn't talk it up with purple prose or romanticize the shark's mentality or beat you over the head with ham-handed messages and platitudes. He neither makes the shark's mentality seem "cool" nor does he preach against his attitude; he just says, "This is what it is." By presenting it in such a matter-of-fact manner, all in the first person, as if the narrator is simply telling you a story while having a few drinks, the whole thing is rooted in a very tangible, and therefore very disturbing, reality.You and I KNOW the shark. We've known that guy. And in Sharks Have Feelings Too, you get to peer inside his mind.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsBravo! Bravo!ByGarboon April 21, 2016Verified Purchase'Sharks Have Feelings Too' is more than just a transcendent piece of investigative journalism–and it is more than a masterfully crafted work of Joycean prose. SHFT rips away the veil of bigotry and hatred to expose the house of horrors that sharks traverse in noble silence. Majestic defenders of reef and shoal persecuted for their strength. At the book's crescendo, I gasped as revelation washed over me, sudden and violent, and I knew that I was changed forever. It took from me my innocence and naiveté, but it left me empowered in its wake. SHFT is more than a literary masterpiece, it is a call to arms. Thank you, David Portnoy.#GoPresGo indeed.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsShakespeare. Dostoevsky. Vonnegut. Portnoy.Bydannyon April 22, 2016Verified PurchaseThis is a timeless classic that stimulates the mind with interesting and incomplete facts about sharks.  Prepare yourself for an emotional avalanche that will have you turning the page every two seconds due to the fact that MS Paint does not lend itself to a high word count per page.  What the author lacks in ability and even effort is made up by the fact that he somehow managed to sexually objectify Kat Timpf with rudimentary computer animation from the 1990s.  In all honesty, this book will change your perception about sharks, decency as it pertains to drawings of white people in ancient asian garb, and even maybe life in general.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsRead a book for me one timeByPen Nameon April 24, 2016Verified PurchaseI'm a math guy. I can crunch numbers. I know that I have a better chance of dying while typing this review on my toilet seat from a bad batch of Chinese food that came from one of those places that throws a paper ad under your door than I do from a shark attack. Most people don't think that way, however. They let the main stream media tell them sharks are murderous psychopaths with more kills under their belts than the Zodiac killer/potential 2016 Republican Presidential candidate. So do me a favor. Do us all a favor. Read this book. Get some knowledge into your brain. Sharks aren't the problem; people are the problem. And Dave Portnoy's book is the solution. And the best part is that your $1.99 that probably would've been spent buying eggs at the gas station that has a 200% markup is now going to a shark conservation effort dedicated to stuffing shark poachers in a locker. Thanks for the great work, Dave.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsNo doubt will influence and inspire future generations of writersByAmazon Customeron April 21, 2016Verified PurchaseThe most memorable and original aspect of Sharks Have Feelings Too lies in Portony's portrait of sharks themselves. He brings to light their feelings, their emotions, their struggle and most importantly he humanizes them. This book will forever be seen as the literary masterpiece that gave rise to the pro-shark movement and the preservation of not only the ecosystem, but life itself. Thank you David.0Comment|

The guy just promises and delivers every single time. This book on sharks was the best and most educational piece of literature I have ever read.

Brilliant!!ByShaun Morseon April 20, 2016Verified PurchaseClearly outlined and identified the major issues at hand in the shark vs snake debate. David mounts a very compelling argument in favor of sharks, WITHOUT showering them with favoritism. Mr. Portnoy is an asset to the shark specialist community, I eagerly await his next publication.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsThe Godfather of NovelsByChad8182on January 31, 2017Verified PurchaseThe absolutely breathtaking tale that captured the minds of millions, this is truly the magnum opus of the literary world. Portnoy's word choice and diction are second to none, and he truly captivates the reader in the world of shark's and their various emotional enigmas. Its a sin against humanity itself not to read this book and share it with others for the enlightenment of our society.While a plethora of critics have praised this masterpiece, several critics find it hard to grasp the novel's underlying message and philosophical value on our world and the underwater dwelling place of sharks. From newspapers to radio to shows on Comedy Central, this truly is Portnoy's best work and call to action.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

He is not only a creative genius, but has a brain size we all wish to have. Nothing this man hasn't overcome and made him an even better noble leader of the Barstool world. All praise be to Pres for not only this book, but for literally sacrificing body and spirit delivering those newspapers so many years ago just so those fat and lazy and ugly sharks can live the life they are accustomed to today.0Comment|

Data.world Platform


Leave a reply 


Recently I’ve been playing around with the relatively new Data.world platform, which is intended to be the social network for data people.  I tried some of the query and visualization features, as well as uploading datasets.  Seems it has a lot of promise and I really hope it takes off.  I think at the moment, the biggest challenge for me is how to distinguish which datasets are trustworthy and clean.  I also think they have an opportunity to greatly improve the search capability for datasets if they could provide advanced search directives, such as explicitly specifying fields, geographic locations, time frames or semantic tags.
Today, I received an email from Data.world listing 10 favorite features of their users.  They’re listed below and I’m sure exploring them could provide for countless hours of fun.




10) Add metadata with data dictionaries, file tags, and column descriptions
9) Instantly query and join .csv and .json files using SQL
8) Join your local data with other datasets in data.world
7) Showcase your code, data, and documentation in Python and R notebooks
6) See inside files before downloading
5) Use integrations for R, Python, or JDBC to pull data into your tools of choice
4) Enrich your analyses with U.S. Census ACS summary files
3) Export datasets as Tabular Data Packages, a standard machine-readable format
2) Pull data directly into Tableau to create your visualizations
1) Add and sync files from GitHub, Google Drive, or S3

Python Serverless Microframework


Leave a reply 


AWS has introduced a Python serverless microframework.  It’s a beautiful concept, making it super simple to create and deploy an APIs with infinite scalability.  It does so by leveraging the Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda without the learning curve.  That said, the ideal use case for the frameworke is for rapid prototyping or highly scalable deployment of a very simple rest API.  It’s the right choice as long as the API you need is a good candidate for development using Python with Flask-like view decorators.
The framework is accessible via the Chalice GitHub repository, providing a CLI (command line tool) for creating, deploying, and managing your app.  All  you need to deploy a new API is to put your app in a Python file.  How little effort is needed to get going?  How about this…
pip install chalice
chalice new-project
chalice deploy
Now you’re ready to hit the endpoint you configured!
(Note that as a tradeoff for simplicity, not all API Gateway and Lambda services are exposed to Chalice.  There is a simple way to consume AWS Lambda’s built-in logging via Amazon CloudWatch Logs.)
 





Predictive Analytics: Why IoT is different


Leave a reply 


The challenge: Moving from batch retrospective to real-time predictive analytics
First, let’s get the lay of the land.  Batch processed analytics has a solid track record with well-defined use cases and best practices.  And most analytics today are still limited to getting retrospective answers.  Many organizations are turning to the more forward-looking predictive analytics to broaden the actions they could take beyond the confines of historical decisions and add ability to ask what-if questions.
The Internet of Things (IoT) on the other hand is still quite new, with methodologies for solving unique problems, such as those around real-time processing and connectivity limitations, still being hashed out.  Now add the desire to move from retrospective to predictive and you have a world of new challenges.  In the past few years, there have been great strides made in both technologies and methods in processing of data in real-time.  But the move to predictive often takes an even bigger leap, due to the challenge that to get more incremental insight requires an exponential increase in data ingestion and processing capacity.  As a result, predictive analytics still accounts for only a small fraction of a typical organization’s analytical capabilities.
 
IoT adds another twist: Network and processing bottlenecks
What makes IoT different when it comes to predictive analytics?   In some applications, the majority of collected data loses value within milliseconds.  Historically, data collection has been the hard part of a predictive analytics system.  However, that’s shifting, especially with advances in industrial IoT technologies.  IoT brings capabilities to scale the volume of data collection while reducing latency.  As a result, now collection is becoming the easy part.  The bottlenecks start at sanitization, modeling and integration.  This in turn makes the downstream components of analytics and taking action more challenging. 
When looking at optimizing an IoT implementation, it’s important to balance the roles and capabilities of “edge” vs. “cloud”.  Edge refers to specialized infrastructure that can improve performance through physical proximity.  It enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur closer to the source of the data.  Edge gives you responsiveness, but not scale.  Cloud, on the other hand, gives you scale but not responsiveness.  
 
Making it work: Configuring the 3 components
There are three core components in any IoT implementation.  First, collection, which includes sensing, network, storage and query capability.  Second, learning, to analyze the data and generate predictions.  And, third, taking action, typically using automated methods, on the analytics from prior stages.  In traditional cloud-centric IoT architecture, while the actual sensors are outside of the cloud, the collect, learn and act components of the system often run into responsiveness challenges.  In situations where data collection volumes are particularly large, the overhead of network communications has a significant impact on cost, sometimes up to 50% of the entire system.  
Moving any portion of these three components to the edge results in performance gains, because less data needs to be moved between each.  More buffering and storage can occur at the edge as the cost of memory and disk continues to drop.  (It should also be noted however that the storage and query functions of the system may become less prevalent as data is processed and acted on in real-time.)  Then various aspects of data filtering, computation and predictive analytics can be executed at the edge, so that only data required for centralized processing needs to be moved.  These gains need to be balanced against increasing system complexity resulting from the fact that edge resources may not be continuously connected to the network.  So clearly there are many ways to implement and fine tune predictive analytics for IoT.  Doing this will only get easier as the field matures.

For context…  The subject matter for this post came from a talk by Venu Vasudevan, Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Rice University, where we discussed what makes IoT more challenging when it comes to specifically predictive analytics.  This topic was presented at an IoT meetup for the Predix platform, a cloud-based IoT platform-as-a-service (PaaS) created by GE.  It’s open source and built on CouldFoundry’s stack.  Predix is available on AWS and Azure cloud services.  
 





Leveraging healthcare data for consumer solutions


Leave a reply 


On April 23, 2016, over 300 developers from around the country descended on San Francisco for the weekend to tackle some of the hardest challenges facing the nation.  The event was called BayesHack, sponsored by the nonprofit Bayes Impact.  There were representatives from 7 cabinet-level federal agencies present to set up the 11 “prompts”, mentor the teams and judge the entries.  The prompts for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs asked challenging questions on how to leverage existing datasets…

How can data connect individuals with the health providers they need?
How can data get help to sufferers of opioid addiction?
How can data predict and prevent veteran suicide?
How can data tackle End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)?

 
As part of the judging process, the teams had to pitch their solutions to both agencies and private sector judges, such as partners at Andreessen Horowitz.  All teams submitted their code to the event’s github account, so that it could be used for judging, as well as ensuring that it will be available in the public domain.    For hackathons such as this one, it’s important to recognize that even if there are already similar commercial products, getting solutions into the public domain makes it possible for others build on later.  (Incidentally, this focus on actual working prototypes via GitHub is surprisingly lacking from many hackathons.  Bayes did a great job focusing on potential implementation beyond just the weekend.)
Of particular focus was the “How can data connect individuals with the health providers they need?” prompt, since this data has only recently become available, due to a regulatory requirement.  This data consisted of commercial healthcare provider networks for plans on ACA insurance marketplaces, including plan coverage, practice locations, specialties, copays and drug formularies.  There were 7 team submissions, most of which produced solutions focusing on usability for consumers and advanced analytics to policy makers.  Some teams expanded the scope to include not just insurance selection, but access to care in general.
To summarize some of the novel ideas in the solutions…

Simplified mobile-first user experience, resembling TurboTax for health selection
Visualizations and what-if analysis for policy makers
Voice recognition and NLP, as in Google freeform search instead of menus and buttons
Ranking algorithms and recommendation engines
Ingesting additional 3rd party information (such as Vitals, Yelp, and Part D claims) for consumers who need additional information before they can make an informed choice
Providing an API for other apps to leverage
Enabling self-reporting of network accuracy, like GasBuddy for health plan coverage

Here are some notable entries for this prompt:



The Hhs-marketplace team created an app that leverages chart visualizations to let a consumer compare plan attributes against benchmarks, such as state averages.  The example below shows a user entering a zip code and the specialists they’re interested in seeing.  The app finds the plans that meet those criteria, displays cost comparisons for them and a graphical comparison of the options.

 


The Fhir salamander team created mobile-first responsive web front end that takes the user through a series of simple menu choices to get them to recommended plans.  Along the way, for convenience and efficiency, it enables the user to click a button to place a telephone call to the plans (to ensure that the doctor they want is taking new patients from that plan) or to view the summary plan description files.
In working on the challenge the team transcribed the JSON provider network schema into a relational model.  They reported identifying data quality issues and therefore needing to clean up the raw data in order to use it for analytics.  They also generated state-level statistics to assist in comparison.  The app is written in Javascript, while the analytics are in Python.  They feel that the relational model, code to load it and the code to clean up the data could be reused elsewhere.  While the AWS website (http://tiny.cc/bayeshhs_fsdemo) is no longer live, the deck is available (http://tiny.cc/bayeshhs_fs).



The Hhs insights team produced an interactive provider density map.  Their approach was to target policy makers, rather than consumers.  For that purpose, they built aggregate analytics and related visualizations.  For example, their code uses DOL MSA (Metro Statistical Area) for GeoJSON calculations and visualizations.  In order to enable the needed analytics, they had to take on the challenge of normalizing the JSON schema of provider networks into a tabular format, as well as pre-calculating several aggregate metrics.



The Hhs marketplace finder team created an app that displays the pros-cons of the top 5 plan option for the
user, along with visualizations for making quantitative comparisons easy to understand.  Bad choices are suppressed to avoid screen clutter.  It starts with less than 10 simple questions.  Then adds a prediction of the user’s healthcare needs, which was determined based on statistics by age, gender, preexisting conditions and location.  Finally, it would eventually make it possible for a user to estimate their total cost based on different events, such as hospitalization or illness.


A data science team from Berkeley calling themselves Semantic Search, submitted an extremely ambitious
project.  Basically, creation of a Google Pagerank for healthcare decisions.  Instead of the menus and buttons of a traditional app UI, this solution used a freeform field for a user to indicate what they were looking for.  The goal is to let a consumer who is not tech saavy explain their situation in a natural way, without the interface and technology getting in the way.  Under the covers it uses natural language processing, ranking algorithms and a recommendation engine.  The user is ultimately presented with the top couple plans, along with explanations of why they were recommended.  To make the solution possible, this app has to collect behavioral data logs, use logistic regression to predict the probability that a certain plan would work, and leverage the LETOR ranking mechanism to provide answers.
As an interesting side note, a Schema.org standard for U.S. health insurance networks has recently been adopted.  Eventually, medical groups and insurance companies can publish semantically tagged information directly to the web, bypassing the current single point of collection at CMS.  This would allow for a growth of relevant data that could be used by applications like this one.


 



 



Disclaimer: The challenge prompt used for HHS does not constitute the department’s official stance or endorsement of this activity.  It was used in an unofficial capacity only and intended to take advantage of data newly available from industry due to changes in regulations of the health insurance marketplace. 



 
 





Schema.org publishes health plan and provider network schemas


Leave a reply 


Some good news on healthcare standards
I have been working with the Google semantic web group for many months to design several schemas that represent healthcare provider networks and health insurance plan coverage.  The good news is that these schemas have been officially published for use with Schema.org.  This is the first step towards a wider adoption for a more consistent designation for this type of information.  The schemas are:



Health Insurance Plan: List of health plans and their corresponding network of providers and drug formularies
http://pending.webschemas.org/HealthInsurancePlan


Health Plan Network: Defines a network of providers within an health plan.
http://pending.webschemas.org/HealthPlanNetwork


Health Plan Cost Sharing Specification: List of costs to be paid by the covered beneficiary.
http://pending.webschemas.org/HealthPlanCostSharingSpecification


Health Plan Formulary: Lists of drugs covered by health plan.
http://pending.webschemas.org/HealthPlanFormulary



Now for the background…
In November 2015, the US health agency Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) enacted a new regulatory requirement for health insurers who list plans on insurance marketplaces. They must now publish a machine-readable version of their provider network directory and health plan coverage, publish it to a specified JSON standard, and update it at least monthly. Many major health insurance companies across the US have already started to publish their health plan coverage, provider directories and drug formularies to this standard.
The official schema is kept in a GitHub Repository: https://github.com/CMSgov/QHP-provider-formulary-APIs.  This format makes it possible to see how which changes were made and when.  It also has an issues section to facilitate ongoing discussion about the optimal adoption of the standard.  There’s a website that goes into a more detailed explanation on the background of this effort: https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/marketplace-puf.html. 
This website also includes the “Machine-readable URL PUF” seed file” to the actual data that have been published by insurance company.  This file contains URLs that can be crawled to aggregate the latest plan and provider data.



In terms of adoption, U.S. health plans that participate in insurance markeplaces have published: *

39 states
398 health plans
~26,000 URLs describing insurance coverage, provider networks, drug formularies

* Updated November 2016





A group of companies representing the provider, payer and consumer segments of healthcare convened to discuss the standard throughout 2015.  The considerations that went into formation of the standard can be found at: http://ddod.healthdata.gov/wiki/Interoperability:_Provider_network_directories
 





Open Referral standard


Leave a reply 


The DDOD program is currently assisting the proponents of a new open standard for publishing human services, called Open Referral.  In order for us to be able to justify the promotion of this standard and publication of data to it, we’re first looking to develop clear and concise use cases.
The Background
Open Referral is a standard that originally came out of a Code for America initiative a couple years ago, with the goal of automating the updating of human services offered across many programs.  Doing so would not only make offered services more discoverable, but also lower the cost of administration for the service providers and referring organizations.



The Problem: A landscape of siloed directories
It’s hard to see the safety net. Which agencies provide what services to whom? Where and how can people access them? These details are always in flux. Nonprofit and government agencies are often under-resourced and overwhelmed, and it may not be a priority for them to push information out to attract more customers.
So there are many ‘referral services’ — such as call centers, resource directories, and web applications — that collect directory information about health, human, and social services. However, these directories are all locked in fragmented and redundant silos. As a result of this costly and ineffective status quo:

People in need have difficulty discovering and accessing services that can help them live better lives. 
Service providers struggle to connect clients with other services that can help meet complex needs. 
Decision-makers are unable to gauge the effectiveness of programs at improving community health.
Innovators are stymied by lack of access to data that could power valuable tools for any of the above.  

– Source: Open Referral project description




For potential use cases, there have been a small handful of government programs identified as potential pilots.  These include:

ACL Eldercare services
CMS Health Facilities
ACF Services
VA Clinics
Sacramento (California Health Data Ambassadors program)

 
The Competition
Open Referral is not without competing standards.  In fact, the AIRS/211 Taxonomy is already widely used among certified providers of information and referral services, such as iCarol.  However, AIRS/211 has two drawbacks in comparison with Open Referral.  
First, it’s not a free and open standard.  While there are sample PDFs available for parts of the taxonomy, a full spec requires a subscription.

“If you wish to evaluate the Taxonomy prior to subscribing, you can register for evaluation purposes and have access to the full Taxonomy for a limited period of time through the search function. ”  – Source: UAIRS/211 Download page and Subscription page
The taxonomy also requires an annual license fee, which could be a challenge to continue funding in perpetuity for government and nonprofit organizations.
“Organizations need a license to engage in any use of the Taxonomy.”
 — Source: AIRS/211 Subscription page
Second, the AIRS/221 taxonomy if highly structured and extensive.  While that has advantages for consistency and interoperability, it raises other challenges.  It leads to a high learning curve and therefore sets potentials barriers for organizations without technical expertise.  Open Referral states that it is a more lightweight option.
It should also be noted that there’s a CivicServices schema defined for use with  Schema.org.  Its approach is to embed machine-readable “Microdata” throughout human-readable HTML web pages.  Schema.org standards are intended to be interpreted by web engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo when indexing a website.  That said, the degree of adoption for CivicServices in particular – from either search engines or information publishers – is unclear at this point.
 
Onward!
In concept, the Open Referral standard would lower the cost and lag time for organizations to update relevant services for their constituents.  The standard is being evangelized by Greg Bloom, who has started with Code for America and has been reaching out to organizations who would be consuming this data (such as Crisis Text Line, Purple Binder and iCarol) for the purpose of defining a compelling use case.
There’s a DDOD writeup on this topic at “Interoperability: Directories of health, human and social services”, intended to facilitate creation of practical use cases.

Open Data Discoverability


Leave a reply 


I’m adding a working document to cover the topic of open data discoverability and usability.  It appears as though this is an area that is in desperate need for attention.  I have come across it tangentially throughout much of my work.  It deserves to be aggregated and curated.  There are also some lingering opportunities to make practical use of semantic web concepts.  There are vast repositories of data assets throughout government, academia and industry that could be better leveraged.  So lets make it happen.
 
 
 Open Data Discoverability  from David Portnoy
 





DDOD featured on Digital Gov


Leave a reply 


The Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) program has recently been featured on DigitalGov.  (See DigitalGov article.)
It should be added, that a major project in the works is the merging of DDOD tools and methodologies into the larger HealthData.gov program.  The effort seeks to maximize the value of existing data assets from across HHS agencies (CMS, FDA, CDC, NIH, etc.).  Already planned are new features to enhance data discoverability and usability.
We’re also looking into how to improve the growing knowledge base of DDOD use cases by leveraging semantic web and linked open data (LOD) concepts.  A couple years ago, HHS organized the Health Data Platform Metadata Challenge – Health 2.0.  The findings from this exercise could be leveraged for both DDOD and HealthData.gov.
