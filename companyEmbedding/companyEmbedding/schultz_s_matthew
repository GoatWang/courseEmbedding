Tempe Attorney Matthew S. Schultz Suspended for One Year
PHOENIX – Aug. 4, 2014 – Attorney Matthew S. Schultz of Tempe was suspended from the practice of law for violating the Rules of Professional Conduct.
On July 24, 2014, the Presiding Disciplinary Judge of the Arizona Supreme Court ordered that Schultz be suspended for one year.
Matthew S. Schultz, a family law practitioner, admitted that he engaged in a conflict of interest by having an intimate and sexual relationship with his family law client. In a separate case, a hearing panel imposed on Schultz a 30-day suspension for engaging in unprofessional conduct in a family court case. In the latter case, Schultz wrote a letter to a child custody evaluatorthat included unprofessional and offensive references to the opposing party and judge. The panel also concluded that Schultz's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice by instigating an otherwise unnecessary burden on the court.
Matthew S. Schultz's suspension is effective on Sept. 1, 2014. He was ordered to pay $5,214.63 to the State Bar of Arizona for costs and expenses incurred for the hearing and during its investigations. Upon reinstatement, he will be placed on one year of supervised probation by the Member Assistance Program. He must also complete the State Bar's Professionalism Course.
Consumers may report attorney misconduct by calling the State Bar of Arizona Attorney/Consumer Assistance Program (A/CAP) hotline at 602.340.7280.

I’m a tech with a passion for design, user experience, and products. I develop ideas, create plans, form strategies, iterate roadmaps, build teams, and deliver results. I seek out opportunities to solve problems, push boundaries, communicate with audiences, connect people, and deliver products people love to use. I illustrate need, make business cases, deliver value, and wield a simple stick. I am a disrupter of “because that’s the way we’ve always done it but we don’t know why.”
I’m in love with digital and building products: mobile, emerging media, social, big data, and visualization, but my interest in a user’s experience borders on obsessive. I’m an early adopter, a big thinker, and chief trend spotter. I own Product at iCrossing and Core Audience. I manage a team of Agile product managers, program managers, and business analysts who guide, shape, and drive our industry acclaimed products. Using agile methodologies, my team is responsible for the successful partnership between business owners, end users, and engineers. I believe that providing value is simple if you can listen, learn, derive, communicate, and most importantly, deliver. I transform observations, learnings, and understanding into simple and powerful solutions. I am constantly working to iteratively improve, refine, and enhance our applications into products our customers love to use.
I’m a technologist at heart, by skill, and by experience, but my love of design, my belief that the user experience is the application, and my understanding that strategy and process are critical to success, differentiates me from the rest of the pack. I also believe that the web hasn’t just become social; social is its raison d’être.
