Outthinking Cancer


Cancer is the Ultimate Engineering Challenge.
Cancer dynamics are modeled. System‑level interactions are simulated. Precise trials are developed. Treatment regimens are created. Patient care is reimagined.








DEVELOPMENT WITH FOCUS.
Because tumors within the same cancer type vary greatly, a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment cannot always work. Merrimack’s investigational products are precisely engineered, and our clinical trials are developed with a singular focus on the patient population most likely to benefit.
In Development




Qualifications: Rigor. Creativity.
We hail from diverse backgrounds, both personally and professionally. Yet we share a goal of building cures. Creativity sets our path. Patient, determined steps carry us forward.

	Merrimack is a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is outthinking cancer to ensure that patients and their families live fulfilling lives. Our mission is to transform cancer care through the smart design and development of targeted solutions based on the deep understanding of cancer pathways and biological markers. All of our product candidates, including three in clinical studies and several others in preclinical development, fit into our three-pronged strategy of 1) understanding the biological problems we are trying to solve, 2) designing specific solutions and 3) developing those solutions in biomarker-enriched homogenous patient populations. Through systems biology, which brings together the fields of biology, computing and engineering, Merrimack aims to decrease the uncertainty in drug development and clinical validation. Such an approach has the potential to make individualized treatment of patients a reality.

The tools did not exist.
So we built them.

A highly complex engineering challenge often comes with its own set of tertiary challenges. When Merrimack was founded with the aspiration to find cures for cancer, one such challenge was measuring cancer system dynamics.
Merrimack helped develop the first high-density protein arrays, a groundbreaking technology at the time, that made the measurement of system dynamics possible. As a result, we were able to build computational models that could predict system behavior, and gain valuable insight into tumor anatomy, addiction, and adaptation.

	Merrimack is a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is outthinking cancer to ensure that patients and their families live fulfilling lives. Our mission is to transform cancer care through the smart design and development of targeted solutions based on the deep understanding of cancer pathways and biological markers. All of our product candidates, including three in clinical studies and several others in preclinical development, fit into our three-pronged strategy of 1) understanding the biological problems we are trying to solve, 2) designing specific solutions and 3) developing those solutions in biomarker-enriched homogenous patient populations. Through systems biology, which brings together the fields of biology, computing and engineering, Merrimack aims to decrease the uncertainty in drug development and clinical validation. Such an approach has the potential to make individualized treatment of patients a reality.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Outthinking Cancer


Cancer is the Ultimate Engineering Challenge.
Cancer dynamics are modeled. System‑level interactions are simulated. Precise trials are developed. Treatment regimens are created. Patient care is reimagined.








DEVELOPMENT WITH FOCUS.
Because tumors within the same cancer type vary greatly, a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment cannot always work. Merrimack’s investigational products are precisely engineered, and our clinical trials are developed with a singular focus on the patient population most likely to benefit.
In Development




Qualifications: Rigor. Creativity.
We hail from diverse backgrounds, both personally and professionally. Yet we share a goal of building cures. Creativity sets our path. Patient, determined steps carry us forward.
