	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
	Statements (unaudited)


	 






	Note 1:


	Basis of Presentation





	 




	Community
	Savings Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), headquartered in Caldwell, Ohio, was formed to serve as the stock holding company
	for Community Savings (the “Bank”) following its mutual-to-stock conversion. The conversion was completed effective
	January 10, 2017.  The Company issued 441,290 shares at an offering price of $10.00 per share.




	 




	The
	Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion
	of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair presentation of
	the unaudited financial statements have been included to present fairly the financial position as of March 31, 2017 and the results
	of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. All interim amounts have not been audited
	and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017, herein are not necessarily indicative of the
	results of operations to be expected for the entire fiscal year.



	 



	The
	accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 has been derived from audited financial statements included
	in the registrant’s Form S-1. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
	prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated
	financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto of the Company
	as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 included in the Registrant’s Form S-1.




	 



	Principles of Consolidation


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements
	as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2017, include Community Savings Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Community
	Savings (the “Bank”), together referred to as the “Company.” Intercompany transactions and
	balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months
	ended March 31, 2016 represent the Bank only, as the conversion to stock form, including the formation of Community Savings Bancorp,
	Inc., was completed on January 10, 2017. References herein to the “Company” for periods prior to the completion of
	the stock conversion should be deemed to refer to the “Bank.”


	 


	Use of Estimates


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Material estimates that are particularly susceptible
	to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation of real estate acquired in connection
	with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, valuation of deferred tax assets and fair values of financial instruments.

	Other-than-temporary Impairment


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the decline in
	fair value of the Company’s investment securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. The
	contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost
	bases of the investments. Because the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not
	be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, the Company does not consider these securities
	to be other-than-temporarily impaired at March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016.

	The risk characteristics applicable to each segment
	of the loan portfolio are described below:


	 



	Residential Real Estate and Home Equity Lines of
	Credit



	 


	Residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of
	credit are secured by one-to four-family residences and are comprised of owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied loans. Construction
	real estate loans (immaterial for the periods presented) are usually based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed
	project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment
	of these loans may include permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent
	financing is obtained. The Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance
	if that ratio is exceeded. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be
	impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in
	property values or residential properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread
	over a large number of borrowers.

	Multi-family Residential Real
	Estate



	 


	Multi-family real estate loans generally involve a
	greater degree of credit risk than one-to four- family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased
	credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers,
	the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring
	these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family real estate is typically dependent upon the successful
	operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay
	the loan may be impaired.


	 



	Commercial Real Estate



	 


	Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily
	as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan
	principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing
	the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected
	by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The characteristics of properties securing the Company’s
	real estate portfolio are diverse, but with geographic location almost entirely in the Company’s market area. Management
	monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. In general, the Company
	avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk.


	 



	Consumer Loans



	 


	Consumer loans entail greater credit risk than residential
	mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such
	as automobiles. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment
	for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the
	borrower. In particular, amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the
	condition of the automobiles and the lack of demand for used automobiles.

	Internal Risk Categories




	 


	The Company has adopted a standard loan grading system
	for all loans. Loans are selected for a grading review based on certain characteristics, including credit concentrations, subprime
	criteria and delinquency of 90 days or more. Definitions are as follows:



	 




	Pass


	:

	These are higher quality loans
	that do not fit any of the other categories described below.



	 




	Special Mention

	: The loans identified as special
	mention have an obvious flaw or a potential weakness that deserves special management attention, but which has not yet impacted
	collectability. These flaws or weaknesses, if left uncorrected, may result in the deterioration of the prospects of repayment or
	the deterioration of the Company’s credit position.


	 



	Substandard

	: These are loans with a well-defined
	weakness, where the Company has a serious concern about the borrower’s ability to make full repayment if the weaknesses are
	not corrected. The loan may contain a flaw, which could impact the borrower’s ability to repay, or the borrower’s continuance
	as a “going concern.” When collateral values are not sufficient to secure the loan and other weaknesses are present,
	the loan may be rated substandard. A loan will also be rated substandard when full repayment is expected, but it must come from
	the liquidation of collateral.

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
	Statements (unaudited)


	 


	One-to-four family residential real estate loans and
	home equity loans that are past due 90 days or more with loan to value ratios greater than 60 percent are classified as substandard.



	 




	Doubtful

	: These are loans with major defined
	weaknesses, where future charge-off of a part of the credit is highly likely. The primary repayment source is no longer viable
	and the viability of the secondary source of repayment is in doubt. The amount of loss is uncertain due to circumstances within
	the credit that are not yet fully developed and the loan is rated “Doubtful” until the loss can be accurately estimated.


	 



	Loss

	: These are near term charge-offs. Loans
	classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that it is not desirable to continue carrying them as
	assets on the Company’s financial statements, even though partial recovery may be possible at some future time.

	A loan is considered impaired when based on current
	information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with
	the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming loans, but also include loans modified in troubled debt

	At March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the Company had
	certain loans that were modified in troubled debt restructurings and impaired. The modification of terms of such loans included
	one or a combination of the following: an extension of maturity, a reduction of the stated interest rate or a permanent reduction
	of the recorded investment in the loan. The Company had loans modified, in previous years, in a troubled debt restructuring totaling
	$86,000 and $92,000 at March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Troubled debt restructured loans had specific allowances
	totaling $6,000 and $7,000 at March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. At March 31, 2017, the Company had no commitments
	to lend additional funds to borrowers with troubled debt restructured loans.


	 


	No loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings
	during either the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016.


	 


	The Company had no troubled debt restructurings modified
	during the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016 that subsequently defaulted during the nine-month periods ended March 31,
	2017 or 2016. A troubled debt restructured loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due
	under the loan’s modified terms.


	 


	In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing
	financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its
	debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company’s internal underwriting
	policy.

	Note 4:        Regulatory Matters


	 


	The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital
	requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory,
	and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s
	consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
	action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities,
	and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and
	classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
	Furthermore, the Bank’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in these financial statements.


	 


	Quantitative measures established by regulation to
	ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total capital,
	Tier I capital, and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of leverage
	capital to adjusted average total assets (as defined).


	 


	Management believes, as of March 31, 2017 and June
	30, 2016, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.


	 


	Basel III was effective for the Bank on January 1,
	2015. Basel III requires the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets,
	as defined in the regulation. Under the new Basel III rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including
	dividends, the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
	assets ratio. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from zero percent to 2.50 percent by 2019. Under Basel III, the
	Bank elected to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the most recent
	notification categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized
	as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total capital, Tier I capital, common equity Tier 1 capital and leverage capital
	ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed
	the Bank’s category.

	Note 5:        Disclosures about
	Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities


	 


	Fair value is the exchange price that would be received
	to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
	in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of
	observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used
	to measure fair value:



	 





	 



	Level 1



	Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.




	 


	 


	 




	 



	Level 2

	Available-for-sale Securities


	 


	Where quoted market prices are available in an active
	market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values
	are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing
	models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to yield curves,
	interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flow. Such securities are classified
	within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies
	and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated
	balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified
	within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.


	 


	Impaired Loans (Collateral Dependent)


	 


	The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations
	of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation
	approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the
	appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
	Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.
	Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging
	reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical

	knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time
	of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the borrower and borrower’s business, resulting in a
	Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.




	 






	Foreclosed Assets




	 


	Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure
	are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The assets are subsequently
	accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals
	which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of
	approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent
	appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant
	and typically result in a level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated
	on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.


	 


	Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans
	and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential
	appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once
	received, a member of management reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting
	fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.

	(Level 3) Inputs

	The following methods were used to estimate the fair
	value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at amounts other
	than fair value.


	 


	Cash and Cash Equivalents and Interest-earning
	Time Deposits


	 


	The carrying amount of cash, short-term instruments
	and time deposits approximate fair value and are classified as Level 1.


	 


	Other Investment Securities


	 


	Due to restrictions placed on their transferability,
	the FHLB and COCC stock are carried at cost, which approximates fair value based on redemption provisions resulting in a Level
	3 classification.

	Statements (unaudited)


	 


	Loans


	 


	Fair values of loans are estimated as follows: For
	variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values,
	resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest
	rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality, resulting in a Level 3 classification.
	Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value of collateral as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate
	the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.


	 


	Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable


	 


	The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate
	fair value, resulting in a Level 2 classification.


	 


	Deposits


	 


	The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g.,
	interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to
	the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. The carrying
	amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting
	date resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted
	cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected
	monthly maturities on time deposits, resulting in a Level 2 classification.


	 


	Federal Home Loan Bank Advances


	 


	The fair values of FHLB advances are estimated using
	discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, resulting in a
	Level 2 classification.


	 


	Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance


	 


	The fair value of escrow accounts is estimated to approximate
	the carrying amount resulting in a Level 2 classification.


	 


	Off-Balance Sheet Instruments


	 


	Fair values of off-balance sheet, credit-related
	financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms
	of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material.

	Note 7:        Recent Accounting
	Pronouncements


	 



	FASB ASU 2014-09,


	Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers

	. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amended guidance on revenue
	recognition from contracts with customers. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting
	for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most contract revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific
	guidance. The core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
	goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
	for those goods or services. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
	and interim periods within the reporting period, and should be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented
	or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application.
	Early adoption is prohibited. Management is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on the Company’s
	financial statements.



	 




	FASB ASU 2016-01,


	Recognition and Measurement
	of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

	In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
	2016-01, 

	Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

	. For public business entities, the
	amendments in this update include the elimination of the requirement to disclose the method(s) and

	significant assumptions used to estimate fair value
	that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, the requirement to
	use the exit price notion when measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, the requirement to present
	separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change
	in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the
	fair value option for financial instruments, the requirement for separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities
	by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or
	accompanying notes to the financial statements, and the amendments clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation
	allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax
	assets.


	 


	For public business entities, the amendments in
	this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
	Early adoption of the amendments in this update is not permitted, except that early application by public business entities to
	financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued or, by all other entities, that have not
	yet been made available for issuance are permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption for the following amendment:
	An entity should present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
	resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value
	in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. An entity should apply the amendments to this update by means
	of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Management is currently
	evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the Company’s financial statements.


	 



	FASB ASU 2016-02,


	Leases.

	In February
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for
	all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:


	 




	 



	·




	A lease liability, which is a lessee‘s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and





	 




	 



	·




	A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.





	 


	Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely
	unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model
	and Topic 606,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	.


	 


	The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for
	sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer
	be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing.


	 


	Public business entities should apply the amendments
	in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January
	1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities upon issuance. Lessees (for
	capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct

	financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified
	retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period
	presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases
	that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition
	approach. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the Company’s financial statements.


	 



	FASB ASU 2016-13,


	Financial Instruments-Credit
	Losses.

	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13. The amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss model for recognition
	of credit losses with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses over the life of the loan and requires consideration of
	a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. The amendments are effective for
	public business entities for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently
	evaluating the impact of these amendments to the Company’s financial position and results of operations.


	 


	Note 8:        Loss Per Share


	 


	Loss per share disclosures are not applicable to the
	three and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, because the Company did not complete the conversion to stock form until
	January 10, 2017.


	 


	Note 9:        Employee Stock
	Ownership Plan (ESOP)


	 


	As part of the Company’s stock conversion, shares
	were purchased by the ESOP with a loan from Community Savings Bancorp, Inc. All employees of the Bank meeting certain tenure requirements
	are entitled to participate in the ESOP. Compensation expense related to the ESOP was $0 for both the three and nine-month periods
	ended March 31, 2017

	.



	 


	The stock price at the formation date was $10.00.
	The aggregate fair value of the 32,688 unallocated shares was $449,460 based on the $13.75 closing price of our common stock on
	March 31, 2017.


	 



	Note 10:      Plan of Conversion and Change in Corporate Form



	 


	On August 25, 2016, the Board of Directors adopted
	a Plan of Conversion (the “Plan”) to convert from a federal mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank (the
	“Conversion”).  A new Maryland-chartered corporation, Community Savings Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”),
	was formed in August 2016, which, upon consummation of the Conversion and offering, became the savings and loan holding company
	of Community Savings (the “Bank”). The Plan was subject to approval of the members of the Bank, which approval was
	received at a Special Meeting of Members on December 21, 2016.

	Additionally, the Plan was subject to the final approval
	of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the formation of the Company as the holding company of
	the Bank, upon consummation of the Conversion, was subject to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
	(“FRB”). As part of the Conversion and offering, the Company filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities
	and Exchange Commission.  Upon receipt of the final approval of the OCC and the FRB and the consummation of the Conversion
	and offering, the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company issued and sold shares of its capital
	stock to eligible depositors and borrowers of the Bank and the public pursuant to an independent valuation appraisal of the Bank
	and the Company on a converted basis that has been conducted by an independent appraisal firm that is experienced in appraising
	financial institutions in connection with mutual to stock conversions. The Conversion was completed on January 10, 2017 and resulted
	in the issuance of 441,290 common shares by the Company.  


	 


	The cost of the Conversion and issuing the capital
	stock totaled $1.15 million and was deducted from the proceeds of the offering.


	 


	In accordance with OCC regulations, at the time of
	the Conversion, the Bank substantially restricted retained earnings by establishing a liquidation account.  The liquidation
	account will be maintained for the benefit of eligible holders who continue to maintain their accounts at the Bank after the Conversion.  The
	liquidation account will be reduced annually to the extent that eligible account holders have reduced their qualifying deposits.
	Subsequent increases will not restore an eligible account holder’s interest in the liquidation account.  In the
	event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a
	distribution from the liquidation account in an amount proportionate to the adjusted qualifying account balances then held.  The
	Bank may not pay dividends if those dividends would reduce equity capital below the required liquidation account amount.

	be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,”
	“anticipate,” “plan,” “seek,” “expect” and similar expressions. These forward-looking
	statements include: statements of goals, intentions and expectations, statements regarding prospects and business strategy, statements
	regarding asset quality and market risk, and estimates of future costs, benefits and results.


	 


	These forward-looking statements are subject to significant
	risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, among other things, the following: (1) general economic conditions, (2) competitive
	pressure among financial services companies, (3) changes in interest rates, (4) deposit flows, (5) loan demand, (6) changes in
	legislation or regulation, (7) changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines and (8) other economic, competitive, governmental,
	regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services.


	 


	Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future
	results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. We have no obligation to update
	or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any changed assumptions, any unanticipated events or any changes in the future.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results
	of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
	used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts
	of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and
	assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the
	circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change
	that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.


	 


	The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS
	Act”) contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies.
	As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public
	companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
	Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

	The following represent our critical accounting policies:




	 






	Allowance for Loan Losses.


	The allowance for loan
	losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at
	the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income. In
	determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our
	most critical accounting policies.


	 


	Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance
	for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current
	economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral,
	the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently
	subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.


	 


	The analysis has two components, specific and general allowances.
	The specific percentage allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is
	measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the
	collateral, adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan’s carrying
	value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined
	by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical
	loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes
	historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance
	for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance
	for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the
	historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses
	may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial
	results.




	 






	Deferred Tax Assets.


	We use the asset and liability
	method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
	consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
	their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
	income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced
	by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise
	significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments
	require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets,
	which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Determining the proper
	valuation allowance for deferred taxes is critical in properly valuing the deferred tax asset and the related recognition of income
	tax expense or benefit. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us
	to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.

	Fair Value Measurements


	. The fair value of a financial
	instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
	other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset
	impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices,
	quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs,
	such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable
	market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating
	these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level
	of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Company can be found in Note 13 of the Financial Statements “–
	Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities,” included in the Registrant’s S-1 filing.


	 



	Comparison of Financial
	Condition at March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016



	 




	Total Assets.


	Total assets increased $1.3 million,
	or 2.4%, to $55.6 million at March 31, 2017 from $54.3 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase
	in cash and due from banks as deposits increased $1.4 million, including $735,000 in deposits owned by Community Savings Bancorp,
	which were received in our stock offering which was consummated on January 10, 2017.



	 





	Cash and Cash Equivalents.


	Cash and cash equivalents
	increased $4.9 million, or 152.7%, to $8.0 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due
	to proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities of $2.1 million, proceeds from net loan repayments of $1.3 million
	and the increase in deposits of $1.4 million.




	 






	Interest-earning Time Deposits in Other Financial Institutions.


	Interest-earning time deposits in other financial institutions decreased $238,000, or 4.3%, to $5.3 million at March 31,
	2017 from $5.6 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was due to net maturities of these deposits during the period.




	 






	Securities available-for-sale.


	Investment securities
	available-for-sale decreased $2.1 million, or 18.8%, to $9.0 million at March 31, 2017 from $11.1 million at June 30, 2016. The
	decrease in securities available-for-sale was primarily due to maturities of securities of $2.1 million and principal repayments
	on mortgage-backed securities totaling $1.2 million, partially offset by purchases of $1.5 million.




	 






	Net Loans.


	Net loans decreased $1.3 million, or
	3.9%, to $31.4 million at March 31, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016. The decrease in net loans was due primarily to a decrease of
	$1.0 million, or 19.2%, in consumer loans to $3.9 million at March 31, 2017 from $4.9 million at June 30, 2016. Loans originated
	during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $3.0 million, of which $2.7 million were loans secured by one-to four-family
	residential real estate.

	Deposits.


	Deposits increased $1.4 million or 3.4%,
	to $41.5 million at March 31, 2017 from $40.1 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was comprised primarily of growth in demand
	deposits of $1.1 million, or 12.2%, and savings and money market accounts of $253,000, or 1.1%.




	 






	FHLB Advances.


	FHLB advances decreased $2.8 million,
	or 37.9%, to $4.5 million at March 31, 2017 from $7.3 million at June 30, 2016, as we utilized funds from maturing interest-earning
	time deposits in other financial institutions and investment securities available for sale to repay certain FHLB advances.




	 






	Shareholders’ Equity



	.

	Shareholders’
	equity increased $2.7 million, or 41.0%, to $9.4 million at March 31, 2017 from $6.7 million at June 30, 2016. The increase was
	due primarily to net proceeds from the common stock offering of $2.9 million, which was offset by the net loss of $94,000 and an
	increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $115,000 during the period.



	 




	Comparison of Operating
	Results for the Three-Month Periods Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016



	 




	General.


	For the three months ended March 31,
	2017, we had a net loss of $44,000 compared to net income of $6,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $50,000.
	The net loss resulted primarily from a decrease in net interest income of $12,000, a decrease in noninterest income of $7,000,
	and an increase of $71,000 in noninterest expense, which were offset in part by an increase of $40,000 in federal income tax benefit.


	 




	Average Balance Sheets.


	The
	following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the three month
	period ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation
	of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the
	effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are accreted to interest income.

	Interest Income.


	Interest income decreased $13,000,
	or 2.9%, to $430,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $443,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease
	resulted primarily from a $13,000 decrease in interest on investment securities. The average balance of investment securities decreased
	$3.5 million, or 27.2%, to $9.4 million during the three months ended March 31,

	2017 from $12.9 million during the three months ended March
	31, 2016, partially offset by an increase in the average yield on investment securities of 16 basis points to 2.04% for the 2017
	period from 1.88% for the 2016 period. The average balance of loans receivable increased $383,000, or 1.2%, to $32.2 million during
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $31.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, while the average yield
	on loans decreased nine basis points to 4.30% during the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 4.39% during the year earlier period,
	reflecting lower market interest rates.


	 




	Interest Expense.


	Interest expense decreased $1,000,
	or 1.9%, to $53,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $54,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Interest
	expense on deposits increased $1,000, or 3.2%, to $32,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $31,000 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of deposits of two basis points
	to 0.38% from 0.36% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was partially offset by a decrease
	of $658,000, or 1.9%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $33.7 million for the three month period in 2017 from
	$34.4 million for the comparable period in 2016. Interest expense on borrowings decreased $2,000, or 8.7%, to $21,000 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 from $23,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The average balance of FHLB advances decreased
	$2.5 million to $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016,
	while the average cost of these advances increased 46 basis points to 1.68% from 1.22% period-to-period.




	 






	Net Interest Income

	.

	Net interest income decreased
	$12,000, or 3.1%, to $377,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $389,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
	Our net interest rate spread decreased to 2.72% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 2.81% for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, and our net interest margin decreased to 2.87% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 2.92% for the comparable
	three-month period in 2016.


	 




	Provision for Loan Losses.


	Based on our analysis
	of the factors described in “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Loan Losses,” we did not record a provision
	for loan losses for either of the three months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016. The allowance for loan losses was $253,000, or 0.80%
	of total loans at March 31, 2017, compared to $253,000, or 0.79% of total loans at March 31, 2016. Total nonperforming loans were
	$372,000 at March 31, 2017, compared to $283,000 at March 31, 2016. Classified (substandard, doubtful and loss) loans were $1.0
	million at March 31, 2017, compared to $792,000 at March 31, 2016, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were $221,000
	and $177,000 at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Bank had no net charge-offs during the three months ended March 31,
	2017 compared to $14,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan
	losses was 68.0% at March 31, 2017 compared to 89.4% at March 31, 2016.


	 


	The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe
	to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at March 31, 2017 and 2016. While
	we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, the actual
	amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required
	may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.


	 




	Noninterest Income



	.

	Noninterest income
	decreased $7,000, or 10.6%, to $59,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $66,000 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016. Service charges and

	fees decreased by $3,000 to $58,000 during the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 compared to $61,000 for the same period in 2016.




	 






	Noninterest Expense.


	Noninterest expense increased
	$71,000, or 16.0%, to $515,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $444,000 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016. Salaries and benefits increased $25,000, or 13.1%, due primarily to the addition of a new loan officer. Data processing
	increased by $26,000, or 42.6% as we continue to improve our cyber-security protection, and our correspondent bank service charges
	were up by $15,000, or 35.7% due to increased interchange activity. Other expenses decreased by $7,000 or 14.0%, to $43,000 from
	$50,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to a decrease in foreclosure expense of $8,000. FDIC insurance premiums
	decreased by $6,000 due to a decrease in the insurance rates period-to-period.


	 


	Noninterest expense can be expected to increase because of costs
	associated with operating as a public company and increased compensation costs related to possible implementation of a stock-based
	benefit plan, if approved by our stockholders. Additionally, we intend to withdraw from our multiple-employer defined benefit plan
	and expect to incur a one-time charge of approximately $1.6 million in connection with this withdrawal.


	 




	Federal Income Taxes.


	We recognized a federal
	income tax benefit of $35,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to a tax expense of $5,000 recognized during
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, due primarily to the $90,000 increase in the net loss period to period.



	 




	Comparison of Operating
	Results for the Nine-Month Periods Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016



	 




	General.


	For the nine months ended March 31, 2017,
	we had net loss of $94,000 compared to net income of $652,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $746,000.
	The decrease in net income resulted primarily from a decrease of $800,000 in noninterest income, which included an $810,000 one-time
	gain on sale of branch offices realized in the 2016 period and a decrease of $42,000 in net interest income, which were offset
	in part by a decrease of $8,000 in noninterest expense and a decrease of $88,000 in federal income taxes.


	 




	Average Balance Sheets.


	The
	following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated.
	All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have
	been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs,
	discounts and premiums that are accreted to interest income.

	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL


	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 




	Interest Income.


	Interest income decreased $44,000,
	or 3.3%, to $1.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease
	resulted primarily from a $57,000 decrease in interest on investment securities offset in part by a $16,000 increase in interest
	on loans receivable. The average balance of investment securities decreased $4.7 million, or 32.5%, to $9.7 million during the
	nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $14.4 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, and the average yield on investment
	securities increased 14 basis points to 2.05% for the 2017 period from 1.91% for the 2016 period. The average balance of loans
	receivable increased $1.6 million, or 5.2%, to $32.5 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $30.9 million during
	the nine months ended March 31, 2016, but the average yield on loans decreased 16 basis points to 4.33% during the nine months
	ended March 31, 2017 from 4.49% during the year earlier period, reflecting lower market interest rates.


	 




	Interest Expense.


	Interest expense decreased $2,000,
	or 1.2%, to $159,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $161,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. Interest
	expense on deposits decreased $9,000, or 8.7%, to $94,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $103,000 for the nine months
	ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $2.4 million, or 6.8%, in the average balance of interest-bearing
	deposits to $33.3 million for the nine month period in 2017 from $35.7 million for the comparable period in 2016. The average cost
	of interest-bearing deposits remained at 0.38% for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest expense on borrowings
	increased $7,000 to $65,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $58,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The
	average balance of FHLB advances decreased $1.0 million to $5.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $6.9 million
	for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, while the average cost of these advances increased 34 basis points to 1.46% from 1.12%
	period-to-period.




	 






	Net Interest Income

	.

	Net interest income decreased
	$42,000, or 3.5%, to $1.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $1.2 million for the nine months ended March 31,
	2016. Our net interest rate spread increased to 2.87% for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from 2.83% for the nine months ended
	March 31, 2016, and our net interest margin increased to 2.99% for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from 2.93% for the comparable
	nine-month period in 2016.


	 




	Provision for Loan Losses.


	Based on our analysis
	of the factors described in “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Loan Losses,” we did not record a provision
	for loan losses for either of the nine months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016. The allowance for loan losses was $253,000, or 0.80%
	of total loans at March 31, 2017, compared to $253,000, or 0.79% of total loans at March 31, 2016. Total nonperforming loans were
	$372,000 at March 31, 2017, compared to $283,000 at March 31, 2016. Classified (substandard, doubtful and loss) loans were $1.0
	million at March 31, 2017, compared to $792,000 at March 31, 2016, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were $221,000
	and $177,000 at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Bank had no net charge-offs during the nine months ended March 31, 2017
	compared to $35,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses
	was 68.0% at March 31, 2017 compared to 89.4% at March 31, 2016.


	 


	The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe
	to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at March 31, 2017 and 2016. While
	we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, the

	actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of
	past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact our financial condition and results
	of operations.




	 






	Noninterest Income



	.

	Noninterest income
	decreased $800,000, or 77.8%, to $228,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 from $1.0 million for the nine months ended
	March 31, 2016. The decrease was due to the gain on the sale of the branches of $810,000 during the 2016 period. Service charges
	and fees decreased $21,000, or 10.0%, to $188,000 during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $209,000 during the same
	period in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by a gain on the sale of foreclosed assets of $29,000 in the nine months ending
	March 2017 compared to a net gain of $1,000 on foreclosed assets sold during the same period in 2016 and an increase of $3,000
	in other operating income in the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the 2016 period.




	 






	Noninterest Expense.


	Noninterest expense decreased
	$8,000, or 0.5%, to $1.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was
	due primarily to a decrease in occupancy and equipment of $17,000, or 18.3% attributable to non-recurring expense during the 2016
	period, a decrease in data processing of $9,000, or 3.6%, as a result of having two less branch offices, and a decrease in FDIC
	premiums of $35,000, due to a decrease in the insurance rates period to period. These decreases were partially offset by an increase
	in salaries, employee benefits and directors’ fees of $28,000 or 4.7%, and an increase in correspondent bank service charges
	of $33,000, or 23.2%, as a result of our switch from VISA to Master Card. We anticipate reimbursement of most of that expense per
	our contract.


	 


	Noninterest expense can be expected to increase because of costs
	associated with operating as a public company and increased compensation costs related to possible implementation of a stock-based
	benefit plan, if approved by our stockholders. Additionally, we intend to withdraw from our multiple-employer defined benefit plan
	and expect to incur a one-time charge of approximately $1.6 million in connection with this withdrawal.




	 






	Federal Income Taxes.


	We recognized a federal
	income tax benefit of $56,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $32,000 in expense recognized during the nine
	months ended March 31, 2016.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital
	Resources



	 


	Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest
	payments on loans, and advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable
	sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions,
	and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-earning demand deposits. The levels
	of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.


	 


	Our cash flows are comprised of three primary
	classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by (used
	in) operating activities was $(64,000) and $54,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash

	provided by (used in) investing activities
	was $3.3 million and $(11.6) million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in cash flows
	in investing activities resulted primarily from the sale of two branch offices in July 2015 which resulted in cash paid of $12.6
	million during the nine months ended March 31, 2016. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 million and $5.6 million in
	the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 


	Community Savings is subject to various regulatory capital requirements,
	including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework
	for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At
	March 31, 2017, Community Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was categorized as “well-capitalized”
	under regulatory guidelines.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet
	Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations



	 




	Commitments.


	At March 31, 2017,
	we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $1.0 million, we had commitments under undisbursed construction loans of $83,000
	and commitments under home equity lines of credit of $2.3 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to
	meet our current loan origination commitments.


	 


	Certificates of deposit that are scheduled
	to mature in less than one year from March 31, 2017 totaled $4.0 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the
	maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize
	FHLB-Cincinnati advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest
	expense.




	 






	Contractual Obligations.


	In
	the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing
	services, operating leases for equipment and a branch location, and agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.

	CERTIFICATION



	 


	I, Alvin B. Parmiter, certify that:


	 


	1.       I
	have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Community Savings Bancorp, Inc.;


	 


	2.       Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
	the period covered by this report;


	 


	3.       Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
	respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
	in this report;


	 


	4.       The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:


	 


	a) designed such disclosure
	controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
	material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
	those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;


	 


	b) evaluated the effectiveness
	of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
	of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and


	 


	c) disclosed in this report
	any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most
	recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
	is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and


	 


	5.       The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
	financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons
	performing the equivalent functions):


	 


	a) all significant deficiencies
	and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
	adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


	 


	b) any fraud, whether or not
	material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over
	financial reporting.

Item
1.01



Entry Into
a Material Definitive Agreement




 

On
November 14, 2016, Community Savings Bancorp, Inc., (the
“Company”) and Community Savings entered into an Agency
Agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
(“KBW”), which will assist in the marketing of the
Company’s common stock during its stock offering.

 

For these
services, KBW has received a management fee of $30,000 and will
receive a success fee of $250,000 for shares sold in the
subscription and community offering. The management fee will be
credited against the success fee. If, as a result of a
resolicitation, KBW determines that it is required or requested to
provide significant services, KBW will receive an additional fee
not to exceed $25,000.

 

In the
event that KBW sells shares of common stock through a group of
broker-dealers in a syndicated community offering, KBW will be paid
the success fee described above as well as a transaction fee, which
fee, along with the fee payable to selected dealers (which will
include KBW) will not exceed 6.0% in the aggregate of the dollar
amount of total shares sold in the syndicated community offering;
provided, however, that the amount of the success fee shall be
credited on a dollar-for-dollar basis against any such transaction
fee. Any such offering will be on a best efforts basis, and KBW
will serve as sole book-running manager in such an
offering.

 

The
shares of common stock are being offered pursuant to a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-213561) filed by the
Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and a related
prospectus dated November 14, 2016.

 

The
foregoing description of the terms of the Agency Agreement is
qualified in its entirety by references to the Agency Agreement,
which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated by reference
herein.

Ladies and
Gentlemen:

 

Community
Savings Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “
Company ”), and Community Savings, a
federally-chartered mutual savings bank (the “
Bank ” and, together with the Company, the
“ CS Parties ”), hereby confirm, jointly
and severally, their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods,
Inc. (“ KBW ” or the “
Agent ”), as follows:

 

Section 1.
The Offering . The Bank,
in accordance with the Plan of Conversion of dated August 25, 2016
(the “ Plan ”), intends to convert from
mutual to stock form and to reorganize into a holding company
structure as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “
Conversion ”). All capitalized terms used in
this Agency Agreement (this “ Agreement
”) and not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
set forth in the Plan. The Conversion is being conducted in
accordance with the laws of the United States and the applicable
regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the
“ OCC ”) (such laws and the regulations
are referred to herein as the “ Conversion
Regulations ”). In connection with the Conversion,
the Company will offer shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value
per share ( “ Common Stock ”), in a
subscription offering (the “ Subscription
Offering ”) to (1) depositors of the Bank with
$50.00 or more on deposit as of the close of business on January 1,
2015 (“ Eligible Account Holders ”),
(2) tax-qualified employee plans of the Bank,
(3) depositors of the Bank with $50.00 or more on deposit as
of the close of business on September 30, 2016 (“
Supplemental Eligible Account Holders ”), and
(4) other eligible depositors of the Bank as of the close of
business on October 31, 2016 and eligible borrowers of the Bank as
of May 26, 2004 who maintain such borrowings as of the close of
business on October 31, 2016 (“ Other Members
”).

 

The
Company may offer Shares (as hereinafter defined), if any,
remaining after the Subscription Offering in a community offering
to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus
(as hereinafter defined) is delivered (the “ Community
Offering ”) with a preference to natural persons and
trusts of natural persons residing in Noble, Monroe and

 

 

 


 

 

Washington
Counties, Ohio. In the event a Community Offering is held, it may
be held at any time during or promptly after the Subscription
Offering. Depending on market conditions, Shares available for sale
but not subscribed for in the Subscription Offering or purchased in
the Community Offering may, at the request of the Company, be
offered to certain members of the general public on a best efforts
basis through a selected dealers agreement (the “
Syndicated Community Offering ”) as described
in subsection 4(a)(iii) below. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company is
offering a minimum of 391,000 shares and a maximum of 529,000
shares (subject to an increase up to 608,350 shares) of Common
Stock (the “ Shares ”), in the
Subscription Offering, and, if necessary, in the Community Offering
and/or the Syndicated Community Offering (collectively, the “
Offering ”). Upon completion of the Offering,
pursuant to the Plan 100% of the outstanding common stock of the
Bank will be held by the Company. The Company will sell the Shares
in the Offering at $10.00 per share (the “ Purchase
Price ”). If the number of Shares offered is
increased or decreased in accordance with the Plan, the term
“Shares” shall mean such greater or lesser number, as
applicable.

 

The
Company has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “ Commission ” or the “
SEC ”) a Registration Statement on Form S-1
(File No. 333-213561) in order to register the Shares under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ 1933
Act ”), and has filed such amendments thereto as have
been required to the date hereof (the “ Registration
Statement ”). The prospectus, as amended, included in
the Registration Statement at the time it initially became
effective is hereinafter called the “
Prospectus ,” except that if any prospectus is
filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules
and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the “
1933 Act Regulations ”) differing from the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time it
initially becomes effective, the term “Prospectus”
shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c)
from and after the time such prospectus is filed with the
Commission and shall include any supplements and amendments thereto
from and after their dates of effectiveness or use,
respectively.

 

In
connection with the Conversion, the Bank filed with the OCC an
Application for Conversion on Form AC (together with any other
required ancillary applications and/or notices, the “
Conversion Application ”). The Company has
filed with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the
“ Federal Reserve ”) an application on
Form H-(e)1 (the “ Holding Company Application
”) to become a savings and loan holding company under the
Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended (the “
HOLA ”), and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. Collectively, the Conversion Application and the
Holding Company Application are referred to as the “
Applications .”

 

Section 2.
Retention of Agent . Subject
to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the CS Parties hereby
appoint the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and
marketing agent to utilize its best efforts to solicit
subscriptions for the Shares and to advise and assist the CS
Parties with respect to the Company’s sale of the Shares in
the Offering.

 

On the
basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein
contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set
forth, the Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult
with and advise the CS Parties as to the matters set forth in
(i) the letter agreement, dated July 27, 2016, between the
Bank and KBW (the “ Engagement Letter ”)
and (ii)

the
matters set forth in the letter agreement, dated July 27, 2016,
regarding Services of Conversion Agent and Data Processing Records
Management Agent, between the Bank and KBW (the “
Conversion Agent Engagement Letter ” and,
together with the Engagement Letters, the “ Engagement
Letters ”). It is acknowledged by the CS Parties that
the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares or be
obligated to take any action that is inconsistent with all
applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.

 

Except as
described in Section 14 of this Agreement, the obligations of the
Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier
of (i) the completion, termination or abandonment of the Plan by
the CS Parties, (ii) the termination of the Offering and (iii) 45
days after the completion of the Subscription Offering (the “
End Date ”). All fees or expenses due to the
Agent hereunder but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day
funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined)
or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the
End Date, the CS Parties and the Agent may agree to renew this
Agreement under mutually acceptable terms and subject to the
approval of any governmental agency having jurisdiction over such
matters.

 

In the
event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of 391,000 Shares by
the End Date, this Agreement shall terminate and the Company shall
refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the
full amount that it may have received from them plus accrued
interest, as set forth in the Prospectus, and none of the parties
to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties
hereunder, except as set forth in Sections 4(a), 10, 12, 13 and 14
hereof, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 

Section 3.
Sale and Delivery of Shares . If all
conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion,
including, without limitation, the sale of all Shares required by
the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Company agrees to issue, or
have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release for
delivery statement of ownership for such Shares on the Closing Date
(as hereinafter defined) against payment to the Company by any
means authorized by the Plan; provided, however, that no funds
shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in
Section 11 hereof shall have been complied with to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel. The release
of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a
place mutually acceptable to the CS Parties and the Agent.
Statements of ownership for Shares shall be delivered directly to
the purchasers in accordance with their directions. The date upon
which the Company shall release or deliver the Shares sold in the
Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the
“ Closing Date .”

 

Section 4.
Compensation . (a) The
Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services
hereunder:

 

(i)          A
non-refundable cash fee in the amount of $30,000 (the “
Management Fee ”), all of which has been earned
in full and paid prior to the date hereof.

 

(ii)         A
non-refundable cash fee in the amount of $250,000 (the “
Success Fee ”), which shall be paid upon the
completion of the Subscription Offering and the Community Offering.
For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to pay to KBW the full
Success Fee upon completion of the Subscription Offering and any
Community Offering shall survive

any
termination of this Agreement, including any termination occurring
prior to the completion of such offerings. The Management Fee shall
be credited against the Success Fee.

 

(iii)        If
any Shares remain unsold after the completion of the Subscription
Offering and any Community Offering, at the request of the Company,
KBW will seek to form a syndicate of registered broker-dealers
(“ Selected Dealers ”) to assist in a
Syndicated Community Offering, on a best efforts basis, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in a selected dealers agreement
to be entered into by and among KBW and the Selected Dealers under
the terms set forth as Exhibit A, with such changes thereto as
agreed to by KBW and the Selected Dealers. KBW will endeavor to
distribute the Common Stock among the Selected Dealers in a fashion
which best meets the distribution objectives of the Company and the
Conversion. In the event of a Syndicated Community Offering, KBW
will be paid a transaction fee equal to 6.0% of the aggregate
purchase price of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Syndicated
Community Offering (the “ Transaction Fee
”). The Success Fee will be credited against the Transaction
Fee. From the Transaction Fee, KBW will pass onto the Selected
Dealers, if any, who assist in the Syndicated Community Offering an
amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at
such time for comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable
price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect
to purchases effected with the assistance of a Selected Dealer
other than KBW shall be transmitted by KBW to such Selected
Dealer.

 

(iv)        In
connection with the Subscription Offering, if, as a result of any
resolicitation of subscribers undertaken by the Company, KBW
reasonably determines that it is required or requested to provide
significant services, KBW will be entitled to additional
compensation for such services in an amount mutually agreed by KBW
and the Company, which additional compensation will not exceed
$25,000.

 

(v)         A
non-refundable cash fee in the amount of $30,000 (the “
Services Fee ” and, together with the
Management Fee, Success Fee and Transaction Fee, the “
Offering Fees ”), $5,000 of which has been
earned in full and paid prior to the date hereof, in connection
with KBW’s provision of services as conversion agent and data
processing records management agent pursuant to the Conversion
Agent Engagement Letter. The balance of the Services Fee shall be
due and payable immediately upon the completion of the
Offering.

 

(b)          KBW
shall be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, not
to exceed $30,000 (subject to the provisions of this paragraph),
related to the Offering, including, but not limited to, costs of
travel, meals and lodging, clerical assistance, photocopying,
telephone, facsimile and couriers. KBW will also be reimbursed for
fees and expenses of its counsel not to exceed $75,000 (subject to
the provisions of this paragraph). These expense caps assume no
unusual circumstances or delays, and no resolicitation in
connection with the Offering. The CS Parties acknowledge and agree
that, in the event unusual circumstances arise or resolicitation
occurs (including but not limited to a delay in the Offering that
would require an update of the financial information in tabular
form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original
filing of the offering documents), such expense caps may be
increased by additional amounts,

not to
exceed an additional $10,000 in the case of additional
out-of-pocket expenses of KBW and an additional $15,000 in the case
of additional fees and expenses of KBW’s legal counsel. In no
event shall out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and expenses of
counsel, exceed $130,000. The provisions of this paragraph shall
not apply to or in any way impair the indemnification, contribution
or liability limitation provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(c)          KBW
shall be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the services provided pursuant to the
Conversion Agent Engagement Letter, regardless of whether the
Offering is consummated, provided that such out-of-pocket expenses
shall not exceed $5,000. Not later than two days before the closing
of the Offering, KBW will provide the Company with documentation of
all reimbursable expenses of KBW, to be paid at closing. The
provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to or in any way
impair the indemnification, contribution or liability limitation
provisions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 5.
Closing . The
closing for the sale of the Shares shall take place on the Closing
Date at such location as mutually agreed upon by the Agent and the
CS Parties. At the closing, the CS Parties shall deliver to the
Agent in next day funds the commissions, fees and expenses due and
owing to the Agent as set forth in Sections 4 and 10 hereof and the
opinions and certificates required hereby and other documents
deemed reasonably necessary by the Agent shall be executed and
delivered to effect the sale of the Shares as contemplated hereby
and pursuant to the terms set forth in the Prospectus.

 

Section
6. Representations and Warranties of the CS Parties
.

 

The CS
Parties jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Agent
that:

 

(a)          Each
of the CS Parties has all such power, authority, authorizations,
approvals and orders as may be required to enter into this
Agreement, and, as of the Closing Date, each of the CS Parties will
have all such power, authority, authorizations, approvals and
orders as may be required to carry out the provisions and
conditions hereof and to issue and sell the Shares to be sold by
the Company as provided herein and as described in the Prospectus.
The consummation of the Conversion, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Engagement Letters and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been, or
will be as of the Closing Date, duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of each of the CS Parties.
This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by each of
the CS Parties, and is a valid, legal and binding obligation of
each of the CS Parties, in each case enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as the legality, validity, binding nature and
enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, conservatorship,
receivership or other similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, or the rights of
creditors of insured financial institutions and their holding
companies, (ii) general equity principles regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law, and (iii) the extent, if any, that the provisions of Sections
12 or 13 hereof may be unenforceable as against public
policy.

 

(b)          The
Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission on
November 14, 2016. No stop order has been issued with respect to
the Prospectus. No

proceedings
related to the Prospectus have been initiated or, to the knowledge
of the CS Parties, threatened by the Commission. At the time the
Registration Statement, including the Prospectus contained therein
(including any amendment or supplement thereto), became effective,
the Registration Statement complied as to form in all material
respects with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations, and the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus did not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. At the time any Rule 424(b) or (c) Prospectus is
filed with the Commission and at the Closing Date, the Registration
Statement, including the Prospectus (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) and, when taken together with the Prospectus,
any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information (as such terms are
defined in Section 12 hereof) authorized by any of the CS Parties
for use in connection with the Offering, will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties in this Section 6(b) shall not apply to statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the CS Parties by the Agent expressly
regarding the Agent or its counsel for use in the Prospectus; for
purposes of this Agreement, the only information so furnished shall
be the information in the last sentence of the first paragraph
under the caption “Market for the Common Stock” in the
Prospectus (the “ Agent Information
”).

 

(c)          Any
statistical and market related data contained in any Permitted Free
Writing Prospectus (as hereinafter defined), the Prospectus and the
Registration Statement are based on or derived from sources which
the CS Parties believe are reliable and accurate. No
forward-looking statement (within the meaning of Section 27A of the
1933 Act and Section 21E of the 1934 Act) or statement of belief
contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any
Permitted Free Writing Prospectus has been made or reaffirmed
without a reasonable basis or has been disclosed other than in good
faith.

 

(d)          Neither
the Company nor the Bank has directly or indirectly distributed or
otherwise used, and will not, without the prior consent of the
Agent, directly or indirectly distribute or otherwise use, any
prospectus, any “free writing prospectus” (as defined
in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations) or other offering material
(including, without limitation, content on the Company’s or
the Bank’s website that may be deemed to be a prospectus,
free writing prospectus or other offering material) in connection
with the Offering and the sale of the Shares.

 

(e)          The
Company is not an “ineligible issuer” (as defined in
Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations) as of the eligibility
determination date for purposes of Rules 164 and 433 of the 1933
Act Regulations with respect to the Offering or otherwise precluded
under Rule 164 from using free writing prospectuses in connection
with the Offering. At the time of the filing of the Registration
Statement and at the time of the use of any issuer free writing
prospectus, as defined in Rule 433(h), the Company met the
conditions required by Rules 164 and 433 for the use of a free
writing prospectus (without reliance on subsections (b), (c) and
(d) for Rule 164). If required to be filed, the Company has filed
any issuer free writing prospectus related to the offered Shares at
the time it is required to be filed under Rule 433 and, if not
required to be filed, will retain such free writing prospectus in
the Company’s records pursuant to Rule 433(g) and
if

any issuer
free writing prospectus is used after the date hereof in connection
with the offering of the Shares the Company will file or retain
such free writing prospectus as required by Rule 433.

 

(f)          As
of each Applicable Time (as defined below), neither (x) the Issuer
General Free Writing Prospectus(es) issued at or prior to such
Applicable Time and the Statutory Prospectus, all considered
together (collectively, the “ General Disclosure
Package ”), nor (y) any individual Issuer Limited-Use
Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General
Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence
does not apply to statements in or omissions from any Prospectus

Rule 433(g) under the 1933 Act Regulations. The term does not
include any writing exempted from the definition of prospectus

Regulations, that is made available without restriction pursuant to

free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act
Regulations that is consented to by the CS Parties and the

does not and will not include any information that conflicted,
conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the
Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by

Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a
result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or
would conflict with the information contained in the Registration
Statement relating to the offered Shares or included or would
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at
that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company has notified or
will notify promptly the Agent so that any use of such Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus may cease until it is amended or supplemented
and the Company has promptly amended or will promptly amend or

written information furnished to the Company by the Agent
specifically for use therein.

November 9, 2016 and at all times subsequent thereto until the
Closing Date, the Conversion Application, including the Prospectus
and the Proxy Statement (including any amendment or supplement
thereto), will comply in all material respects with the Conversion
Regulations, except to the extent waived in writing by the OCC. The
Conversion Application, including the Prospectus and the Proxy
Statement (including any amendment or supplement thereto), does not
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the
representations and warranties in this Section 6(h) shall not apply
to statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity
with the Agent Information.

the Bank in material conformity with the requirements of the
Federal Reserve and approved by the Federal Reserve. A conformed
copy of the Holding Company Application has been delivered to the
Agent and its counsel, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by
the Agent.

suspending the use of the Prospectus or any supplemental sales
literature authorized by the CS Parties for use in connection with
the Offering, and no action by or before any such government entity
to revoke any approval, authorization or order of effectiveness
related to the Conversion is pending or, to the knowledge of the CS
Parties, threatened.

 

(k)          Pursuant
to the Conversion Regulations, the Plan has been, or prior to the

Shares
will have been conducted in all material respects in accordance
with the Plan, the Conversion Regulations, and all other applicable
laws, regulations, decisions and orders, including all terms,
conditions, requirements and provisions precedent to the Conversion
imposed upon the Bank by the OCC, the Commission or any other
regulatory authority, other than those which the regulatory
authority permits to be completed after the Conversion, and in the
manner described in the Prospectus. To the knowledge of the CS
Parties, no person has sought to obtain review of the final action
of the OCC in approving the Plan, the Conversion Application or the

financial statements, schedules and notes related thereto that are
included in the Prospectus fairly present in all material respects
the financial condition, results of operations, changes in equity
and cash flows of the Bank at the respective dates indicated and
for the respective periods covered thereby and comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X of
the SEC and United States generally accepted accounting principles
(“ GAAP ”) (including those requiring the
recording of certain assets at their current market value). Such
financial statements, schedules and notes related thereto have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout
the periods involved (except as noted in the notes to the financial
statements), present fairly in all material respects the
information required to be stated therein and are consistent with
the most recent financial statements and other reports filed by the
Bank with the OCC, and any other applicable regulatory authority,
except that accounting principles employed in such regulatory
filings conform to the requirements of such authorities and not
necessarily to GAAP. The other financial, statistical and pro forma
information and related notes included in the Prospectus present
fairly the information shown therein on a basis consistent with the
audited and unaudited financial statements of the Bank included in
the Prospectus, and as to the pro forma adjustments, the
adjustments made therein have been properly compiled and
consistently applied on the basis described therein and the
assumptions used in the preparation thereof are reasonable and the
adjustments made therein are appropriate to give effect to the
transactions and circumstances therein.

 

(o)          Since
the respective dates as of which information is given in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except as may otherwise
be stated therein: (i) there has not been

any
material adverse change in the financial condition, results of
operations, capital, assets, properties, business affairs or
prospects of the CS Parties, taken as a whole, whether or not
arising in the ordinary course of business; (ii) there has not been
any material increase in the long-term debt of the Bank or in the
principal amount of the Bank’s assets that are classified by
the Bank as substandard, doubtful or loss or in loans past due 90
days or more or real estate acquired by foreclosure, by
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or deemed in-substance foreclosure or
any material decrease in equity capital or total assets of the
Bank, nor have the CS Parties issued any securities (other than in
connection with the incorporation of the Company) or incurred any
liability or obligation for borrowing other than in the ordinary
course of business in amounts consistent with past periods; (iii)
there have not been any material transactions entered into by the
CS Parties that have not been disclosed in the Prospectus; (iv)
there has not been any material adverse change in the aggregate
dollar amount of the Bank’s deposits or its consolidated net
worth; (v) there has been no material adverse change in the CS
Parties’ relationship with their insurance carriers,
including, without limitation, cancellation or other termination of
the CS Parties fidelity bond or any other type of insurance
coverage; (vi) there has been no material change in executive
management of any of the CS Parties; (vii) none of the CS Parties
has sustained any material loss or interference with its respective
business or properties from fire, flood, windstorm, earthquake,
accident or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance;
(viii) none of the CS Parties is in default in the payment of
principal or interest on any outstanding debt obligations; (ix) the
capitalization, liabilities, assets, properties and business of the
CS Parties conform in all material respects to the descriptions
thereof contained in the Prospectus; (x) none of the CS Parties has
any material contingent or other liabilities, except as set forth
in the Prospectus; and (xi) there has been no dividend or
distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the CS
Parties.

 

(p)          At
the Closing Date, the Company will be a stock corporation duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of Maryland, with
corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct
its business, as described in the Prospectus, and will be qualified
to transact business and will be in good standing in Ohio and in
each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of business requires
such qualification, unless the failure to qualify in one or more of
such jurisdictions would not have a material adverse effect on the
conduct of the business, financial condition, results of
operations, capital, properties, business affairs or prospects of
the CS Parties taken as a whole (a “ Material Adverse
Effect ”). On the Closing Date, the Company will have
obtained all licenses, permits and other governmental
authorizations then required for the conduct of its business,
except those that individually or in the aggregate would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and as of
the Closing Date, all such licenses, permits and governmental
authorizations will be in full force and effect, and the Company
will be in compliance therewith in all material respects, and the
Company will be in compliance in all material respects with all
laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to the operation of
its business. The Company does not own equity securities or any
equity interest in any other business enterprise except the
Bank.

 

(q)          The
Bank maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management’s general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
and to maintain accountability for assets,

 

 




 



10



 




  

  

(iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accounts or assets are compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect
to any differences.

 

(r)          The
books, records and accounts and systems of internal accounting
control of the Bank comply in all material respects with the
requirements of Section 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “ 1934 Act ”). As
of the Closing Date, the Company will establish and maintain
“disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) that are
effective in ensuring that the information it will be required to
disclose in the reports it files or submits under the 1934 Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management
(including the Company’s chief executive officer and chief
financial officer) in a timely manner and recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms under the 1934 Act. To the knowledge of
the Bank, Suttle & Stalnaker PLLC and the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors have been advised of: (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which could
adversely affect the Bank’s ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial data; and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Bank’s internal
accounting controls. Since the date of the most recent evaluation
of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no
changes in internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Bank’s internal control over financial
reporting.

 

(s)          Each
of the CS Parties carries, or is covered by, insurance in such
amounts and covering such risks as are prudent and customary in the
business in which they are engaged, and all policies of insurance
insuring the Company or the Bank are in full force and effect. Each
CS Party is in compliance with the terms of such insurance policies
and instruments in all material respects and there are no claims by
any of them under any such policy or instrument as to which any
insurance company is denying liability or defending under a
reservation of rights clause. No CS Party has been refused any
insurance coverage sought or applied for, nor has any reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance
coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar
coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its
business.

 

(t)          The
Bank has been duly organized and is a validly existing federally
chartered savings bank in the mutual form of organization and upon
the Conversion will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, in both instances duly authorized to conduct its business
and own its property as described in the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus. The Bank has obtained all licenses, permits and
other governmental authorizations currently required for the
conduct of its business, except those that individually or in the
aggregate would not be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, all such licenses, permits and governmental
authorizations are in full force and effect, and the Bank is in
compliance with all laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable
to the operation of its business, except where failure to be in
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as described
in the Prospectus, the Bank does not own equity securities or any
equity interest in any other active business enterprise except the
Federal

Home Loan
Bank of Cincinnati (the “ FHLB-Cincinnati
”) or as would not be material to the operations of the Bank.
The Bank is a “qualified thrift lender” within the
meaning of 12 U.S.C. § 1467a (m). Upon completion of the
Conversion, (i) all of the authorized and outstanding capital stock
of the Bank will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and owned by the Company free and clear of any
mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or restriction of any
kind and (ii) the Company will have no direct subsidiaries other
than the Bank. At the Closing Date, the Conversion will have been
effected in all material respects in accordance with all applicable
statutes, regulations, decisions and orders; and, except with
respect to the filing of certain post-sale, post-Conversion
reports, and the Conversion Regulations or letters or orders of
approval, all terms, conditions, requirements and provisions with
respect to the Conversion imposed by the OCC or any other
governmental agency, if any, will have been complied with by the CS
Parties in all material respects or appropriate waivers will have
been obtained and all material notice and waiting periods will have
been satisfied, waived or elapsed.

 

(u)          Except
as described in the Prospectus, there are no encumbrances or
restrictions or requirements or material legal restrictions or
requirements required to be described therein, on the ability of
the Company or the Bank (i) to pay dividends or make any other
distributions on its capital stock or to pay any indebtedness owed
to another party, (ii) to make any loans or advances to, or
investments in, another party or (iii) to transfer any of its
property or assets to another party.

 

(v)         The
Bank has properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for which it
serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the
terms of the governing documents and applicable state and federal
law and regulation, except where the failure to do so would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Bank, nor any of its directors, officers or employees has committed
any material breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary
account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are
true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect
the assets of such fiduciary account in all material
respects.

 

(w)         Upon
completion of the Conversion, the authorized capital stock of the
Bank will consist of 7,000,000 shares of common stock, of $0.01 par
value per share (the “ Bank Common Stock
”) and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of $0.01 par
value per share (the “ Bank Preferred Stock
”), of which 100 shares of Bank Common Stock and no shares of
Bank Preferred Stock will be issued and outstanding immediately
following the Conversion; no additional shares of Bank Common Stock
will be issued upon completion of the Conversion.

 

(x)          The
Bank is a member of the FHLB-Cincinnati. The deposit accounts of
the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“ FDIC ”) up to the maximum limits, and
no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such insurance
are pending or, to the knowledge of the CS Parties,
threatened.

 

(y)          Upon
consummation of the Conversion, the authorized, issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company will be within the range
set forth in the Prospectus under the caption
“Capitalization” and no shares of Common Stock have
been or will be issued and

outstanding
prior to the Closing Date (except for the shares issued upon
incorporation of the Company); the Shares have been duly and
validly authorized for issuance and, when issued and delivered by
the Company pursuant to the Plan against payment of the
consideration calculated as set forth in the Plan and the
Prospectus, will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and
nonassessable and owned free and clear of any security interest,
mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or legal or equitable claim.
Upon consummation of the Conversion, there will be no outstanding
warrants or options to purchase any securities of the Company. The
Shares will have been issued in compliance with federal and state
securities laws and conform in all material respects to the
description of the Shares contained in the Prospectus. The issuance
of the Shares is not subject to preemptive rights, except for the
subscription rights granted pursuant to the Plan. The terms and
provisions of the Shares will conform in all material respects to
the description thereof contained in the Prospectus. Upon issuance
of the Shares, good title to the Shares will be transferred from
the Company to the purchasers of Shares against payment therefor as
set forth in the Plan and the Prospectus, subject to such claims as
may be asserted against the purchasers thereof by third party
claimants.

 

(z)          None
of the CS Parties is or at the Closing Date will be (i) in
violation of their respective charters or bylaws, as applicable or
(ii) in default in the performance or observance of any obligation,
agreement, covenant, or condition contained in any contract, lease,
loan agreement, indenture or other instrument to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its property may be bound that would
be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions herein contemplated will not: (i) violate or
conflict with the charter or bylaws or other governing documents of
any of the CS Parties; (ii) conflict with, or constitute a breach
of or default under, any material contract, lease or other
instrument to which any of the CS Parties is a party or by which
any of the properties of the CS Parties may be bound, or any
applicable law, rule, regulation or order, except for such
violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults that would not
individually or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) violate any authorization, approval, judgment,
decree, order, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the CS
Parties, except for such violations which would not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (iv) result in the
creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property of
the CS Parties, except for such liens, charges or encumbrances that
would not individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(aa)        All
documents made available to or delivered or to be made available to
or delivered by the CS Parties or their representatives in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares, including
records of account holders, and depositors of the Bank, or in
connection with the Agent’s exercise of due diligence, except
for those documents which were prepared by parties other than the
CF Parties or their representatives, to the knowledge of the CS
Parties, were on the dates on which they were delivered, or will be
on the dates on which they are to be delivered, true, complete and
correct in all material respects.

 

(bb)        No
default exists, and no event has occurred which with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default on the part of
any of the CS Parties, in the due performance and observance of any
term, covenant or condition of any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, note, bank loan or credit agreement or any other instrument
or agreement to which any of the CS

Parties is
a party or by which any of their property is bound or affected in
any respect which, in any such case, would be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, and such agreements are in full
force and effect; and no other party to any such agreement has
instituted or, to the knowledge of any of the CS Parties,
threatened any action or proceeding wherein any of the CS Parties
is alleged to be in default thereunder under circumstances where
such action or proceeding, if determined adversely to any of the CS
Parties, would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(cc)        The
CS Parties have good and marketable title to all real property and
good title to all other assets which are material to the businesses
of the CS Parties, free and clear of all liens, charges,
encumbrances, restrictions or other claims, except such as are
described in the Prospectus, the pledging of assets to secure
advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati, or where the absence of good and
marketable title, or good title, as the case may be, or the
existence of such liens, charges, encumbrances, restrictions or
other claims would not be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and all of the leases and subleases which are
material to the businesses of the CS Parties, taken as a whole,
including those described in the Registration Statement or
Prospectus, are in full force and effect.

 

(dd)        The
CS Parties are not in violation of any directive from the OCC, or
any other agency, to make any material change in the method of
conducting their respective businesses so as to comply in all
material respects with all applicable statutes and regulations
(including, without limitation, regulations, decisions, directives
and orders of the OCC); the CS Parties have conducted and are
conducting their respective businesses so as to comply in all
respects with all applicable statutes and regulations (including,
without limitation, regulations, decisions, directives and orders
of the Commission and the OCC), except where the failure to so
comply would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and there is no charge, investigation, action, suit or
proceeding before or by any court, regulatory authority or
governmental agency or body pending or, to the knowledge of any of
the CS Parties, threatened, which might materially and adversely
affect the Conversion, the performance of this Agreement, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Plan as
described in the Registration Statement, or which might be
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(ee)        Prior
to the Closing Date, the CS Parties will have received opinions of
their special counsel, Luse Gorman, PC, with respect to the federal
income tax consequences of the Conversion and an opinion from
Suttle & Stalnaker PLLC with respect to the Ohio income tax
consequences of the Conversion; all material aspects of the
opinions of Luse Gorman, PC and Suttle & Stalnaker PLLC are
accurately summarized in the Registration Statement and Prospectus,
and the facts upon which such opinions are based are truthful,
accurate and complete, and none of the CS Parties will
intentionally take any action inconsistent therewith.

 

(ff)         The
CS Parties have filed all required federal and state tax returns,
paid all taxes that have become due and payable, except where
permitted to be extended or where the failure to pay such taxes
would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and made adequate reserves for similar future tax liabilities to
the extent required by GAAP, and no deficiency has been asserted
with respect thereto by any taxing authority. There are no transfer
taxes or other similar fees or charges under Federal law or the
laws of any state, or any political subdivision thereof, required
to be paid in connection with the execution and delivery of
this

Agreement
by the CS Parties or with the issuance or sale by the Company of
the Shares.

 

(gg)        No
approval, authorization, consent or other order of any regulatory
or supervisory or other public authority is required for the

issuance of the Shares, except for the approval of the Federal
Reserve, the OCC and the Commission, such approvals as may be
required under the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory

(hh)        None

and agency and other securities in the ordinary course of business;
or (iii) engaged any intermediary between the Agent and the CS
Parties in connection with the Offering or the offering of shares
of the Common Stock of the Company, and no person is being
compensated in any manner for such services. Appropriate
arrangements have been made for placing the funds received from
subscriptions for Shares in a special interest-bearing account with
the Bank until all Shares are sold and paid for, with provision for
refund to the purchasers in the event that the Conversion is not
completed for whatever reason or for delivery to the Company if all
Shares are sold.

 

(ii)         To
the knowledge of the CS Parties, the CS Parties have not made any

there is no charge, investigation, action, suit or proceedings
before any governmental authority pending or, to the knowledge of
the Bank, threatened regarding the Bank’s compliance with the
USA PATRIOT Act or any regulations promulgated
hereunder.
