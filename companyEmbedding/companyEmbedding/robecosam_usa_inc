What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]
The table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]
The table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.

In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]
The table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

PRI, Principles for Responsible Investment[43]
Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]
It was founded under the belief that individuals who place a great importance and effort to promote sustainability in the workplace should be publicly recognized.[48]

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

Companies





A record number of companies participated in RobecoSAM’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Out of more than 3,400 companies that were invited, 867 companies from 42 different countries participated, which we believe is a positive development in corporate sustainability. For investors, the Sustainability Yearbook identifies companies that are strongly positioned to create long-term shareholder value.
Our annual Corporate Sustainability Assessment focuses on examining financially material factors that impact a company’s value drivers. Factors such as a company’s ability to innovate, attract and retain talent or enhance its operational eco-efficiency matter from an investor’s point of view because they impact a company’s competitive position and long-term financial performance.

                            Initiated in 1999, our Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) is an annual assessment of companies’ sustainability practices. Our approach is unique in that it is based on information provided by the companies directly through the online questionnaire. Based on a rigorous and rules-based methodology, the CSA forms the research backbone of the globally recognized Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

 

We also use the insights derived from the CSA in our entire range of asset management products and services. Our Sustainability Services offering allows companies, experts and practitioners to evaluate their sustainability performance against that of their peers.
