Method of inhibiting sulfate scale in aqueous systems using poly(amino acids)



Patent number:  5658464
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention provides a method for inhibiting the formation of metal sulfate scale in an aqueous system. Metal sulfate scale formation is inhibited by adding an effective amount of one or more poly(amino acids) and one or more inorganic phosphates to the aqueous system. The poly(amino acids) are a reaction product formed from at least one compound selected from amino acids, amic acids, ammonium salts of monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, and ammonium salts of hydroxypolycarboxylic acids. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting the formation of metal sulfate scale by adding an effective amount of a poly(amino acid) which contains tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, arginine or combinations thereof.
