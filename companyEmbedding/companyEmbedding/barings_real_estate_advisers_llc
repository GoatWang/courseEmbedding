General Risk Factors
Investment involves risks. The value of investments and any income generated may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed.  Past performance is not a guide to future performance
•    The initial charges (such as broker’s charges and stamp duty) will have an impact on the value of an investor's holding, particularly in the short term.
•    Investors should regard their holdings as a long term investment.
•    Shares in the Company have been admitted to the Official List and are traded on the London Stock Exchange's market for listed securities. Accordingly, shares are purchased by investors through the stock market and therefore investors will not be able to cancel their purchase. However, in respect of investments made within an Individual Savings Account (ISA) investors will have a 7 day period in which they can change their mind.
•    Due to their fixed capital structure, investment trusts are able to borrow to raise further funds which can be used to buy additional securities for their portfolio, when the manager of the investment trust and its board of directors consider that it may be commercially advantageous for the investment trust to do so. This is generally described as 'gearing'. An investment trust which has purchased additional assets as a result of gearing may have a more volatile share price than one which does not, since gearing can increase shareholder returns in rising markets but conversely can increase the extent to which the value of the funds attributable to shareholders decreases in falling markets.
•    Changes in rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of an investment.
•    Investors should be aware of the additional risks arising from companies trading on or investing in stock markets of emerging or developing countries where price volatility may be greater, and the ability of the investment trust to buy and sell its portfolio easily and without influencing its price (commonly known as the 'liquidity' of the market) may be lower, than those experienced in more developed economies and stock markets. There is also a risk associated with different settlement and custody practices.
•    Where the income earned by an investment trust is insufficient to cover charges and expenses, the balances will be charged to capital, which may constrain capital growth.
•    Investors should be aware that the Company has warrants in issue. A warrant is a time–limited right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities and is exercisable against the original issuer of the underlying securities. A relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavourable or favourable, in the price of the warrant. The prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. It is essential that investors wishing to purchase warrants understand that the right to subscribe which a warrant confers is invariably limited in time with the consequence that if the investor fails to exercise this right within the predetermined time–scale then the investment becomes worthless. You should not buy a warrant unless you are prepared to sustain a total loss of the money you have invested plus any commission or other transaction charges.
The information on this site does not constitute investment, tax, legal or other advice or recommendation or, an offer to sell or an invitation to buy shares or warrants in the Company.

Investment in a Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program for any investor. An investment should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment.

Unified firm will operate under the Barings brand with offices in 20 countries
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (March 9, 2016) – Babson Capital Management LLC, its subsidiaries Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC and Wood Creek Capital Management, LLC, and Baring Asset Management Limited, announced today their intention to combine and use the Barings brand. The combination creates a leading global, multi-asset investment management firm with over $260 billion of assets under management, offices in 20 countries, and over 1,700 professionals. The firm will be led by Tom Finke, current Chairman and CEO of Babson, and will be headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.
David Brennan, Chairman and CEO of Barings, who will retire as planned during the summer of 2016, commented, “This is an exciting opportunity for the Barings organization to combine with its affiliates to create a new, more diversified global manager.” Brennan added, “It has been an honor leading this impressive organization over the past 14 years, and I look forward to working with the new management team in the coming months.”
Because of the complementary nature of the firms’ investment capabilities in fixed income, equity, multi-asset, real estate, real assets, and alternatives, no change in investment leadership is anticipated. Furthermore, distribution and marketing capabilities will be combined together to support the new global firm.
“This combination is highly complementary in terms of asset classes, distribution footprint, and shared commitment to excellence,” said Tom Finke. “Together, Babson, Barings, Cornerstone, and Wood Creek offer institutional and retail investors worldwide a compelling array of investment offerings. As a unified firm we will be better able to deliver our diverse and global investment offerings to clients.”
As a result of the combination, the Barings brand and logo will be refreshed to reflect the global nature of the new Barings and signify the unified platform of the affiliates. The choice to retain the Barings brand reinforces the global aspect of the new firm, the diversified nature of its client base, and the Barings heritage which dates back to 1762.
Babson, Barings, Cornerstone, and Wood Creek are affiliates of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual), a leading mutual life insurance company. Roger Crandall, the Chairman, President, and CEO of MassMutual, commented, “By bringing together these highly complementary world-class affiliates under the iconic and respected Barings brand, MassMutual enhances its already-strong offering of investment capabilities and outstanding service to an expanded universe of clients around the globe. We appreciate David’s commitment to help ensure a smooth and seamless process, as well as his outstanding leadership during his 14 years as Chairman and CEO of Barings, and welcome Tom into his new leadership role in the unified firm. I have tremendous confidence in this management team to both successfully implement this important initiative and build on the tremendous success already achieved.”
The firm expects to close the initial phase of the integration during the fourth quarter of this year, subject to required regulatory approval.
