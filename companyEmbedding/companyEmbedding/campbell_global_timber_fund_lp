US softwood lumber imports from offshore markets increase considerably in 2017Q1. Western hemlock prices in Oregon have entered their seasonal improvement phase. Changes taking place in the log supply chain within China could pose a threat to New Zealand logs.
            




April 2017

                US lumber prices are soaring, reaching levels last seen more than a decade ago. Canadian softwood lumber exports to the US assessed a preliminary countervailing duty rate of 19.88 percent.

February 2017

                Douglas-fir log prices in western Oregon are slowly increasing as the gradual recovery in US housing markets continues. Strong demand in China in 2016H2 resulted in record imports of softwood lumber and logs. US inventory of existing homes for sale continued to decline in 2016, reaching levels last seen more than two decades ago. Wood fiber costs for Eastern Canada pulp mills the lowest in ten years.
            




January 2017

                US softwood log exports globally are expected to further decline in 2016, despite an increase in exports to China year-over-year. Canadian lumber exports to the US have increased by 20 percent on average in the year following the expiration of the SLA compared with the year prior. The spread between Douglas-fir domestic and export sawlog prices in the lower Columbia River region has vanished, with improving demand from China during 2016H2.

                The Global Sawlog Price Index rose 4.2 percent in 2016Q2.  Whitewood log prices in the Puget Sound region have rebounded from five-year lows.  Canadian lumber production in 2016H1 was eight percent ahead of the 2015 pace.  Homeownership in the US fell to 62.9 percent in 2016Q2, matching 1965 for the lowest reading on record.
            




August 2016

                SPF lumber prices continue to rise, reaching levels last seen in late 2014.

Portfolio Characteristics 



P/E Ratio
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/E is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s earnings per share. Negative P/E ratios are excluded from this calculation.

as of 26-Jul-2017



10.79




P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

as of 26-Jul-2017



1.65




Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

as of 30-Jun-2017



0.80




Standard Deviation (3y)
Standard deviation measures how dispersed returns are around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that returns are spread out over a larger range of values and thus, more volatile.

as of 30-Jun-2017



16.60%




Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 30-Jun-2017



2.46%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.54%




30 Day SEC Yield
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund. Negative 30-Day SEC Yield results when accrued expenses of the past 30 days exceed the income collected during the past 30 days.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.


Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

			Private Equity Timber Funds














					19-Oct-2009
				
By
					Mihai Ghiorghies


Investing in private equity timber funds is becoming more and more attractive to institutional investors given the good risk/reward characteristics of the asset class.  Although yearly fundraising figures have been volatile since 2003, in some years Timber Investment Management Organizations (TIMOs) have managed to attract significant investor commitments. The largest amount was raised in 2008 when four private equity timber funds closed at a total of $2.2 billion. The second largest amount of capital was raised in 2007 when another four private equity forestry vehicles raised $700 million.
The largest fund raised since 2003 is Brookfield Global Timber Fund I which closed in 2008 and received a total of $1.2 billion in commitments. The fund is managed by Brookfield Asset Management and represents 55% of the total amount of capital raised by private equity timber funds in 2008. Other notable private equity timber funds that have closed in the past six years include the $806 million Campbell Opportunity Timber Fund VI and the $375 million TimberVest Partners II, raised in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Currently there are three private equity timber funds in the market looking to raise a total of $600 million. The largest is Global Timberland Resources Fund, managed by RMK Timberland Group, which is looking to raise $500 million and will invest in timber across North America, South America, Europe and Asia.

The Real "Growth" Industry: Timber 101
You may want to branch into the incredibly uncomplicated business of timber.











                Dan Newman
            

                (TMFHelloNewman)



            
            Jan 14, 2013 at 7:55PM
            
            





Hiking through a forest may be the last thing you think about when it comes to investments. The woods are probably the place you go to for a break from the financial, and technologically driven, world. But then those green leaves shimmering in the sunlight start to remind you of money. And you wonder, perhaps, if the forest is the perfect place to invest after all. 
Is timber a good investment? Let's cut through the underbrush to find out.
Timber marketThere are a dizzying number of wood products, so let's take a view from the canopy to get a grasp on the market.

Source: UNECE Timber Committee, 70th session, October 2012.
Softwood, a majority of the wood consumed, is from conifers, such as pine trees. This type of wood is typically used for structural roles in construction. Hardwoods, such as oak trees, are consumed far less and are usually used for flooring, furniture, and the more finished aspects of housing. Wood, of course, also is used to make newsprint and paper. Measured in metric tons, U.S. newsprint consumption has fallen from 8 million metric tons in 2007 to just 4 million in 2011, while other U.S. paper consumption has fallen from 80 million metric tons to 65 million.





The metric most timber analysts keep their eye on is housing starts. More housing construction means more demand, and housing starts have started to rebound from their recessionary lows.

US Housing Starts data by YCharts.
And with housing trending up, timber stocks have followed.

WY Total Return Price data by YCharts.





Long-term global forecasts from the Campbell Group's "Timber Trends" newsletter, a great resource for following the timber industry, highlight Asia as the largest consumer of pulpwood fiber within five years, while Brazil, China, and Russia will produce the greatest share of new output. Currently, China imports 50% of its softwood from Canada and the United States. In addition, biomass as an energy source could drive growth for wood pellets and wood energy chips, especially in Asia.
The merits of biomass as a clean energy source are debated, especially versus coal, but as it is renewable, countries can use it to meet renewable-energy goals. For example, South Korea hopes to power 11.5% of its needs through renewable energy by 2030 from 4% in 2011 and use 5 million tons of pellets by 2020, versus "less than a few hundred thousand tons used in 2011."
What to look for in companiesIf things appear at least cyclically green for the timber industry, what should an investor look for in a company? 
Really, the same things in any good company: good management, prudent investments, and a healthy balance sheet. Good management will ensure that equipment will be kept up, that trees will be around to cut, and that there will be money to invest in new land, machinery, and labor. 





Specific to the timber industry, the basics include where a company owns land and the breakdown of its revenue from different sectors.
For example, Weyerhauser (NYSE:WY) owns nearly 2 million acres in Oregon and Washington, giving it easier access to the Chinese market. Potlatch (NASDAQ:PCH), meanwhile, has 800,000 acres in Idaho, making any potential trip for its logs to China a bit more costly.
Some companies, such as Pope Resources (NASDAQ:POPE), are more exposed to timber and real estate than the likes of Rayonier (NYSE:RYN), which earns more of its revenue from its "Performance Fibers" segment that it sells to manufacturers of a variety of goods, from diapers and paint to pharmaceuticals and digital displays.

In addition, many of the public timber companies are organized as REITs, a designation that gives the companies a special tax status and requires that they pay out at least 90% of earnings as dividends. As a result, dividend yields are usually attractive for the industry.
If you'd rather not bet on a single company, there are a few timber-based ETFs as well: iShares S&P Global Forestry and Timber Index Fund (NASDAQ:WOOD) and Claymore Beacon Global Timber Index (NYSEMKT:CUT). Since the market bottom in 2009, the iShares fund has beaten the S&P 500 by 20%, and the Claymore fund by 50%.
Nature conquers allTrees have grown for a long while on Earth, and they'll keep growing for longer than humans worry about financial portfolios. The business of timber is dead simple, and there are steady profits if a company does it right. If you're looking for a relatively safe resource asset, consider timber.

PKA AIP  –  Private funds















































 

















Private funds
Mandate · Portfolio






Mandate
New commitments are currently made out of PKA AIP 2 Private Funds – a DKK 13 billion (USD ~2 billion) program to be deployed in the three-year period from 2015 to 2017. The program includes both direct fund commitments and co-investments with managers, already in the PKA AIP programs.
It is the objective to generate a portfolio of commitments, which will make controllable and repeatable returns superior to those of the listed markets. To do this, we look for:

Mid-market buyout managers – typically with funds between USD 0.5-2.0 billion
Managers, who have a clearly articulated and documented strategic and operational approach to value creation
Independent managers with a single series of funds

The program will predominately be composed of private equity funds, but it will also include infrastructure and energy funds. The pursued infrastructure and energy funds are those that target a return similar to that of private equity buyout funds. Fund commitments are typically given in the range from USD 75-125 million, while co-investments are between USD 15-50 million.
PKA AIP 2 is a global program with the mandate to invest in all parts of the world. However, our strategic dedication to managers doing control investments has the geographical implication that most commitments will be to North American and European funds. We do expect though that PKA AIP 2 Private Funds, once fully invested, will include both global funds and one or more funds dedicated to regions outside of North America and Europe.
