Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

Made In The USA: American Consumers Can Bring Back 3 Million U.S. Manufacturing Jobs with Just Buying American Made, Says Author Richard Roedel
        																							
              

          In his new book The Polaris Effect, Roedel starts a movement to empower U.S. consumers to purchase American-made products

WENATCHEE, Wash., May 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In spite of reports of a rebounding U.S. economy, Americans are still rapidly losing manufacturing jobs to outsourcing. According to healthcare management executive Richard Roedel, an average of 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day between 2000-2012. However, Roedel has the solution, which he presents in a new book, The Polaris Effect. The book outlines what Americans can accomplish by changing their thinking and their buying habits.

                The Polaris Effect by Richard Roedel.  (PRNewsFoto/Richard Roedel)
              

 
 



The Polaris Effect: Who really holds the power in creating American Jobs? is more than just a book -- it's a movement to bring back three million U.S. manufacturing jobs. Rather than rely on the government or other companies, Roedel places the responsibility to bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs on U.S. citizens, whose wallets affect where manufacturing jobs are sent. 
"The Polaris Effect is a book I wrote to educate Americans on how they hold the power -- not the government or anyone else -- to create U.S. jobs. People don't realize that buying $3.30 of American made goods can actually create 10,000 jobs. I want to convince Americans how impactful their purchase decisions can be," says Roedel. 
Roedel has all the facts when it comes to manufacturing, but his personal experience with recession-related unemployment motivates him to share the message of The Polaris Effect.
In 2008 Roedel fell victim to the failing economy and lost his job as a real estate executive. At age 50 he decided to go back to school in order to gain the skills necessary to survive in the new economy. After the lengthy process of wading through many fruitless job interviews, Roedel finally landed a new career in healthcare.  But not before experiencing the anguish of outsourcing firsthand. 
Roedel knew it was his responsibility – not the government's – to find a new job. "Cities are filing for bankruptcy left and right. Look at Stockton, California! Most people look to our government for the answer but the government unfortunately does not have the solution. It's the public."
Disturbed by numerous American manufactures moving their manufacturing facilities to Mexico, China and elsewhere, The Polaris Effect was written to present a simple solution to what Americans can and must do now to create American jobs and a stronger economy. The book uses hope to empower American consumers to buy American-made products, thus changing the economy for good. 
To help American consumers make better purchasing decisions, Roedel even created a website, www.polariseffect.com, which introduces visitors to quality products made by workers in the U.S.

LSB Industries and Starboard Value Reach Agreement Regarding Corporate Governance and Board Composition | Business Wire
























































LSB Industries and Starboard Value Reach Agreement Regarding 
      Corporate Governance and Board Composition




Company to Add Five New Independent Directors: Louis Massimo, 
      Andrew Mittag, Marran Ogilvie, Richard Roedel and Lynn White


Announces Intention to Separate Chemicals and Climate Control 
      Businesses and to Explore MLP Structure for Chemicals Business Following 
      Completion of El Dorado Facility Expansion in 2016, Subject to Market 
      Conditions and Board Approval


New Lead Independent Director Appointed and Independent Board 
      Committee to Oversee Search for President of Chemicals Business








April 27, 2015 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LSB Industries, Inc. (NYSE:LXU) (“LSB” or “the Company”), a manufacturer 
      of chemical products for the agricultural, mining and industrial markets 
      and a leading manufacturer of commercial and residential climate control 
      products, today announced that it has elected Louis G. Massimo, Andrew 
      K. Mittag, Richard Roedel, Marran H. Ogilvie and Lynn F. White to its 
      Board of Directors. These five new independent directors, as well as 
      incumbent directors Richard Sanders and Barry Golsen, will stand for 
      re-election to LSB’s Board of Directors at the Company’s 2015 Annual 
      Meeting of Stockholders. Messrs. Massimo and Mittag will fill the 
      vacancies created by the resignations, effective today, of Gail Lapidus 
      and Robert Henry.
    


      If re-elected by LSB’s stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting, Ms. 
      Ogilvie and Messrs. Roedel, Sanders, Golsen and White will have terms 
      expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and Messrs. Massimo and Mittag will 
      join the class of directors with terms expiring at the 2017 Annual 
      Meeting. With these appointments, the LSB Board will expand to 13 
      directors, 11 of whom are independent and 9 of whom were appointed in 
      the last 24 months.
    

      “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Starboard on the 
      composition of the Board,” said Barry Golsen, Chief Executive Officer of 
      LSB. “On behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank Gail Lapidus 
      and Robert Henry for their dedicated service and contributions to the 
      Board and LSB. We look forward to working with the new independent 
      directors.”
    

      Mr. Golsen continued, “We remain committed to enhancing stockholder 
      value, and we believe the improvements we are making to increase 
      capacity and upgrade facilities will position LSB for enhanced growth 
      and profitability. We are therefore pleased to announce our intention, 
      once our El Dorado facility expansion projects have been completed and 
      brought online in 2016, to the extent market conditions allow and 
      subject to Board approval, to separate the Company’s Chemicals business 
      from its Climate Control business and to explore an MLP structure for 
      the Chemicals business.”
    

      In connection with today’s announcement, LSB has entered into an 
      agreement with Starboard Value LP (“Starboard”), which beneficially owns 
      approximately 7.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares. Under the 
      agreement, Starboard has agreed, among other things, not to solicit 
      proxies or participate in any “withhold” campaign in connection with the 
      2015 Annual Meeting and to vote its shares in support of all of the 
      Company’s director nominees. Starboard has also agreed to vote all of 
      its shares in accordance with the Board’s recommendation with respect to 
      the Company’s say-on-pay proposal, subject to the recommendation of 
      Institutional Shareholder Services.
    

      In addition, the responsibilities of the Strategic Committee of the 
      Board, which was formed in June 2014, will be expanded to include an 
      evaluation of Company’s corporate governance and management structure, 
      related party transactions and any other governance practices of the 
      Company deemed appropriate by the Strategic Committee. The Strategic 
      Committee will make recommendations to the Board based on its findings, 
      and the Company intends to announce the Board’s decisions with respect 
      to these recommendations concurrent with its second quarter 2015 
      earnings release.
    

      The Company also agreed to form an independent Board Committee to 
      oversee the Company’s previously announced executive search for a 
      President of the Chemicals business; this committee will consist of 
      Messrs. Daniel D. Greenwell, Sanders, Mittag and White. As previously 
      announced the company is working with executive search firm Spencer 
      Stuart to assist in the search.
    

      The Company also announced that Mr. Greenwell was elected Lead 
      Independent Director.
    

      Jeff Smith, CEO of Starboard, stated, “We are pleased that we have been 
      able to continue to work constructively with LSB to reach this 
      agreement, and we look forward to meaningful value creation. We believe 
      that strengthening the Board with highly experienced and independent 
      directors will support the Company in executing on its plans to drive 
      sales growth and profitability for the benefit of all shareholders. 
      Louis Massimo, Andrew Mittag, and Lynn White bring substantial 
      experience in the Chemicals and Fertilizer industries, which should help 
      LSB as it continues its progress in turning around and significantly 
      expanding this business. In addition, Marran Ogilvie and Richard Roedel 
      bring vast corporate governance experience that we believe will be 
      invaluable as the LSB Board reviews its governance practices.
    

      Mr. Smith continued, “We believe that a separation of LSB’s two highly 
      valuable businesses will create substantial value for all shareholders, 
      allowing each business to fully capitalize on the opportunities 
      available and enabling the Chemicals businesses to consider the 
      potential value creation available through an MLP structure following 
      the completion of the El Dorado expansion.”
    

      Credit Suisse is serving as financial advisor to LSB and Wachtell, 
      Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Conner & Winters, LLP are acting as legal 
      advisors.
