Women’s Health










Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy for Women
The signs and effects of the menopause transition can begin as early as age 35, although most women become aware of the transition in their mid to late 40s. Normally lasting for several years, its duration varies for every woman, and its course is impossible to predict. There are many symptoms that women, who are going through menopause and perimenopause, experience. However, every woman’s experience is different and most women may not experience every symptom. Some of the most common symptoms involved in hormone imbalance in women include hot flashes, nightsweats, irritability/mood swings, weight gain, vaginal dryness, and loss of libido. Because there is a large number of symptoms women experience, it is usually best to bring each of your symptoms up to your physician to be reviewed and discussed. An individualized treatment plan can be reviewed with you to decrease symptoms and improve your overall health by lessening the incidence of chronic conditions that may occur with aging.
Bio-Identical Hormone Pellet Therapy for Women
Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy using the pellet method has changed the manner women age. Today, we know that we don’t have to accept hormonal imbalance as a grim reality. Natural hormone replacement therapy has helped improve not only the quality of our lives, but also how long we live them. Some doctors continue to say that women should stop whining and embrace our menopausal woes, but why should we when the remedy is as simple as replacing missing hormones? By “bio-identical” we mean that the biochemical structure of the hormone is perfectly matched to the hormone produced in a woman’s body by her endocrine system. Bio-dentical hormones are plant-based, natural substances that our bodies can metabolize in the way it was designed to do, thus minimizing side effects. These compounded bio-identicals can be matched to each woman’s unique needs, something that’s impossible with mass-manufactured products.

Migraine Management
A migraine headache can cause intense throbbing or a pulsing sensation in one area of the head and is commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can cause significant pain for hours to days and be so severe that all you can think about is finding a dark, quiet place to lie down. Activities of daily living can be significantly affected by migraine patterns. Most migraines in women are triggered by a hormonal imbalance. When hormones are optimalized, women notice improvements in their migraine patterns such as less frequent migraines or complete resolution of migraines. We work collaboratively with local neurologists to provide the best management of migraines available.
HCG Diet
So what exactly can the HCG Shots do for you?
The HCG shots will enable you to go on a calorie deficit without having the feeling of starvation. Often, when a person is under a caloric deficit – especially in large numbers such as 600 and above, the person will tend to feel weak and always hungry which often results into binge eating. With these you can eat less and be on a caloric deficit without having to worry about starving. The HCG diet helps in metabolizing the unwanted fat in your body. In other words, it burns fat and enables you to maintain the muscle in your body. The HCG shots are enough to make you survive a 500 calorie diet without having to break down.
The common misconception with the HCG diet is that it is strictly for women. That is simply not the case because even men can greatly benefit from this diet. Don’t be deceived by the origins of the HCG – it is for anyone who needs and wants to lose weight.
Lipo-B Injections
Lipo-B injection ensures your body receives all necessary nutrients to keep you at your energetic best. Many of these nutrients are not absorbable by mouth and need to be taken by injection. Injections are safe, effective and an easy way to keep your body well-balanced. Vitamin B12 Lipotropic injections help increase your energy as well as contribute to the success of your weight loss plan.

Packages









Venus Freeze “Mommy Makeover” Alternative* 



8 Treatments for only $2,000 (a savings of $800)
Tired of working hard at the gym to flatten your tummy, yet not seeing the results you’re looking for? After childbirth, women often find it difficult to regain the midsection they once had, regardless of the effort they make to eat right and exercise regularly. With our Venus Freeze, we are able to assist you in a non-invasive, pain-free series of treatments that allow you to maintain your active lifestyle.
How it Works:
Using patented (MP)² technology, Venus Freeze utilizes multi-polar radio frequency and Pulsed Magnetic fields which produce a soothing and therapeutic heat matrix over the skin. Skin tightening, wrinkle reduction and cellulite reduction occur because the multi-polar radio frequency causes a thermal reaction in the tissue which stimulates the body’s natural healing response. This restoring response causes new collagen to form and the production of new elastin fibres. The active collage in the skin contracts, achieving tighter skin, softening of wrinkles and reduced cellulite.
Individually these treatments are $350 per session, but you can take advantage of our package discount and start seeing the results you’re looking for!
*Treatment is limited to abdominal area only per session, with best results achieved after eight sessions

Sexual Dysfunction









What is Sexual dysfunction?
Female sexual dysfunction is not a small problem: 50% of women experience some degree of low libido and dysfunction. Female Sexual Arousal Disorder occurs in 5% of women, which may not sound like a lot, but when you think about it, that is 1 in 20. Women who suffer from sexual arousal disorder may want to have sex but have much difficulty finding the pleasure of arousal. Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (or Low desire) is another type of sexual dysfunction experienced by women. Approximately 10% of women suffer with this problem. Another sexual disorder women may experience is Female Orgasmic Disorder. This is when a woman can become sexually aroused but has great difficulty achieving or cannot achieve an orgasm.

Low desire occurs in approximately 5% of the female population. Lastly, dyspareunia is a condition where the woman experiences real pain with intercourse. The incidence of dyspareunia is from 1 in 10 to 1 in 5 women. (The previous statistics were from the Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology April 2011).
During my practice I have encountered numerous women with the above complaints and have been able to improve and even eliminate their symptoms. Suffering with a sexual disorder disorder does not simply make sex unenjoyable, it can lead to stress on their relationships and decrease in self- confidence as well as symptoms of depression. Improving a women’s sexual life can lead to increased energy, more confidence, less depression, and improved overall health.
Although each woman’s experience may differ in some ways, many patients report:

Greater arousal from clitoral stimulation
Younger, smoother skin of the vulva (lips of the vagina)
A tighter introitus (vaginal opening)
Stronger orgasm
More frequent orgasm
Increased ability to have a vaginal orgasm
Decreased pain for those with dyspareunia (painful intercourse)
Increased natural lubrication
Decreased or resolved urinary incontinence (both urge and stress problems
After the procedure, there’s no recovery time needed. You may experience minimal side effects. The most
common side effect following injection includes scant bleeding from the needle injection site.
Within 4 hours following the in office procedure you may resume normal sexual activity. Note that results vary.

Venus Freeze









What is Venus Freeze™?
The Venus Freeze is a revolutionary treatment which is highly effective in circumference reduction, improving cellulite, skin tightening and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Venus Freeze uses pulsed magnetic fields, which provide you with the added benefits of increased oxygen, nutrients and blood to the skin – giving it an immediate and long lasting glow. Our Promise is to provide you with a safe, pleasant, and pain-free experience in treatments for the face and body including arms, abdomen, thighs, buttocks, neck and face.
How it Works
Using patented (MP)² technology, Venus Freeze utilizes multi-polar radio frequency and Pulsed Magnetic fields which produce a soothing and therapeutic heat matrix over the skin. Skin tightening, wrinkle reduction and cellulite reduction occur because the multi-polar radio frequency causes a thermal reaction in the tissue which stimulates the body’s natural healing response. This restoring response causes new collagen to form and the production of new elastin fibres. The active collage in the skin contracts, achieving tighter skin, softening of wrinkles and reduced cellulite.

What to Expect
Venus Freeze treatments are non-invasive and painless, with many patients comparing the treatment to a hot-stone massage! Treatments take approximately 30-40mins depending on the area, you can expect to see results as the treatments progress, a minimum of 6 treatments for the face, 8 on the neck and 10 on the body.

Mereo BioPharma Announces Formal Launch of Company; Raises $119m (c.£76.5m) and Acquires Innovative Mid-Stage Clinical Product Portfolio From Leading Pharmaceutical Company

LONDON, July 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
A new UK company focused on acquiring, rapidly developing and commercialising innovative medicines to transform patient quality of life and improve human health 
Highly experienced management team; blue chip  investors 
 
Mereo BioPharma Group Ltd ("Mereo"), a recently-formed speciality biopharmaceutical company, announces that it has successfully raised $119m (c. £76.5m), gross, from blue chip institutional investors and simultaneously acquired a portfolio of three innovative clinical-stage development programmes from Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Novartis, through the shares issued in consideration for the acquisition of products, will also hold an equity stake in Mereo.  
Mereo is a new UK-based company whose mission is to acquire and rapidly develop innovative medicines that have the potential to transform patient quality of life and improve human health. Mereo intends to optimise the commercial value of programmes by entering into partnering deals at key value inflection points or, for selected opportunities, commercialising products itself. Mereo is building a strong pipeline of innovative medicines, particularly focused in rare and specialist disease areas, through the acquisition of validated, mid-stage development programmes from large biopharmaceutical companies.  Mereo has access to an extensive network of experts with experience across multiple clinical disciplines and has entered into a strategic development partnership with ICON, a leading global contract research organisation (CRO), for the clinical development of its portfolio.  
Key investment highlights for Mereo are as follows:

An innovative product portfolio from Novartis 


Mereo's initial mid-stage portfolio comprises three exceptionally well characterised, novel products for the treatment of diseases with considerable unmet medical need, acquired from Novartis. Each programme has a comprehensive dataset, including proof of concept clinical studies. Mereo's pipeline comprises the following programmes:  

BPS-804 in the orphan disease Osteogenesis Imperfecta or Brittle Bone Syndrome is a fully human monoclonal antibody which is being developed to improve bone density (and thereby reduce fractures) in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), commonly known as brittle bone syndrome.



BCT-197  in acute exacerbations of COPD is an orally active p38 MAP kinase inhibitor being developed as first-line acute therapy alongside existing treatment and supportive care for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).  



BGS-649 in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is a novel orally active aromatase inhibitor being developed as a first-line therapy for the treatment of obese men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH), with the aim of normalising testosterone levels.  



Strategic development partnership with ICON 


Mereo's strategic partnership with ICON provides a dedicated global team working closely with Mereo from pre-acquisition through to conduct of global clinical studies for its pipeline products. The relationship has been structured to enable Mereo to expand its product portfolio without the addition of significant internal resources.  

A strong investor base 


Mereo has secured $119m (c. £76.5m), gross, from UK institutional investors Woodford Investment Management and Invesco Perpetual. In addition, Novartis, through the shares issued in consideration for the acquisition of products, will hold an equity stake in Mereo and intends to make a cash investment in Mereo in future financings.  

A highly experienced management team 


The team is led by Dr Denise Scots-Knight (Pollard-Knight) as Chief Executive Officer, formerly Managing Partner of the healthcare-focused venture capital investor Phase4 Partners and Dr Peter Fellner as Chairman, who has a wide range of experience in biotechnology and pharma companies. Mereo's management team is highly experienced in identifying and selecting new product opportunities, managing clinical development pipelines, capital raising and structuring in- and out-licensing transactions.
Commenting on today's announcement, Dr Denise Scots-Knight, CEO of Mereo said:  
"We believe that by acquiring quality assets from Novartis and securing substantial financing we have put in place the building blocks to create a successful specialty biopharmaceutical company.  Through the experience and connections of the team and Board  we are delighted to have been able to work with a visionary global leader in Novartis Pharmaceuticals  in building a new model to help optimise the development of  pharmaceutical pipelines. We believe the exceptional experience and track record of the Mereo  team and Board  will enable us to rapidly build a globally competitive business."    
Commenting on today's announcement, Dr Peter Fellner, Chairman of Mereo said:
"We believe the substantial fundraising underpinning the launch of Mereo is a strong endorsement from the investment community of our vision to create a UK-based biopharmaceutical leader. This reflects both the extensive experience of the management team and Board, as well as the extremely high quality of programmes acquired from Novartis which form the initial portfolio of Mereo."    
WG Partners LLP acted as advisor to Mereo BioPharma in connection with this transaction. Proskauer teams in London and New York provided legal advice to Mereo Biopharma in relation to the transaction.
 
About Mereo 
Mereo is based in London and was founded in March 2015 to fund and develop novel, innovative specialist focused products from large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.  
Pharmaceutical companies face increasingly difficult choices in the allocation of internal resources to their drug development programs.  With significant P&L constraints and rich pipelines it has become increasingly difficult for many companies to fully fund and advance development all of their drug candidates, especially beyond Phase 2. Mereo has been formed to take advantage of the global pharmaceutical industry's drive for creative ways to progress their clinical development pipelines.  
Mereo has acquired an initial mid-late stage portfolio of three exceptionally well characterised novel products for the treatment of diseases with considerable unmet medical need from Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Each of these programmes has a comprehensive dataset for both pre-clinical and proof-of-concept clinical studies.  Additional product opportunities are under evaluation.
Mereo's focus is the development of innovative medicines that have the potential to significantly transform the lives of patients suffering from rare and other specialised conditions around the world.  To do this, the Company depends on the combination of its team's expertise in selecting and acquiring product opportunities, creating value in the development pipeline and structuring creative transactions. Mereo's internal expertise is complemented by a unique partnership with a leading global CRO, ICON.
Mereo combines the operational discipline and efficiency of a small company with the financial resources to conduct comprehensive clinical studies.  Mereo will rapidly progress each of the products through further value inflection points before partnering or divesting its products.  The Company also has the option to directly commercialise products, for example in orphan disease indications.

About osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) 
OI is an orphan genetic disorder that is characterized by fragile bones that break easily. In addition to fractures, people with OI often have muscle weakness, hearing loss, fatigue, joint laxity, curved bones, scoliosis, and short stature. The majority of cases of OI (possibly 85-90 %) are caused by a dominant mutation in a gene coding for type I collagen, a key component of healthy bone. Treatment of OI is supportive, focusing on minimizing fractures and maximizing mobility, but to date, there are no treatments that address the underlying bone weakness.
About acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) 
An AECOPD is characterised by a sudden worsening in the COPD patient's symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum production. They last for several days and requiring in a step up of medication and often hospitalisation. AECOPDs occur in the natural course of the disease but are commonly triggered by infections and air pollution but one third do not have an identifiable trigger. Both airway and systemic inflammation are characteristic drivers of the disease.
About hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) 
HH in men is a clinical syndrome that results from inadequate levels of testosterone. This can be primary, or secondary due to disruption of one of more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. After the age of 30, the level of testosterone decreases by about 1-2% per year. In the obese the decrease in testosterone is increased by the high levels of the aromatase enzyme in the fat tissue. These are both considered secondary hypogonadism. Low levels of testosterone have been related to a range of health outcomes including increasing levels of obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, depression, and osteoporosis.

Mereo BioPharma Group Ltd.. (7/29/15). "Press Release: Mereo BioPharma Announces Formal Launch of Company, Raises $118m". London.
Mereo BioPharma announces formal launch of Company; raises $118m (c.£76.5m) and acquires innovative mid-stage clinical product portfolio from leading pharmaceutical company

A new UK company focused on acquiring, rapidly developing and commercialising innovative medicines to transform patient quality of life and improve human health

Highly experienced management team; blue chip and deep-pocketed investors


Mereo BioPharma Group Ltd (�Mereo�), a recently-formed speciality biopharmaceutical company, announces that it has successfully raised $118m (c. £76.5m), gross, from blue chip institutional investors and simultaneously acquired a portfolio of three innovative clinical-stage development programmes from Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Novartis, through the shares issued in consideration for the acquisition of products, will also hold an equity stake in Mereo.

Mereo is a new UK-based company whose mission is to acquire and rapidly develop innovative medicines that have the potential to transform patient quality of life and improve human health. Mereo intends to optimise the commercial value of programmes by entering into partnering deals at key value inflection points or, for selected opportunities, commercialising products itself. Mereo is building a strong pipeline of innovative medicines, particularly focused in rare and specialist disease areas, through the acquisition of validated, mid-stage development programmes from large biopharmaceutical companies. Mereo has access to an extensive network of experts with experience across multiple clinical disciplines and has entered into a strategic development partnership with ICON, a leading global contract research organisation (CRO), for the clinical development of its portfolio.


Key investment highlights for Mereo are as follows:


An innovative product portfolio from Novartis

Mereo�s initial mid-stage portfolio comprises three exceptionally well characterised, novel products for the treatment of diseases with considerable unmet medical need, acquired from Novartis. Each programme has a comprehensive dataset, including proof of concept clinical studies. Mereo�s pipeline comprises the following programmes:

BPS-804 in the orphan disease Osteogenesis Imperfecta or Brittle Bone Syndrome is a fully human monoclonal antibody which is being developed to improve bone density (and thereby reduce fractures) in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), commonly known as brittle bone syndrome.

BCT-197 in acute exacerbations of COPD is an orally active p38 MAP kinase inhibitor being developed as first-line acute therapy alongside existing treatment and supportive care for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

BGS-649 in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is a novel orally active aromatase inhibitor being developed as a first-line therapy for the treatment of obese men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH), with the aim of normalising testosterone levels.


Strategic development partnership with ICON

Mereo�s strategic partnership with ICON provides a dedicated global team working closely with Mereo from pre-acquisition through to conduct of global clinical studies for its pipeline products. The relationship has been structured to enable Mereo to expand its product portfolio without the addition of significant internal resources.


A strong investor base

Mereo has secured $118m (c. £76.5m), gross, from UK institutional investors Woodford Investment Management and Invesco Perpetual. In addition, Novartis, through the shares issued in consideration for the acquisition of products, will hold an equity stake in Mereo and intends to make a cash investment in Mereo in future financings.


A highly experienced management team

The team is led by Dr Denise Scots-Knight (Pollard-Knight) as Chief Executive Officer, formerly Managing Partner of the healthcare-focused venture capital investor Phase4 Partners and Dr Peter Fellner as Chairman, who has a wide range of experience in biotechnology and pharma companies. Mereo�s management team is highly experienced in identifying and selecting new product opportunities, managing clinical development pipelines, capital raising and structuring in- and out-licensing transactions.


Commenting on today�s announcement, Dr Denise Scots-Knight, CEO of Mereo said:
�We believe that by acquiring quality assets from Novartis and securing substantial financing we have put in place the building blocks to create a successful specialty biopharmaceutical company. Through the experience and connections of the team and Board we are delighted to have been able to work with a visionary global leader in Novartis Pharmaceuticals in building a new model to help optimise the development of pharmaceutical pipelines. We believe the exceptional experience and track record of the Mereo team and Board will enable us to rapidly build a globally competitive business.�

Commenting on today�s announcement, Dr Peter Fellner, Chairman of Mereo said:
�We believe the substantial fundraising underpinning the launch of Mereo is a strong endorsement from the investment community of our vision to create a UK-based biopharmaceutical leader. This reflects both the extensive experience of the management team and Board, as well as the extremely high quality of programmes acquired from Novartis which form the initial portfolio of Mereo.�
