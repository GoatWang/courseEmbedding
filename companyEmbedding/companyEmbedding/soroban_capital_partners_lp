What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

   Hedge Funds-News  Eric Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners Discloses 10% Activist Position    Published on February 3, 2015 at 11:56 am by  
                                Tim Frederick
                                  in Hedge Funds,News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           Eric Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners has taken up a 10% activist position in California Resources Corp (NYSE:CRC), according to a filing on Monday with the SEC. Soroban disclosed ownership of 38.47 million shares, 9.98% of all Common Shares. Soroban is the first hedge fund to disclose such a position in the recently spun-off company.   Soroban (which is named after a Japanese abacus) was started in 2010 by Mandelblatt, who had previously been a partner and co-CEO at TPG-Axon Capital Management LP. The fund has a focus on equity trading, and has quickly built an equity portfolio valued at over $13 billion as of September 30.  Given Mandelblatt’s background as a former energy analyst for Goldman Sachs, it’s unsurprising Soroban has invested in a number of different companies in the sector, including Cheniere Energy Inc. (NYSEMKT:LNG), one of their top holdings throughout 2014. Midstream energy was an industry Mandelblatt highlighted as being one with particularly interesting opportunties prior to launching his fund. It becomes even less surprising when one considers Soroban’s interest in California Resources Corp (NYSE:CRC)’s former parent company Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Soroban has held call options on Occidental since the second half of 2013, and those options represented the second most valuable position in their equity portfolio as of September 30, when they increased them by 65% to 11.38 million. Soroban clearly feels very strongly about Occidental’s spun-off California division, which was formerly a subsidiary of Occidental. At the time of the spin-off announcement back in February, 2014, the California subsidiary accounted for one-fifth of Occidental’s total oil and natural gas production. In the third quarter of 2014, they produced the equivalent of 160,000 barrels of oil per day, and hold 2.3 million net acres of drilling rights in California. The spin-off of the subsidiary was completed on November 30, and California Resources Corp (NYSE:CRC) began trading publicly on the NYSE on December 1 at $7.37, which was well below estimates of where the stock would open. Issued shares to Occidental shareholders began trading off-market in the middle of November at $8.45, which was 15% below the $10.00 range expected. However, slumping crude oil prices conspired to greatly limit the value of the new company from earlier estimates, and it would continue to drop over the following two months, to as low as $3.93 in late January. Since then the stock has rebounded by more than 30%, and has vaulted another 10% in early morning trading today, as crude oil appears to be rebounding slightly from its record-low levels, down more than 50% since June. Those low oil prices prompted California Resources Corp (NYSE:CRC) to give up on a previously planned drilling project in Carson, California, which they first proposed in 2012. The plan would’ve called for 200 wells to be built in the Dominguez Oil Fields south of Los Angeles, which is estimated to hold 52 million barrels of oil. The oil would’ve been extracted through the use of the controversial fracking procedure.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Hedging Strategy:

      

No Hedging

          Short-Exposure Hedge
        

          Moving Average Hedge
        

Moving Average Months:


Moving Average Target:
                   

Your backtested portfolio
S&P 500 TR Index
Russell 2K TR Index

the moving average that will determine when hedging is on or off

Hedging %:
      

25%
50%
75%
100%



Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                Manager Monday: Soroban Capital Partners            






 Matt Giordano
Senior Associate, Client Analytics




 
                        Named after a Japanese abacus, Soroban Capital Parters outperforms by sticking to their fundamental investment philosophy.                    





A Japanese Abacus
Let’s open this week with a little game. Name the first three activist managers that come to mind. Odds are those names are the ones that grab the headlines in the Wall Street Journal or cable news (I’m sure many of you remember seeing Icahn and Ackman throwing figurative punches on CNBC not too long ago). That said, blustery rhetoric on TV doesn’t always equal alpha for your investors.
I’d be willing to guess one name is not on your list. Eric Mandelblatt, who after leaving TPG Axon in 2010 with a small team, founded Soroban Capital Partners. Much more quietly than their bloviating counterparts, Soroban has been achieving outsized returns for just as long, and will be the focus of this article.
Mandelblatt’s under-the-radar nature shouldn’t come as a surprise to those who know the source of their fund’s name. An abacus developed in Japan in the 14th century, Sorobans are still widely used today despite many available electronic calculation alternatives. This name-based allusion to tradition, straight-to-the-point effectiveness and an air of simplicity could go a long way to explaining the firm’s very successful approach to business.
A quick note before we continue. As with all our Manager Mondays, keep in mind that everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data, including the manager’s profile, simulated performance and all other analysis. The data used here omits the short side, non-equity securities, many non-US securities and all non-public information such as actual fund performance. Regardless, this data can be incredibly insightful if viewed with the right prism.
Soroban’s Performance and Growth
Since January of 2012, the fund’s first required reporting period, one can see Soroban’s simulated portfolio strongly outperforming both the general DJ Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index (BM1) and the HFRX Activist Index (BM2).

The fund’s longs returned 134.39% against 19.13% for the HF Index and 44.85% for the Activists. For greater context, the S&P 500 was up 79.4% over the time period, highlighting some of the recent struggles within the Hedge Fund industry as a whole. Soroban was neither scathed by the afflictions of its brethren nor constrained by the market as a whole, convincingly cruising along on a wave of outperformance.
As one might expect, with great investment success comes great assets, visualized through the proxy of market value. Soroban’s market value rose drastically over the interval, from a shade under $2 Billion to over $12.5 Billion presently.

As this happens, many funds can become victims of their own success. In these situations, we at Novus usually look for three main levers a fund can pull as it grows. How did Soroban cope with their growth? Did they:

Increase the number of positions? With some variance, the fund increased positions from 30 to 36, but this change is not necessarily commensurate with their overall increase in market value.



Fall into a liquidity trap? Again, save the one outlying data point this is not so. On the whole Soroban has remained very liquid over the interval.



Move up the market cap spectrum? Here we do find evidence of a trend, with Soroban moving from the upper Mid Cap range of $10 Billion at the end of 2011 to a strongly Large Cap number of over $32 Billion at present. We’ll look at this in more detail in our next section.


I can hear you saying, “This is all well and good, but what can I actually derive from this?” From this data, I draw one main conclusion. Soroban was ready to grow, and were one step ahead of the curve. They were ready to be scalable from the outset, seamlessly adjusting to their new realities.
The Scaled-Up Soroban Portfolio
If we cross-section this scalability as of the 31 December filing period, one can see Soroban’s top 5 long positions by issuer:

These are major global firms, large brand names. Considering the upward Market Cap shift, this is understandable and potentially expected. Expanding this to the whole portfolio, and slicing by Market Cap, one will notice – also unsurprisingly – that the current main capital allocation is in the Mega Cap space (52%), with an additional substantial allocation to Large Cap (39.7%).

Using Novus’ recently released multi-grouping functionality, within those main Market Cap buckets you can see, on a sector level:

13 of the 14 Mega Cap positions are focused in Staples, Discretionary, IT and Telecom



While the smaller allocation to large cap names actually has greater sector diversity, with the notable entry of the Energy Sector


As well as getting a glimpse into Soroban’s post-scale sector positioning, we can evidence where the fund has seen sector value over time. Looking from their first filing until today, you can see consistent long allocations into the Discretionary sector, while the current portfolio has pivoted substantial assets into IT and Staples at the expense of the recently troubled Energy sector. This evident pragmatism with respect to the Energy sector alludes to the core Soroban approach we touched on in the introduction.

Now that we have this understanding into the nimble way in which the firm has grown as well as their current long portfolio structure, let’s move back into the world of the (quite good) performance metrics and derive some more insights there.
How Soroban Outperforms
The high-level attribution statistics for Soroban’s long portfolio over time are pretty outstanding.

The firm has won on 72% of their investments, while allocating 82% of their capital to those investments. These two metrics help to explain an excellent 1.59x Win/Loss ratio in which Soroban has on average made 133.14bps relative to 84bps on a loser, showing the fund’s ability to nip losing investments in the bud while sticking with their winners.
Relative to the S&P 1500 and their associated sector benchmarks, Soroban generated 5,875bps – 45% of their total contribution – via security selection alpha.

This alpha was achieved across the sector spectrum with only the most minor of detractors. These broad wins evidence core, persistent, fundamental firm strength over time rather than a return stream with fluky outliers and inconsistent or volatile contributors. This is exactly what you want to see as a prospective or existing investor, and doesn’t surprise me considering the firm culture I’ve derived.

This win/loss analysis and broad alpha contribution led me to consider how the fund sized their positions over time, and what I found here was a tad surprising.

Though the firm did outperform a portfolio in which each of their positions was equally weighted over time, more often than not with numbers as strong as we’ve seen one might expect to see greater alpha here. Taking it a step deeper and visualizing win/loss ratio by position sizing bucket, one metric stands out, that of the 7.5% – 10% bracket.

If Soroban is able to nudge this up toward the firm average, they could see even greater outsized returns in the future, with other conditions remaining the same. However, this is admittedly nit-picky since Soroban is still generating excess returns (130.6% versus 123% on a cumulative basis) via position sizing. Summarily, it seems as even when they are wrong, they are right.
Final Considerations
What we’ve seen here is a relatively young fund punching with the heavyweights. They’ve scaled-up effectively and continued to outpace the hedge fund industry, their activist counterparts and the market. Additionally, they’ve done this in a time period that hasn’t been overly kind to the hedge fund industry as a whole. Soroban as a fund may not stay under the radar much longer, but don’t be surprised if Mr. Mandelblatt continues to avoid the limelight, focusing on continuing to produce clean, efficient, and effective calculations on his abacus. If what is above is any indicator, this should be welcome news to his investors.


Investor Transparency
Complementing Risk Reports with Public Positions

Although managers have increased the transparency that they provide to investors, moving from just returns to monthly risk reports or better, there is a way to learn more about a manager without asking for increased private transparency: public positions.
For this report, we created an example manager with monthly risk reports that have sector and market cap breakdowns since January of 2011, along with some other top level stats like concentration of the top 10 names(%). Here we will show investors how to evaluate their managers using both private risk reports and public positions to ensure their investments are paying off.
