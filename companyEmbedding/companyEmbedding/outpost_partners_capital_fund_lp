Articles and Features











SkyBridge Capital, which provides strategic capital to new and early-stage hedge funds, has invested in  Outpost Investment Group, LLC, a New York-based global macro-focused investment management firm.  This investment is the first by SkyBridge Capital's new fund, SkyBridge Capital II, LLC.  
Outpost Investment Group's discretionary Global Macro Fund is focused on delivering stable alpha to institutional investors primarily through G10 fixed income, currency, equity, and commodity investments.
The firm's investment team combines top-down macro research with bottom-up micro catalysts. Outpost was founded in March 2008 by Peter Forlenza, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Bajaj, Chief Investment Officer; and Allen Arakal, Portfolio Manager.  The investment team is rounded out by Martin Walker, Portfolio Manager, and Robert S. Morris, Global Energy Portfolio Manager. 
 In addition to providing Outpost with long-term strategic capital, SkyBridge Capital will seek to enhance its investment in Outpost by providing business-building support. This investment is the first by SkyBridge Capital's new fund, SkyBridge Capital II, LLC.  In aggregate, SkyBridge Capital and its underlying managers currently have approximately USD 1.8 billion under management.  
'We are pleased to partner with Outpost's team of talented investment managers,' said Scott Prince, Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital.  'They stand apart from other global macro managers we've evaluated, differentiated by their strong pedigree and approach to risk management, and we look forward to a long-lasting relationship with them.'
Peter Forlenza, Outpost's CEO, was previously the Global Head of Equities for Bank of America, managing a range of products including Equity Derivatives, Cash Equity Sales and Trading, Equity Capital Markets, Portfolio Trading, Prime Brokerage/Equity Finance, Equity Research and all Equity Proprietary Trading.  As a member of the Bank of America Global Markets Leadership Team and Global Risk Committee, he was part of a small group of executives managing the entire global markets business and evaluating all of the risk across all Fixed Income and Equity businesses.  Prior to Bank of America, Forlenza was a senior executive at Citigroup and its predecessor firms Salomon Smith Barney and Salomon Brothers. He held dual roles at Citigroup before his departure: Head of European Equity Trading and Global Head of Portfolio Trading. He began his career at Salomon Brothers and is credited with being one of the industry's pioneers in Program Trading, a business he built from inception for Salomon. 
 
Jason Bajaj was most recently a Managing Director within the equities division at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Prior to Goldman Sachs, he was a Portfolio Manager at Triloka Capital where he managed the Global Macro and Event trading business.  He was a key contributor in all aspects of the business development, including the building of trading and risk management systems, infrastructure creation, and managing and researching new trade opportunities. Before Triloka, Bajaj worked at Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley focusing on Japan and Asia proprietary macro risk trading. 
Allen Arakal, Partner and Portfolio Manager, has 14 years of trading and financial markets experience.  Prior to founding Outpost, Allen was a strategist at JWM Partners, LLC where he worked on the Yen Interest Rate Relative Value Portfolio for the last two years.  He was responsible for day-to-day risk management, modeling, trade idea generation and execution for all yen rate products.  Previously, Allen spent a brief period consulting with Pantera Global Macro Fund on risk and cash management.  Prior to that, he spent twelve years at Goldman Sachs Group working in New York, Tokyo and London where he traded various interest rate products from money markets to interest rate derivatives.
