	This Annual Report
	contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,”
	“believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “plan,” “seek,”
	“expect,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,”
	“contemplate,” “continue,” “target” and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements
	include, but are not limited to:


	 







	·



	statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;




	 







	·



	statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;




	 







	·



	statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and




	 







	·



	estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.




	 


	These forward-looking
	statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive
	uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject
	to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and
	do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report.


	 


	The following factors,
	among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the
	forward-looking statements:


	 







	·



	our ability to manage our operations under the current adverse economic conditions nationally and
	in our market area;




	 







	·



	adverse changes in the financial industry, securities, credit and national local real estate markets
	(including real estate values);




	 







	·



	significant increases in our loan losses, including as a result of our inability to resolve classified
	and non-performing assets or reduce risks associated with our loans, and management’s assumptions in determining the adequacy
	of the allowance for loan losses;




	 







	·



	credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies
	and write-offs and in our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses;




	 







	·



	competition among depository and other financial institutions;




	 







	·



	our success in implementing our business strategy, particularly increasing our commercial real
	estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending;




	 







	·



	our success in introducing new financial products;




	 







	·



	our ability to attract and maintain deposits;




	 






	 



	2



	 







	 




	 







	·



	our ability to continue to improve our asset quality even as we increase our non-residential and
	non-owner occupied residential lending;




	 







	·



	changes in interest rates generally, including changes in the relative differences between short
	term and long term interest rates and in deposit interest rates, that may affect our net interest margin and funding sources;




	 







	·



	fluctuations in the demand for loans, which may be affected by the number of unsold homes, land
	and other properties in our market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our market area;




	 







	·



	changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits;




	 







	·



	declines in the yield on our assets resulting from the current low interest rate environment;




	 







	·



	risks related to a high concentration of loans secured by real estate located in our market area;




	 







	·



	the results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators may,
	among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down assets, change our regulatory capital position,
	limit our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could adversely
	affect our dividends and earnings;




	 







	·

	a Maryland corporation, was formed on February 27, 2014 and owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pilgrim
	Bank. On October 10, 2014, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock. In the offering, Pilgrim

	Our executive and administrative
	office is located at 40 South Main Street, Cohasset, Massachusetts 02025, and our telephone number at this address is (781) 383-0541.
	Our website address is www.bankpilgrim.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report and should not

	Pilgrim Bank


	 


	Pilgrim Bank is a Massachusetts
	stock co-operative bank that was originally organized in 1916 under the name Pilgrim Co-operative Bank as a Massachusetts mutual
	co-operative bank. In 2005, the Bank changed its name to Pilgrim Bank.


	 


	We conduct our operations
	from our main office and an adjacent operations center in Cohasset, Massachusetts and our two additional full-service banking offices
	located in Cohasset and Marion, Massachusetts. Our business consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public and
	investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial
	real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We have
	historically conducted our lending operations with a view towards the specific needs of customers in the communities that we serve,
	measuring our success by customer satisfaction and the extent of our customer relationships, rather than on volume based loan origination.


	 


	Market Area and Competition


	 


	Our primary market
	area is the South Shore and South Coast areas of Massachusetts, which includes portions of Plymouth, Norfolk and Bristol counties.
	We serve customers located in a number of small towns in these areas, including Cohasset, Scituate, Hull, Hingham, Norwell, Marshfield,
	Marion, Mattapoisett, Plymouth, Rochester and Wareham. Although our current operations are not focused in Boston, we are affected
	by economic conditions in Boston because our loan portfolio includes a significant number of loans that are secured by real estate
	or that have borrowers located in Boston. In addition, a number of our customers who reside in our market area are employed in
	Boston and a number of our non-owner occupied residential and multi-family loan customers have properties in Boston as well as
	in our market area. We intend to continue to make loans, particularly commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied
	residential and construction loans, in Boston, so we will continue to be affected by economic conditions in Boston.

	Competition in the
	banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions,
	mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking
	firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them
	in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able
	to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term
	basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest
	rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely
	affected.


	 


	Lending Activities




	 






	General.


	As
	a traditional thrift institution, we have historically focused on one- to four-family owner occupied residential lending, including
	jumbo mortgages and owner occupied construction. In recent years, we have expanded to include non-owner occupied investment residential,
	commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans.
	Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial real estate
	and multi-family, construction and commercial and industrial lending, in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and
	increase the overall yield earned on our loans. From time to time, for purposes of managing interest rate risk, we also sell in
	the secondary market some of the long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-retained,
	non-recourse basis. All of our loan sales to date have been to the Federal Home Loan Bank Mortgage Partnership Finance Program.
	In addition, for purposes of managing interest rate risk, generating income and diversifying our portfolio, we regularly purchase
	owner occupied residential real estate loans and consumer loans, particularly automobile loans. Residential real estate loans are
	purchased on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis. These loans are high quality loans and are usually purchased
	from another bank. Automobile loans are purchased at 90% of the outstanding balance and the seller retains 10% ownership as well
	as the servicing.

	The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan at the dates indicated,

	Loan Approval
	Procedures and Authority

	.

	Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any
	one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 20% of Pilgrim Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.
	Our board of directors has adopted an in-house limit for loans to one borrower or a group of related borrowers equal to $4.0 million.


	 


	Our lending is subject
	to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed
	applications submitted by the prospective borrower. In addition, for one- to four-family residential, non-owner occupied residential,
	commercial real estate and multi-family loans we generally obtain an appraisal from an independent licensed appraiser and a secondary
	review by a separate independent licensed appraiser. In certain circumstances where the total loan amount is less than $250,000,
	we may rely on internal valuations or tax assessments in lieu of an independent appraisal. All appraisers are approved by our board
	of directors, and the appraisers that we utilize to perform secondary reviews do not perform primary appraisals for us. The loan
	applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant
	items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, financial statements and tax returns.


	 


	Lending personnel have
	approval authority commensurate with their experience and loan performance history. Loans in excess of any officer’s individual
	authority and up to the “in-house limit” established by the board of directors and loans containing any exceptions
	to our loan policies must be approved by the Executive Committee, which is comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer
	and three independent members of our board of directors. The Executive Committee serves as the Loan Committee. Loans in excess
	of the “in-house limit” must be approved by the board of directors. The Bank also engages an independent third party
	to conduct loan reviews on all lending relationships in excess of $1.0 million. This review is performed on an annual basis.

	One- to Four-Family
	Residential Real Estate Lending

	.

	The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family
	residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2016, we had $134.0 million of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate,
	representing 63.5% of our total loan portfolio, which includes $26.5 million of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential
	real estate, representing 12.5% of our total loan portfolio. We primarily originate adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans,
	but we also offer fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. At December 31, 2016, $93.3 million or 69.6%, of
	our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and $40.7 million, or 30.4% of such loans were adjustable-rate
	loans.


	 


	Our fixed-rate one-
	to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to FHLB Mortgage Partnership Financing Program
	and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally
	originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by
	the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Freddie Mac, which as of December 31, 2016, was generally greater than $424,000 for single-family
	homes in our market area. We also originate owner-occupied residential mortgage loans above the lending limit for conforming loans
	to borrowers, which are referred to as “jumbo loans,” generally to borrowers in our market area. Our jumbo loans are
	generally adjustable-rate loans, although we have in the past, subject to market and competitive conditions, originated long-term
	fixed-rate jumbo loans. At December 31, 2016, we had jumbo loans of $69.4 million, or 64.6% of our owner occupied one- to four-family
	residential loans and 32.9% of our total loans, of which $21.9 million were originated by Pilgrim Bank and $47.5 million were purchased
	loans. The original balances on these loans were $74.0 million, of which $25.3 million were originated by Pilgrim Bank and $48.7
	million were purchased loans.


	 


	We generally limit
	the loan-to-value ratios of our owner-occupied mortgage loans to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower.
	Private mortgage insurance is generally required on all loans with loan-to-value ratios above 80%.


	 


	Our fixed-rate one-
	to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years. Historically, we offered a wide variety of
	initial terms on our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans; however, in recent years we have begun
	offering initial terms of three or five years on our adjustable-rate loans. In both instances, the interest rate adjusts annually
	at a margin after the initial term. Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity
	ranging from 10 to 30 years. Our loans on second homes typically have terms of 10 to 30 years.


	 


	Recent changes to residential
	mortgage lending regulations promulgated by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau may have an impact on future mortgage business.
	We intend to underwrite Qualified Mortgages (“QM Loans”) as defined by the regulations. In addition, our Board of Directors
	has authorized the origination of mortgage loans that qualify for the small creditor exemption. Based on our market area, many
	of our future residential mortgages will be covered by this exemption. We have no plans to issue non-QM loans at this time.


	 


	We also offer home
	equity loans (second mortgages) and lines of credit in both a first and second position.




	At December 31, 2016, we
	had $2.3 million, or 1.1% of our loan portfolio, in home equity lines of credit. Additionally, at December 31, 2016 the unadvanced
	amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $4.1 million. Our home equity lines of credit are secured by residential property,
	and generally have terms of fifteen years with a 10- year draw period and 5-year or 10-year repayment periods. We generally do
	not originate home equity loans, or home equity lines of credit unless the loan-to-value ratio, combined with the first mortgage,
	is less than 75%, Our home equity lines of credit are all adjustable-rate, bearing interest rates based upon the Wall Street Journal
	Prime Rate.

	We may sell a certain
	amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we
	sold $2.2 million and $3.5 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively.


	At December 31, 2016, we were servicing
	a portfolio of $18.0 million of residential mortgage loans that we had originated and sold. See “—Originations, Purchases
	and Sales of Loans.”




	 






	Commercial Real
	Estate, Multi-Family and Non-Owner Occupied Residential Lending

	.

	Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio
	and increase our yield, we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans, with a target loan size of
	$1.0 million to $1.3 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $23.4 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 11.1% of
	our total loan portfolio, $19.5 million in multi-family loans, representing 9.2% of our total loan portfolio and $26.5 million
	in non-owner occupied residential loans, representing 12.5% of our total loan portfolio.


	Subject to future economic, market
	and regulatory conditions, we intend to engage in a disciplined increase in commercial real estate, multi-family and non-owner
	occupied residential lending in our market area.


	 


	Our commercial real
	estate and multi-family loans are all adjustable-rate loans, and historically had terms of 25 years. Recently, as we have endeavored
	to customize these loans to meet the needs of our customers, they generally have initial terms of up to five years and amortization
	terms of 20 to 25 years with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial
	real estate loans and multi-family loans is generally 70% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the
	loan, subject to increase up to 75% upon the approval of the Executive Committee. Our commercial real estate loans are typically
	secured by retail, industrial, warehouse, service, medical or other commercial properties, and our multi-family loans are typically
	secured by five and six unit residential properties or apartment buildings.


	 


	We also offer mortgages
	on non-owner occupied, or “investment,” one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, which we underwrite using the
	same guidelines and standards applicable to commercial real estate and multi-family loans. These loans have terms of five to ten
	years, subject to increase up to 30 years upon approval of the Executive Committee. We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios
	of non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans to 75% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower, subject
	to an increase to 80% upon approval of the Executive Committee. These loans are all adjustable-rate loans, and require a minimum
	debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x.


	 


	We may hire additional
	experienced lenders in the future to increase our pipeline of commercial real estate, multi-family and investment property loans.
	During 2016, we also offered loans with guarantees through the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 504 Program. We
	intend to increase this activity in the future. The Section 504 Program effectively splits one loan into two, with Pilgrim Bank
	taking the first and the SBA taking the second. The reduction in loan to value provided under the Section 504 Program reduces our
	credit risk. In addition to utilizing the SBA 504 Program, we are approved as an SBA lender. We plan to participate in the SBA
	Express and SBA 7a Program for small business lending. We expect to utilize this relationship to support our efforts to diversify
	our lending into commercial and industrial lending as well as commercial real estate lending.




	 






	Construction
	and Land Lending


	. At December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of $27.2 million, or 12.9% of our total loan portfolio,
	in construction and land loans, and $12.6 million in unfunded commitments. Of these, $12.1 million in outstanding loans and $5.9
	million in unfunded commitments were for acquisition development and construction loans, $1.4 million in outstanding loans and
	$1.5 million in unfunded commitments were for non-owner occupied multi-family construction loans, $4.1 million in outstanding loans
	and $3.5 million in unfunded commitments were for one-to-four family speculative construction loans, $960,000 in outstanding loans
	and $200,000 in unfunded commitments were for commercial real estate investment construction loans, $2.1 million in outstanding
	loans and $26,000 in unfunded commitments were in one-to-four family investment loans, $2.6 million in outstanding loans and $1.2
	million in unfunded commitments were for one-to-four family owner occupied construction loans, and $4.0 million in outstanding
	loans with no unfunded commitments were loans on vacant land.

	Our owner-occupied
	residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to 12 months, during which the borrower pays interest only. Upon
	completion of construction, these loans convert to conventional amortizing mortgage loans. Our residential construction loans have
	rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio
	of our residential construction loans is generally 75% of the appraised value of the completed property. Residential construction
	loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans, except
	that all residential construction loans are appraised by independent appraisers and borrowers are generally required to exhibit
	the ability to absorb unforeseen cost overruns.


	 


	Our commercial real
	estate, multi-family, and non-owner occupied residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to 24 months depending
	on the individual project, during which the borrower pays interest only. Multi-family and non-owner occupied residential construction
	loans are renovation loans, or ground up construction loans, that either automatically convert to permanent at the end of the construction
	period or are marketed for sale. These loans, particularly non-owner occupied residential, have been a significant lending opportunity
	during recent years. Commercial real estate construction projects are typically land acquisition and development projects of single
	family units that do not automatically convert to a permanent loan. The maximum “as completed” loan-to-value for non-owner
	occupied, commercial real estate and multi-family loans is 70%, however the Executive Committee has the authority to approve an
	exception for a higher limit, if warranted. Commercial real estate, multi-family and non-owner occupied residential construction
	loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent commercial real estate, multi-family
	and non-owner occupied residential loans. All loans are appraised by independent appraisers and subject to a review by a secondary
	independent appraiser. Borrowers are generally required to absorb cost overruns and be able to carry the property until it is sold
	or leased.


	 


	To a lesser extent,
	we make loans for the speculative construction and development of one- to four-family residential lots by well-known established
	builders in our market area. These loans are originated pursuant to the same standards as, and generally have terms similar to,
	commercial construction loans. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of speculative construction and land development loans is generally
	70%. Land development loans require a 20% minimum down payment, or 40% where the development is not expected to commence immediately.


	 


	All construction and
	land development loans are appraised by independent appraisers. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance, property
	and casualty insurance, and, if the property is determined to be located in a flood zone area, flood insurance. Either the Bank
	or an independent third party inspects the properties for progress and recommends all draws, consistent with the work performed
	to date. All draws are approved by the President and Chief Executive Officer.




	 






	Commercial and
	Industrial Lending

	.

	At December 31, 2016, we had $2.9 million of commercial and industrial loans outstanding, representing
	1.4% of our total loan portfolio, and $314,000 of unfunded commitments. Our commercial and industrial loans are generally annual
	revolving loans, but we may also offer term loans with terms of five to ten years depending on the needs of the borrower. We make
	commercial and industrial loans to businesses operating in our market area for purchasing equipment, property improvements, business
	expansion or working capital. Our commercial and industrial term loans are generally secured by equipment, furniture and fixtures,
	inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, or, in very limited circumstances, may be unsecured. If a commercial and
	industrial loan is secured by equipment, we fix the maturity of a term loan at up to seven years, depending on the useful life
	of equipment purchased, the source of repayment for the loan and the purpose of the loan. Our revolving lines of credit are generally
	used to finance short-term working capital needs such as accounts payable and inventory. We generally obtain personal guarantees
	with commercial and industrial loans. As of December 31, 2016 we had $876,000 of USDA-guaranteed agricultural loans.


	 






	 



	10



	 







	 




	 


	We believe that commercial
	and industrial loans will provide growth opportunities for us, and we expect to increase, subject to our conservative underwriting
	standards and market conditions, this business line in the future.




	 





	Consumer Lending.


	At December 31, 2016, we had $1.9 million, or 0.9% of our loan portfolio, in consumer loans.
	Of these, $1.7 million were automobile loans that we purchased from a local credit union. We offer consumer loans on a very limited
	basis, and generally as a convenience to customers with whom we have banking relationships.




	 



	Originations, Purchases and Sales
	of Loans


	 


	We originate real estate
	and other loans through our loan originators, employee referrals, marketing and advertising efforts, our existing customer base,
	walk-in customers and referrals from customers, real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. All loans that we originate are underwritten
	pursuant to our policies and procedures. We may hire additional loan officers and originators to increase our residential lending
	activity, as needed.


	 


	We may sell a certain
	amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market based upon our analysis of our interest rate risk and market conditions,
	choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. In recent years we have
	sold only fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages, and have sold these loans exclusively to the Federal Home Loan Bank in conjunction
	with its Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) Program. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we sold $2.2
	million and $3.5 million, respectively, of mortgage loans, all on a servicing-retained basis. At December 31, 2016, we serviced
	$18.0 million of fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originated and sold in the secondary market.


	 


	In addition, the purchase
	of loans or participations in which we are not the lead lender, is a key element of our strategy of maintaining a high loan-to-asset
	level on our balance sheets. When we purchase loans or participations, we follow the loan underwriting and approval policies that
	apply to the origination of the type of loan being purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased a total of
	$31.0 million of residential loans, on a servicing-released basis, and $5.0 million of commercial real estate loans. At December
	31, 2016, we had $6.0 million of participations purchased, all of which were secured by real estate or USDA guarantees. We may
	also sell participation interests in loans that we originate and retain the servicing and lead position on the credit. This generally
	occurs when a loan or relationship either exceeds our lending limits or we determine that it would be prudent to reduce our credit
	risk exposure with respect to the particular relationship. At December 31, 2016, we had $6.3 million of participations sold.

	The following table
	sets forth our loan originations, purchases and principal repayment activities during the periods indicated. We originated for
	sale and sold $2.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of loans during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

	Asset Quality




	 






	Delinquency Procedures.


	When a borrower fails to make a required monthly payment on any loan in the portfolio, we attempt to contact the borrower
	to determine the reason for nonpayment and to discuss future payments. Our policies provide that collection procedures commence
	when a loan is 15 days past due. The Executive Committee reviews the delinquencies on a monthly basis and reports collection activity
	to the Board.


	 


	We generally place
	a loan on non-accrual status when it is 90 days past due. When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in
	lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated
	fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged
	to the allowance for loan losses. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal which is obtained as soon as practicable, typically
	after the foreclosure process is completed. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After
	acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of
	the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.

	Troubled Debt
	Restructurings.


	During the financial crisis, we were aggressive in our efforts to identify borrower weaknesses and to structure
	modifications to qualified borrowers in order to help them during periods of financial difficulty. These modifications were either
	temporary or permanent. Borrowers were granted modifications after a detailed analysis of their current financial situation and
	future expectations.


	We modified loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower stay current on his
	or her loan and to avoid foreclosure. We generally do not forgive principal on loans or extend the maturity on loans. We may modify
	the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates) or to provide for temporary interest-only terms,
	or to forgive or defer the payment of interest. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout
	plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. Since 2009, the Bank has modified approximately
	21 loans, primarily owner-occupied residential loans, some of which did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring.
	During 2016, we modified five loans. During 2016, three of the five modified loans paid off following restructuring. At December
	31, 2016, we had seven remaining loans totaling $4.1 million that were designated as troubled debt restructurings. Two loans designated
	as troubled debt restructurings, were classified as substandard on December 31, 2016, but were contractually performing at that
	date. Once the borrower has demonstrated sustained performance with the modified terms, the loan may be upgraded from its classified
	and / or non performing status. Any loan categorized as a troubled debt restructuring will continue to retain that designation
	through the life of the loan, even if the loan is performing under its original contractual terms.

	The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing
	assets and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated. The information reflects net charge-offs but not specific reserves.
	Troubled debt restructurings include loans that may or may not be on non-accrual status, and loans that have renegotiated loan
	terms to assist borrowers who are unable to meet the original terms of their loans, with modifications to loan terms including
	temporary or permanent reduction in interest rates (which may be at below market rates), temporary interest-only terms, or forgiveness
	or deferral the payment of interest.

	Allowance for Loan Losses





	 






	Analysis and
	Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses


	. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect
	probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly
	basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.


	 


	Our methodology for
	assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified
	impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount
	of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.


	 


	We identify loans that
	may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management
	may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower’s inability to make payments under
	the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value would result in our charging off the loan or the portion of
	the loan that was impaired.


	 


	Among other factors,
	we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness
	of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio
	as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions
	about the impact of housing depreciation.


	 


	Substantially all of
	our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general
	or specific allowances are established. Typically for a non-performing real estate loan in the process of collection, the value
	of the underlying collateral is estimated using the original independent appraisal or a new appraisal as well as other current
	estimates of value, adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors. Related general or specific reserves are adjusted
	on a quarterly basis. If a non-performing real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about
	further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will
	order a new independent appraisal. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired.




	 






	Specific Allowances
	for Identified Problem Loans


	.


	We establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss
	is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of
	the collateral less estimated selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the
	customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past
	due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral;
	and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent
	of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.




	 






	General Valuation
	Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio


	. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as
	impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been
	allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category
	and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation
	of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s
	judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in
	lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area,
	credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience
	in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied
	loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.

	(1) Includes $105,000, or 9.96% of the allowance
	for loan losses, $76,000, or 8.58% of the allowance for loan losses, $64,000, or 8.61% of the allowance for loan losses, $62,000,
	or 8.36% of allowance for loan losses, and $67,000, or 8.50% of allowance for loan losses, allocated to non-owner occupied residential
	loans at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.


	 


	At December 31, 2016,
	our allowance for loan losses represented 0.50% of total loans and there were no non-performing loans. At December 31, 2015, our
	allowance for loan losses represented 0.52% of total loans and 62.84% of non-performing loans. There were $8,000 in charge-offs
	and $1,000 in recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were $1,000 in charge-offs and no recoveries during the
	year ended December 31, 2015.


	 


	Although we believe
	that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for
	loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the
	assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with
	certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance
	are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Furthermore, as an integral part of
	its examination process, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses.
	The regulators may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of
	its examination. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results
	of the operations.

	Securities Activities





	 






	General


	.
	The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to
	help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within
	the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. In recent years, beginning with the recession which began in 2008
	and the subsequent challenging economic environment, our strategy has been to manage the maturities of our investment securities
	portfolio within our interest rate risk strategies.


	 


	Our Board of Directors
	is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors and our
	Executive Committee and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. Authority
	to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our President and Chief Executive Officer and
	our Chief Financial Officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at regularly scheduled monthly meetings of the board of directors.




	 






	U.S. Government
	and Agency Obligations.


	At December 31, 2016, we had U.S. government and agency securities with a carrying value of $8.9
	million, which constituted 52% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments
	in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral
	for borrowings and for prepayment protection.






	 






	Mortgage-Backed
	Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations


	. At December 31, 2016, we had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying
	value of $5.5 million, which constituted 32% of our securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the
	secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred
	to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through”
	to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized
	by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by
	one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities
	to investors such as Pilgrim Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to
	allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees.




	 


	Residential mortgage-backed
	securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage
	loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be
	used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments
	will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization
	of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current
	prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.




	 






	Municipal Securities.


	At December 31, 2016, we had municipal securities with a carrying value of $2.6 million, which constituted 16% of our securities
	portfolio. All of our current municipal securities are issued by municipalities in Massachusetts and have maturities not in excess
	of 15 years. These securities generally provide slightly higher yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed
	securities, but are not as liquid as such other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the
	extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio.


	 






	 



	19



	 







	 






	 






	Investment Certificates
	of Deposit With Other Institutions.


	We invest in certificates of deposit with insured financial institutions in order to
	increase yields on short-term investments and manage the maturity of our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we
	had $1.1 million in certificates of deposit with other institutions.




	 






	Federal Home
	Loan Bank Stock


	. We held common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston in connection with our borrowing activities
	totaling $2.3 million and $971,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Federal Home Loan Bank common stock is carried
	at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. We may be required to purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank stock
	if we increase borrowings in the future.




	 






	Other Securities


	.
	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $384,000 invested in The Co-operative Central Bank reserve fund. The Co-operative Central
	Bank reserve fund is an illiquid investment.


	 




	Bank-Owned Life
	Insurance


	. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations.
	Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our
	balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $2.3 million and was issued by one insurance company.

	Securities Portfolio
	Maturities and Yields


	. The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of our securities
	at December 31, 2016. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Mortgage-backed securities, including collateralized
	mortgage obligations, are anticipated to be repaid in advance of their contractual maturities as a result of projected mortgage
	loan repayments. In addition, under the structure of some of our CMOs, the short- and intermediate-term tranche interests have
	repayment priority over the longer term tranche interests of the same underlying mortgage pool. Finally, some of our U.S. Treasury
	and other securities are callable at the option of the issuer. Certain securities have interest rates that are adjustable and will
	reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules have not been reflected in the table below.

	Sources of Funds



	 




	General.


	Deposits
	have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily
	Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate
	risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities,
	loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are
	relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates,
	market conditions and levels of competition. To a lesser extent, we may utilize repurchase agreements or federal funds sold as
	funding sources.




	 






	Deposits.




	Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts,
	including noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, passbook and statement savings accounts, variable rate money
	market accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance
	required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have not in the past used, and currently
	do not hold any, internet deposits, and we do not accept deposit accounts opened on-line. In 2015, we began to use brokered deposits
	as a funding source for lending and investment activities. We have established an internal policy limit on brokered deposits as
	the lower of $20.0 million or 10% of total deposits. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, brokered deposits totaled $7.3 million, or
	4.0% and 4.3%, of total deposits, respectively. At December 31, 2016, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates
	of deposit, were $93.1 million, representing 51.1% of total deposits.


	 


	In recent years, we
	have relied for deposit generation on promotional programs and advertising efforts, our reputation in the community for superior
	customer service, the variety of deposit accounts that we offer, our competitive rates, customer referrals, and cross-marketing
	efforts with loan customers. We may use promotional rates to meet asset/liability and market segment goals. We intend to continue
	to focus on increasing our core deposits by providing incentives on new transaction accounts, enhanced online services and mobile
	banking, and by leveraging commercial lending relationships to increase transaction accounts.


	 


	Interest rates, maturity
	terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on
	current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of
	deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of
	deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in
	our customers’ demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes
	numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source
	of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including
	competition and prevailing interest rates as consumers become more conscious of interest rates.

	Borrowings.




	We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLB) upon the security of certain
	of our mortgage loans and investment securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each
	of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than
	our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $37.3 million and $8.5 million,
	respectively, in outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, based on available collateral and our ownership of FHLB
	stock, we had access to additional FHLB advances of up to $52.0 million.

	REGULATION AND SUPERVISION




	 




	General




	 



	Pilgrim Bank is a Massachusetts
	stock co-operative bank and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, which is a registered
	bank holding company. Pilgrim Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and by the Share Insurance
	Fund of the Co-Operative Central Bank of Massachusetts for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Pilgrim Bank is subject
	to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal
	regulator and deposit insurer. Pilgrim Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the
	Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior
	to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions.
	Pilgrim Bank must comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Pilgrim Bank
	also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal
	Home Loan Bank System.


	 


	As a bank holding company,
	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal
	Reserve Board. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	under the federal securities laws.


	 






	 



	24



	 







	 




	  


	The regulatory and
	supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily
	for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors.
	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement
	activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification
	of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements
	and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve
	Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of Pilgrim Bancshares,
	Inc. and Pilgrim Bank. As is further described below, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank
	Act”) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and may affect the lending, investment and general operating
	activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.


	 


	Set forth below are
	certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Pilgrim Bank and Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. This description of statutes
	and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Pilgrim Bank
	and Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies,
	could have a material adverse impact on Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc., Pilgrim Bank and their operations.



	 




	Dodd-Frank Act



	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act
	made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank
	Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions.
	The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent
	as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted
	to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation
	also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon
	passage and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance
	sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.


	 


	During 2015, The Federal
	Reserve Board amended its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (the “Policy Statement”). Pursuant to the Policy
	Statement, the Basel III capital rules do not apply to bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in total assets that meet
	certain criteria. As Pilgrim Bancshares Inc., meets the criteria specified in the Policy Statement, the Company is not subject
	to regulatory capital requirements on a consolidated basis.


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act
	created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer
	Financial Protection Bureau has extensive rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all
	banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial
	Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion
	in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable
	bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations,
	and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Act
	broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible
	equity capital of a financial institution, rather than on total deposits. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum
	amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased
	stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation
	and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules
	prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded
	or not. Further, the legislation mandated regulations requiring that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the
	risk for transferred loans, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained
	a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.


	 






	 



	25



	 







	 




	  


	The Dodd-Frank Act
	also required the Consumer Financial Protection Board to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination
	as to a prospective borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. The final “Ability to Repay” rules,
	which were effective January 10, 2014, establish a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor for loans whose terms and features
	are deemed to make the loan less risky.


	 


	Many provisions of
	the Dodd-Frank Act involve delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations or have not been issued in final form.
	Their impact on our operations cannot yet fully be assessed. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act
	will result in an increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for Pilgrim Bank and Pilgrim Bancshares,
	Inc.


	 



	Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision



	 




	General.


	As a Massachusetts-chartered co-operative bank, Pilgrim Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts
	Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers,
	lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment
	of dividends. In addition, Pilgrim Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations.
	The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks or the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation is required for a Massachusetts-chartered
	bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities.
	Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner
	of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a bank who have
	violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests,
	or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to
	appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner,
	and under certain other circumstances.


	 


	Massachusetts regulations
	generally allow Massachusetts banks to, with appropriate regulatory approvals, engage in activities permissible for federally chartered
	banks or banks chartered by another state. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks also has adopted procedures reducing regulatory
	burdens and expense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and well-managed banks.


	 


	In 2015, the Commonwealth
	of Massachusetts adopted a law modernizing the Massachusetts banking law, which affords Massachusetts chartered banks with greater
	flexibility compared to federally chartered and out-of-state banks.




	 






	Lending Activities.


	A Massachusetts-chartered co-operative bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate
	loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative
	loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans
	may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be
	made with or without security.




	 








	 



	26



	 







	 








	 






	Insurance Sales.


	Massachusetts banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a
	plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A bank
	may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Pilgrim Bank
	does not sell or refer insurance products, and has not sought approval for insurance sales activities.


	 




	Dividends.


	A Massachusetts co-operative bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Non-cash dividends
	may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. A Massachusetts
	co-operative bank with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks,
	declare dividends on the common stock without also declaring dividends on the preferred stock. The approval of the Massachusetts
	Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits
	for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund
	for the retirement of any preferred stock. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations
	plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued
	dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. Dividends from Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. may depend, in part,
	upon receipt of dividends from Pilgrim Bank. The payment of dividends from Pilgrim Bank would be restricted by federal law if the
	payment of such dividends resulted in Pilgrim Bank failing to meet regulatory capital requirements.




	 






	Parity Regulation.


	A Massachusetts bank may, in accordance with Massachusetts law and regulations issued by the Massachusetts Commissioner
	of Banks, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks
	in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically
	prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on
	the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. Beginning in April 2015, a Massachusetts
	bank must provide the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks advance written notice prior to engaging in certain activities permissible
	for national banks, federal thrifts, or out-of-state banks.




	 






	Loans to One
	Borrower Limitations.


	Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions,
	total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20% of the total of the bank’s capital stock.




	 






	Loans to a Bank’s
	Insiders.


	Massachusetts banking laws currently prohibit any executive officer or director of a bank from borrowing or guaranteeing
	extensions of credit by such bank except for any of the following loans or extensions of credit with the approval of a majority
	of the board of directors: (i) loans or extension of credit, secured or unsecured, to an officer of the bank in an amount
	not exceeding $100,000; (ii) loans or extensions of credit intended or secured for educational purposes to an officer of the
	bank in an amount not exceeding $200,000; (iii) loans or extensions of credit secured by a mortgage on residential real estate
	to be occupied in whole or in part by the officer to whom the loan or extension of credit is made, in an amount not exceeding $750,000;
	and (iv) loans or extensions of credit to a director of the bank who is not also an officer of the bank in an amount permissible
	under the bank’s loan to one borrower limit. No such loan or extension of credit may be granted with an interest rate or
	other terms that are preferential in comparison to loans granted to persons not affiliated with the bank.


	 


	Beginning in April
	2015, Massachusetts law provides that a Massachusetts bank shall comply with Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. See “—Federal
	Banking Regulation—Transactions with Related Parties.”




	 






	Investment Activities.


	In general, Massachusetts-chartered co-operative banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under
	the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the
	aggregate, exceed 4% of the bank’s deposits. Federal law imposes additional restrictions on Pilgrim Bank’s investment
	activities. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—Business Activities.”


	 






	 



	27



	 







	 




	  




	Regulatory Enforcement
	Authority.


	Any Massachusetts co-operative bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives
	of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including revocation of its charter.
	The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated
	the law, conducted the bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent
	in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts
	Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Massachusetts Commissioner
	of Banks also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions such as conducting
	business in an unsafe, unsound and or unauthorized manner. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes
	applicable to Pilgrim Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions,
	including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations
	of those statutes.


	 




	Co-Operative
	Central Bank and Share Insurance Fund.


	All Massachusetts-chartered co-operative banks are required to be members of the
	Co-Operative Central Bank, which maintains the Share Insurance Fund that insures co-operative bank deposits in excess of federal
	deposit insurance coverage. The Co-Operative Central Bank is authorized to charge co-operative banks an annual assessment fee on
	deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. Assessment rates are based on the institution’s risk category,
	similar to the method currently used to determine assessments by the FDIC discussed below under “—Federal Banking Regulation—Insurance
	of Deposit Accounts.”


	 




	Protection of
	Personal Information.


	Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements
	are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require organizations to establish written information
	security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially
	for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices.


	 


	Massachusetts has other
	statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below.


	 



	Federal Banking Regulation





	 






	Business Activities.


	Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including co-operative banks, have been limited in their activities
	as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law.
	Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered co-operative banks may, with FDIC approval,
	continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the
	shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is the
	lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law. Such grandfathered authority may be terminated
	under certain circumstances including a change in charter or a determination by the FDIC that such investments pose a safety and
	soundness risk.


	 


	The FDIC is also authorized
	to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary
	equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do
	not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions
	seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may
	control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial
	subsidiary,” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.

	Capital Requirements.


	The FDIC requires federally-insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“state non-member
	banks”) to meet minimum capital standards: a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, a 6% Tier 1
	to risk-weighted assets ratio, a 4% Tier 1 capital to total average assets leverage ratio, and a 8% total capital to risk-weighted
	assets ratio.


	 


	As noted, the risk-based
	capital standard requires the maintenance of common capital (also referred to as common equity Tier 1 capital), core capital (also
	referred to as Tier 1 capital) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted
	assets of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance
	sheet exposures, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 1,250%, assigned by the regulations, based on the risks believed
	inherent in the type of asset. Core or Tier 1 capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings),
	certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries,
	less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. Common equity Tier 1 capital adjusts
	core or Tier 1 capital for several types of deferred tax assets and liabilities and significant investments in unconsolidated financial
	institutions. The components of supplementary capital (also referred to as Tier 2 capital) include cumulative preferred stock,
	long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the
	allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains
	on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital
	included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, an institution that retains credit risk in
	connection with an asset sale is required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against
	the institution. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric
	factors, but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations
	where necessary. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Pilgrim Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.




	 






	Capital Rule.


	Effective January 1, 2015 (with a phase-in period of two to four years for certain components), the Bank became subject to
	the capital regulations adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and the FDIC, which
	implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulations require a common
	equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0% a minimum
	total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common
	stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable adjustments and deductions. Under prompt corrective action regulations, in order
	to be considered “well capitalized,” the Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% and a Tier 1 risk based capital
	ratio of 8.0%, a total risk based capital ratio of 10.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the regulations establish
	a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that phases in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted
	assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is fully phased in at 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2016,
	failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer limits the ability of the Bank and the Company to pay dividends, repurchase
	shares or pay discretionary bonuses.


	 


	A state non-member
	bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required by the FDIC’s
	regulatory capital regulations or for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. Pilgrim
	Bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited by the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which limit
	the ability of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends to its stockholders.

	Community Reinvestment
	Act and Fair Lending Laws.


	All institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”)
	and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection
	with its examination of a state non-member bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with
	the CRA. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s
	discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent
	with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a non-member bank, to assess the institution’s
	record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications
	by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to
	provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. An institution’s
	failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as
	branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The CRA requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose
	their rating. Pilgrim Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent federal examination.


	 


	Massachusetts has its
	own statutory counterpart to the CRA that is applicable to Pilgrim Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the
	CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to
	consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by
	the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire
	the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Pilgrim Bank’s most recent rating under Massachusetts
	law was “Satisfactory.”


	 


	In addition, the Equal
	Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of
	characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act
	could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.




	 






	Transactions
	with Related Parties.


	An institution’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections
	23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common
	control with an insured depository institution such as Pilgrim Bank. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. will be an affiliate of Pilgrim Bank
	because of its control of Pilgrim Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are
	subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. Transactions with affiliates also must be consistent with safe
	and sound banking practices, generally not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to
	the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.


	 


	Pilgrim Bank’s
	authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such
	persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the
	Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:


	 







	·



	be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures
	that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve
	more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and




	 







	·



	not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and
	in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Pilgrim Bank’s capital.




	 






	 



	30



	 







	 






	 


	In addition, extensions
	of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Pilgrim Bank’s loan committee or board of directors. Extensions
	of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.




	 






	Enforcement.


	The FDIC has extensive enforcement responsibility over state non-member banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against
	all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants
	who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement
	action by the FDIC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors
	of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions,
	and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million
	per day. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank
	if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the
	date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator
	or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial
	dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or
	unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially
	all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. The FDIC also has
	the authority to terminate deposit insurance.


	 




	Standards for
	Safety and Soundness.


	Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository
	institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation,
	credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as
	the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies
	use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal
	banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the
	institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet
	these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan.
	Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or
	the imposition of civil money penalties.




	 






	Interstate Banking
	and Branching.


	Federal law permits well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state,
	subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks
	are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, recent amendments
	made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish

	de novo

	branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is
	authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state.




	 






	Prompt Corrective
	Action Regulations

	.

	The FDIC is required by law to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under
	its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital.


	 


	Under prompt corrective
	action regulations, in order to be considered “well capitalized,” the Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%,
	a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. An institution
	that has a CET1 risk based capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio less than 6.0%, a total risk based capital
	ratio less than 8.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4.0%, is considered to be undercapitalized. An institution that has
	a CET1 risk based capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio less than 4.0%, a total risk based capital ratio
	less than 6.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 3.0%, is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” An
	institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”
	In addition, the regulations established a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that phased in beginning
	January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is fully phased in at 2.5% effective
	January 1, 2019


	 








	 



	31



	 







	 




	 


	Generally, a receiver
	or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames.
	The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date that an institution
	is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically
	undercapitalized.” Any holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee
	performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was deemed to
	be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee
	remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four
	consecutive calendar quarters.


	Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such
	as a restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory
	actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive
	officers and directors.


	 





	Insurance
	of Deposit Accounts.


	The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such
	as

	Pilgrim Bank. Deposit accounts in Pilgrim Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately
	insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions
	premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.


	 


	Under the FDIC’s
	risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations,
	regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain
	specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments are
	based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of total deposits. Assessment
	rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 1/2 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total
	assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more
	than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change,
	required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits.


	 


	In addition to the
	FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the
	FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize
	the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.
	For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the annualized FICO assessment was less than 1 basis point of total assets less tangible
	capital.



	 



	The Dodd-Frank Act
	increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured
	deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion
	or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the
	discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion
	by establishing a long range fund of 2.0%.


	 


	The FDIC has authority
	to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results
	of operations of Pilgrim Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.


	 








	 



	32



	 







	 




	 


	Insurance of deposits
	may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
	unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the
	FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.




	 






	Prohibitions
	Against Tying Arrangements

	.

	State non-member banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to
	or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition
	that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor
	of the institution.




	 






	Federal Reserve
	System.


	Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against
	their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require
	that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating
	$89.0 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater
	than $89.0 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%).
	The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from
	the reserve requirements. Pilgrim Bank is in compliance with these requirements.




	 






	Federal Home
	Loan Bank System.


	Pilgrim Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal
	Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well
	as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Pilgrim Bank is required
	to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2016, Pilgrim Bank was in compliance
	with this requirement. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value
	and is carried at cost. Pilgrim Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the Federal
	Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. As of December 31, 2016, no impairment has been recognized.


	 


	At its discretion,
	the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston may declare dividends on its stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds
	for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contributing funds for affordable housing
	programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result
	in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. As a result of losses incurred,
	the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston suspended and did not pay dividends in 2009 and 2010. However, the Federal Home Loan Bank
	of Boston resumed payment of quarterly dividends in 2011 equal to an annual yield of 0.30% and continued to pay quarterly dividends
	in 2012 equal to an annual yield of 0.50%, in 2013 equal to an annual yield of 0.38%, in 2014 equal to an annual yield of 1.49%,
	in 2015 equal to an annual yield of 2.41%, and in 2016 equal to an annual yield of 2.86%. There can be no assurance that such dividends
	will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal
	Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock held by Pilgrim Bank.



	 




	Other Regulations



	 


	Interest and other
	charges collected or contracted for by Pilgrim Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.

	Holding Company Regulation





	 






	General

	.

	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As such, Pilgrim
	Bancshares, Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting
	requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Pilgrim
	Bancshares, Inc. and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict
	or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary institution.




	 






	Permissible Activities.


	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act
	of 1956, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is required to obtain the prior approval of the
	Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve
	Board approval also is required for Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities
	of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of
	any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire depository
	institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects
	of the company and institutions involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the
	convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior
	approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank
	acquisition can be completed.


	 


	A bank holding company
	is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the
	voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for
	activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper
	incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely
	related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing
	discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real
	property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring
	a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.
	A bank holding company that meets certain criteria, such as being well-capitalized and well-managed within the meaning of applicable
	regulations, may elect to become a “financial holding company.” Such an election allows a bank holding company to engage
	in a broader array of financial activities, including insurance and investment banking.




	 






	Capital.


	When it reaches $1 billion in total assets, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. will be subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital
	adequacy regulations for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis). These capital standards have historically been similar
	to, though less stringent than, those of the FDIC for Pilgrim Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board
	to establish, for all bank holding companies with total assets of $1 billion or more, minimum consolidated capital requirements
	that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Under regulations recently enacted by the Federal
	Reserve Board and effective January 1, 2015, all such bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements that
	are the same as the new capital requirements for Pilgrim Bank. These new capital requirements include provisions that, when applicable,
	might limit the ability of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends to its stockholders or repurchase its shares. See “—Federal
	Banking Regulation—New Capital Rule.”

	Source of Strength.


	The Dodd-Frank Act codified the “source of strength” doctrine. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations
	requiring that all bank holding companies serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks by providing
	capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.


	 




	Dividends.


	The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common
	stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and
	only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital
	needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect
	to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net
	of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or
	earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a bank
	holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary institution becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also
	states that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing
	common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase
	or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding
	compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect
	the ability of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.




	 






	Acquisition.




	Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including
	a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a bank holding company. Under
	certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the
	company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control
	of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding
	voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete
	notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and
	the competitive effects of the acquisition.


	 




	Massachusetts
	Holding Company Regulation.


	Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions,
	including a co-operative bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term “company” is defined by the Massachusetts
	banking laws similarly to the definition of “company” under the Bank Holding Company Act. Each Massachusetts bank holding
	company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions,
	such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register and file reports
	with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.



	 




	Federal Securities Laws



	 


	Pilgrim Bancshares,
	Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

	Emerging Growth Company Status




	 



	The Jumpstart Our Business
	Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities
	laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0
	billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Pilgrim Bancshares,
	Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.


	 


	An “emerging
	growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred
	to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to
	as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors
	attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure
	regarding executive compensation; however, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement
	or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities
	and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally,
	an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company,
	but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable
	during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. has elected to comply with new or amended accounting
	pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.


	 


	A company loses emerging
	growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross
	revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date
	of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
	Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in
	non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities
	and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).


	 


	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002


	 


	The Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced
	and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
	Officer will be required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact.
	The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having
	these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our
	internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board
	of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual
	reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other
	factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We are subject to further reporting and audit requirements
	under the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have implemented policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance
	with these regulations.

	TAXATION




	 




	Federal Taxation





	 






	General.


	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations,
	with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal
	income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank.




	 






	Method of Accounting



	.

	For federal income tax purposes, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual
	method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31st for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small
	Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the percentage method of accounting for bad debt reserves by banks and savings
	institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995.




	 






	Minimum Tax.


	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable
	income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax
	is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general,
	offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits
	against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2016, Pilgrim Bank had no minimum tax credit carryforward.




	 






	Corporate Dividends.


	We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Pilgrim Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.




	 






	Audit of Tax
	Returns.


	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.’s and Pilgrim Bank’s federal income tax returns, including tax returns of
	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.’s predecessors, have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.


	 


	State Taxation


	 


	Massachusetts generally
	requires corporations engaged in a unitary business to calculate their income on a combined basis with corporations which are under
	common control. Accordingly, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank currently file combined annual income tax returns.


	 


	A financial institution
	or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security corporation” under Massachusetts
	law provided that: (a) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not
	as a broker; and (b) it has applied for, and received, classification as a “security corporation” by the Commissioner
	of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A security corporation that is not a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue
	Code must pay a tax equal to 1.32% of its gross income.


	 


	Pilgrim Bank, under
	current law, files a Massachusetts combined excise tax return with its affiliates who do not qualify as security corporations.
	During the 2016 tax year, Pilgrim Bank was subject to an annual Massachusetts tax at a rate of 9.0% of its net income, adjusted
	for certain items. Massachusetts net income is defined as gross income, other than 95% of dividends received in any taxable year
	beginning on or after January 1, 1999 from or on account of the ownership of any class of stock if the institution owns 15% or
	more of the voting stock of the institution paying the dividend, less the deductions, but not the credits allowable under the provisions
	of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect for the taxable year. The dividends must meet the qualifications under Massachusetts
	law. Dividends paid to affiliates participating in a combined return will be 100% excluded to the extent paid from earnings and
	profits of a unitary business included in the Massachusetts combined return. Deductions with respect to the following items, however,
	shall not be allowed except as otherwise provided: (a) dividends received, except as otherwise provided; (b) losses sustained in
	other taxable years; (c) taxes on or measured by income, franchise taxes measured by net income, franchise taxes for the privilege
	of doing business and capital stock taxes imposed by any state; or (d) the deduction allowed by section 168(k) of the Code

	.



	 








	 



	38



	 







	 




	 


	Other applicable state
	taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes. None of the state tax returns of
	Pilgrim Bank is currently under audit, nor have any of these tax returns been audited during the past five years.


	 


	As a Maryland business
	corporation, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees to the State of Maryland.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations





	 


	This section is intended
	to help potential investors understand the financial performance of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries through a discussion
	of the factors affecting our financial condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and our results of operations for the
	years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
	statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



	 




	Critical Accounting
	Policies



	 


	Certain of our accounting
	policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or
	subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies
	are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect
	these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes
	in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 2 of the Notes to
	Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


	 








	 



	43



	 







	 




	 


	The recently enacted
	JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As
	an “emerging growth company” we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised
	accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly,
	our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised
	accounting standards.


	 


	Management views critical
	accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where
	changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Management
	currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses and deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies.




	 






	Allowance for
	Loan Losses.


	The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent
	in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged
	to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material
	estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted
	loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these
	estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision
	for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors
	related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish
	the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially
	from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process,
	periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments
	about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased
	provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.



	 




	Deferred Tax
	Assets

	.



	We use the asset and liability method of
	accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
	attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
	tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
	years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
	allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant
	judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of


	the resulting tax liabilities
	and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining
	our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors
	change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax
	assets.



	 


	Comparison of Financial Condition
	at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	 




	Total Assets.


	Total assets increased $42.4 million, or 20.2%, to $252.9 million at December 31, 2016 from $210.5 million at December
	31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net loans of $40.1 million.




	 






	Cash and Cash
	Equivalents.


	Total cash and cash equivalents increased $518,000, or 4.9%, to $11.2 million at December 31, 2016 from $10.7
	million at December 31, 2015.

	Net Loans.


	Net
	loans increased $40.1 million, or 23.5%, to $210.5 million at December 31, 2016 from $170.4 million at December 31, 2015. One-
	to- four-family residential real estate loans increased $29.1 million, or 27.7%, to $134.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $104.9
	million at December 31, 2015, multifamily loans increased $2.9 million, or 17.8%, to $19.5 million at December 31, 2016 from $16.6
	million at December 31, 2015, and construction loans increased $8.4 million, or 45.0%, to $27.2 million at December 31, 2016 from
	$18.8 million at December 31, 2015. Commercial real estate loans increased $1.6 million, or 7.0%, to $23.4 million at December
	31, 2016 from $21.8 million at December 31, 2015, commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.0 million, or 27.2%, to $2.9 million
	at December 31, 2016 from $4.0 million at December 31, 2015, and home equity loans and lines of credit increased $201,000, or 9.6%,
	to $2.3 million at December 31, 2016 from $2.1 million at December 31, 2015. The Company originated $66.5 million and purchased
	$35.7 million of new loans during 2016. Partially offsetting the loan originations and purchases were $50.7 million of loan payoffs
	and amortizations, and $11.3 million of unadvanced funds on 2016 originations.


	 




	Investment Securities.


	Investment securities classified as available-for-sale increased $485,000, or 2.9%, to $17.0 million at December 31, 2016
	from $16.6 million at December 31, 2015, due to purchases of securities. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity decreased
	$16,000, or 13.3%, to $104,000 at December 31, 2016 from $120,000 at December 31, 2015 due to payments. At December 31, 2016, investment
	securities classified as available-for-sale consisted primarily of debt securities issued by U.S. government corporations and agencies,
	debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions, and government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, with a focus
	on suitable government-sponsored securities to augment risk-based capital.


	 




	Bank Owned Life
	Insurance.


	Bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2016 increased $38,000, or 1.7%, compared to December 31, 2015 due
	to normal increases in cash surrender value.


	 




	Deposits.


	Deposits
	increased $12.7 million, or 7.5%, to $182.1 million at December 31, 2016 from $169.4 million at December 31, 2015. During the year
	ended December 31, 2016, demand deposits increased $3.5 million, or 22.9%, to $18.8 million from $15.3 million, NOW account deposits
	decreased $1.1 million, or 4.9%, to $21.2 million from $22.3 million, savings accounts increased $1.5 million, or 7.5%, to $21.3
	million from $19.8 million, money market accounts increased $3.1 million, or 10.9%, to $31.8 million from $28.7 million, while
	certificates of deposit increased $5.7 million, or 6.9%, to $89.0 million from $83.2 million. Core deposits, which we consider
	to be our noninterest demand accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts, increased $7.0 million, or 8.1%,
	to $93.1 million at December 31, 2016 from $86.1 million at December 31, 2015. The growth in certificates of deposit resulted from
	the use of a listing service and various promotional campaigns designed to attract new customers to the bank.


	 




	Borrowings and
	Other Liabilities.


	Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $28.8 million, or 339.2%, to $37.3 million at December 31,
	2016 from $8.5 million at December 31, 2015. Other liabilities, which include interest payable, accruals for employee benefits
	and medical plans, income taxes payable and normal accruals for expenses, increased $205,000, or 30.8%, to $871,000 at December
	31, 2016 from $666,000 at December 31, 2015.


	 




	Total Stockholders’
	Equity.






	Total stockholders’ equity increased $678,000, or 2.1%,
	to $32.6 million at December 31, 2016 from $32.0 million at December 31, 2015. The increase resulted from $1.0 million of net
	income for the year ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by $550,000 of shares repurchased during the year ended December
	31, 2016.

	Comparison of Results of Operations
	for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015




	 






	General.


	The Company realized net income of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $654,000 for the
	year ended December 31, 2015. The improvement in net income was primarily driven by a 20.8% increase in average earnings assets
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 versus average earning assets for the year ended 2015.




	 






	Interest and
	Dividend Income.


	On a tax-equivalent basis, total interest and dividend income increased $1.3 million, or 19.0%, to $8.2
	million for 2016 from $6.9 million for 2015. Interest on loans increased $1.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily driven
	by higher levels of average loans. The average balance of loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $33.1 million
	to $191.9 million from $158.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The average yield on loans decreased 5 basis points
	to 4.11% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 4.16% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance of lower yielding,
	interest-bearing deposits increased $1.2 million to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $9.6 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2015. The yield on investment securities (on a tax-equivalent basis) decreased 48 basis points to 1.56%
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The total earning asset yield decreased 6
	basis points to 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 3.78% for the year ended December 31, 2015.




	 






	Interest Expense.


	Total interest expense increased $496,000, or 45.7%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million in
	2015. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposit accounts increased $352,000, or 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
	The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 0.74% for the year
	ended December 31, 2015. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $22.4 million, or 16.2%, to $161.1 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $138.7. million for the year ended December 31, 2015.


	 


	Interest expense on
	Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances increased $144,000 to $209,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $65,000 for
	the year ended December 31, 2015. The average balance of FHLB advances increased $12.9 million to $21.5 million for 2016 from $8.6
	million for 2015. The cost increased 21 basis points to 0.97% for 2016 from 0.76% for 2015.




	 






	Net Interest
	and Dividend Income

	.

	On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest and dividend income increased $819,000 or 14.0%, for the year
	ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase resulted from a $1.3 million increase in interest income
	partially offset by a $496,000 increase in interest expense. Average interest-earning assets increased to $221.5 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2016 from $183.4 million for 2015, and our net interest rate spread contracted 19 basis points to 2.85%
	for 2016 from 3.04% for 2015. Our net interest margin contracted to 3.01% for 2016 from 3.19% for 2015. The decline of our interest
	rate spread and net interest margin was primarily driven by decreasing rates on earning assets and increasing rates on interest
	bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 






	Provision for
	Loan Losses.


	Based on our analysis of the factors described in “Critical Accounting Policies—Allowance for
	Loan Losses,” we recorded a provision for loan losses of $170,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a provision of
	$144,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses was $1.0 million, or 0.50% of total loans at December
	31, 2016 and $886,000, or 0.52% of total loans at December 31, 2015. There were no non-performing loans at December 31, 2016 compared
	to $1.4 million at December 31, 2015. As a percentage of non-performing loans, the allowance for loan losses was not measurable
	at December 31, 2016 and was 62.8% at December 31, 2015. Total classified loans were $573,000 at December 31, 2016 compared to
	$4.5 million at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate we believe to be appropriate to cover incurred
	probable losses, which were inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

	Noninterest income decreased $35,000, or 5.9%, to $562,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $597,000 for the year ended
	December 31, 2015. The decline was primarily driven by lower levels of loan gains. The net gain on sales of loans was $43,000 for
	the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $64,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Service charges on deposit accounts
	were $105,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $120,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.




	 






	Noninterest Expense.


	Noninterest


	expense increased $279,000 to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5.2 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the salaries and employee benefits expense which increased $263,000.




	 






	Income Taxes.


	Income tax expense was $502,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $365,000 for the year ended December 31,
	2015. The effective tax rate as a percent of pre-tax income was 33.3% and 35.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2016 was due to a $92,000 reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance.
	We performed an evaluation of our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In making the determination whether
	a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized, we seek to evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including
	the possibility of future reversals of existing taxable temporary


	differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning
	strategies and recent financial results. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount
	of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not
	be realized. Based on projected taxable income at December 31, 2016 our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by $92,000
	to $37,000 at December 31, 2016 from $129,000 at December 31, 2015. The remaining $37,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance
	at December 31, 2016, relates to the $218,000 write-down of our mutual fund investment managed by Shay Financial. At December 31,
	2015, $83,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to uncertainty regarding the utilization of the $725,000 charitable
	contribution to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation. The deferred tax asset related to the charitable contribution expires during the year
	ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $46,000 of our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015 related to the $218,000 write-down
	of our mutual fund investment managed by Shay Financial. As a result of the termination of this mutual fund investment in January
	2014, we must generate future capital gains in order to utilize this portion of our deferred tax asset, which expires during the
	year ending December 31, 2019.

	Average Balances and Yields



	 


	The following table
	sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. Tax-equivalent
	yield adjustments have been made because we had tax-free interest-earning assets during the years. All average balances are daily
	average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields
	set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income
	or interest expense.

	Rate/Volume Analysis



	 


	The following table
	presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows
	the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable
	to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For
	purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately
	based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

	Management of Market
	Risk





	 






	General.


	Our
	asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary
	source of earnings.


	 


	Over the past several
	years, management has implemented an asset/liability strategy to manage, subject to our profitability goals, our interest rate
	risk. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:


	 







	·



	originating commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, all of which tend to have
	shorter terms and higher interest rates than one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships
	that can result in larger noninterest bearing checking accounts;




	 







	·



	selectively selling the majority of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate
	and retaining all of the adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that we originate;




	 







	·



	lengthening the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies
	and through longer-term wholesale funding sources such as fixed-rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston;




	 







	·



	increasing our generation of core deposits to support lending and investment activity;




	 








	 



	49



	 







	 




	 







	·



	investing in shorter- to medium-term investment securities; and




	 







	·



	increasing noninterest income as a percentage of total income to decrease our reliance on net interest
	margin and interest rate spread.




	 


	Our board of directors
	is responsible for the review and oversight of our asset/liability committee

	. This c

	ommittee


	is charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and meets at least quarterly to review pricing
	and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly
	basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates,

	given our business strategy, operating
	environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved
	by the Board of Directors. In addition, we regularly perform a “gap analysis” of the discrepancy between the repricing
	of our assets and liabilities.





	 






	Net Interest
	Income Analysis.


	We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model
	which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn
	on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such
	as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates.
	We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also
	estimate the impact over a two year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the
	one-year period beginning January 1, 2017 resulting from potential changes in interest rates.

	The
	model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +400bp to -400bp, although we believe a decline of greater than -100bp is currently
	improbable.

	These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment
	speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no
	simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. Although the net interest
	income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are
	not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income
	and will differ from actual results.

	The calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve.




	 


	Certain shortcomings
	are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value requires
	making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market
	interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-

	sensitive

	assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a
	particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific
	assets and liabilities. The tables also do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes
	in general interest rates. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular
	point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest
	rates on our economic value of equity and will differ from actual results.

	Net
	Present Value of Equity Analysis.


	In order to monitor and manage interest rate risk, we also use the net present value
	of equity at risk (“NPV”) methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected
	cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve in increments
	of 100 basis point (bp) rate movements.

	A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one
	percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the “Change in
	Interest Rates” column below.

	The model is run at least quarterly showing shocks from +300bp
	to -100bp, because a decline of greater than -100bp is currently improbable. The board of directors and management review the methodology’s
	measurements on a quarterly basis.



	 


	The
	interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management’s view of future market
	movements. Results of the modeling are used to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may influence
	our earnings. Modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is decidedly reliant on numerous assumptions embedded
	in the model. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, management’s best assessment of the effect of changing interest
	rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines
	offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are
	inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict
	the impact of fluctuations in interest rate on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to
	timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions. Assumptions are supported with
	annual back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.


	 


	The table below sets
	forth, as of December 31, 2016, the estimated changes in the net present value of equity that would result from the designated
	changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for Pilgrim Bank. Computations of prospective
	effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates,
	loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.

	a 10.84% increase in net portfolio value. In the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would
	experience a 14.06% decrease in net portfolio value.

	Depending
	on the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions and consumer preference, we may place greater
	emphasis on maximizing our net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities.
	We believe that the increased net income which may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or re-pricing of our
	assets and liabilities can, during periods of declining or stable interest rates, provide sufficient returns to justify an increased
	exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. We believe that our level of interest rate risk is acceptable using
	this approach.


	 


	We do not engage in
	hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives,
	such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped
	mortgage backed securities.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources


	 


	Our primary sources
	of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from
	maturities and calls of securities, maturities of certificate of deposit investments and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. While
	maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments
	are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term
	investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending,
	and investing activities during any given period.


	 


	Our cash flows are
	comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December
	31, 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations,
	the purchase of securities and the purchase of time deposits with other banks, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds
	from the sale of securities, proceeds from redemption of time deposits and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed
	securities, was $41.9 million and $30.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During
	the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased $7.2 million and sold $1.2 million in securities held as available-for-sale, and
	during the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased $8.6 million and sold $428,000 in securities held as available-for-sale.
	Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of the activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances for
	2016 and 2015, was $41.0 million and $21.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.


	 


	At December 31, 2016,
	we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized with a tier 1 leverage capital level of
	$23.4 million, or 9.4% of average assets, which is above the required level of $12.5 million, or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital
	of $24.4 million, or 14.6% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of $16.8 million, or 10.0%. Management is
	not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.


	 


	At December 31, 2016,
	we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $6.0 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $20.6 million. We anticipate
	that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are
	scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2016 totaled $47.8 million. Management expects, based on historical
	experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion
	of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract
	new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.

	Off-Balance Sheet
	Arrangements.



	In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions
	that, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions
	involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage
	customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit.



	 


	We have not engaged
	in any other off-balance sheet transactions in the normal course of our lending activities.

	(a)           


	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures.


	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
	management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of
	the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
	promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s
	management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded
	that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


	 


	(b)           


	Management’s Annual
	Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.


	Manage-ment of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	The Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
	and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
	transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
	as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
	and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


	 








	 



	53



	 







	 




	 


	Because of its inherent
	limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
	of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
	or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management, including
	the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
	of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on such
	assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
	is effective, based on those criteria.


	 


	This annual report
	does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent
	registered public accounting firm pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that permit the Company to provide only management’s
	report in this annual report.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM


	 


	The Board of Directors and Stockholders


	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.


	Cohasset, Massachusetts


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated
	balance sheets of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related
	consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then
	ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
	opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial
	statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	lines in the consolidated statements of income as follows: the pre-tax amount is included in gain on sales/calls of securities,
	net; the tax expense amount which was $11,000 and $10,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included
	in income tax expense. The after tax amount included in net income was $19,000 and $19,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016
	and 2015.

	PILGRIM BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY



	 





	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 



	For the Years Ended December 31, 2016
	and 2015



	 



	NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS



	 


	Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company”),
	was incorporated in February 2014 under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Company owns all of the outstanding shares of common
	stock of Pilgrim Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank is a Massachusetts chartered stock bank which was incorporated in 1916
	and is headquartered in Cohasset, Massachusetts. The Bank operates its business from three banking offices located in Massachusetts.
	The Bank is engaged principally in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits in
	residential and commercial real estate loans, and in commercial, consumer and small business loans. The Bank is subject to the
	regulations of, and periodic examination by, the Massachusetts Division of Banks (“DOB”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation (“the FDIC”).


	 



	NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 



	The accounting and reporting policies of
	the Company and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and predominant
	practices within the banking industry. The consolidated financial statements were prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.
	The significant accounting policies are summarized below to assist the reader in better understanding the consolidated financial
	statements and other data contained herein.


	 


	USE OF ESTIMATES:


	 



	In
	preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
	of the date of the consolidated balance sheets and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
	results could differ from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate
	to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of deferred tax assets.



	 


	BASIS OF PRESENTATION:


	 


	The consolidated financial statements include
	the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, 48 South
	Main Street Corporation, which was formed to hold securities for its own account; 40 South Main Street Realty Trust, which was
	formed to hold our main office, and 800 CJC Realty Corporation, which was formed to invest in and develop residential and commercial
	property. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


	 


	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:


	 


	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash
	and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items, due from banks and interest-bearing demand deposits with other banks.


	 


	The Bank is required to maintain average
	balances on hand or with the Federal Reserve Bank. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, these reserve balances amounted to $836,000 and
	$820,000, respectively.


	 


	SECURITIES:


	 


	Investments in debt securities are adjusted
	for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts so as to approximate the interest method. Gains or losses on sales of investment
	securities are computed on a specific identification basis.


	 






	 


	F-

	8



	 







	 




	 




	The Company classifies debt and equity
	securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. These security classifications may be
	modified after acquisition only under certain specified conditions. In general, securities may be classified as held-to-maturity
	only if the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Trading securities are defined as those bought
	and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. All other securities must be classified as available-for-sale.


	 






	—


	Held-to-maturity securities are measured at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets.
	Unrealized holding gains and losses are not included in earnings or in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. They
	are merely disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.




	 






	—


	Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized
	holding gains and losses are not included in earnings, but are reported as a net amount (less expected tax) in a separate component
	of stockholders’ equity until realized.




	 






	—


	Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized holding
	gains and losses for trading securities are included in earnings.




	 


	For any debt security with a fair value
	less than its amortized cost basis, the Company will determine whether it has the intent to sell the debt security or whether it
	is more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either
	condition is met, the Company will recognize a full impairment charge to earnings. For all other debt securities that are considered
	other-than-temporarily impaired and do not meet either condition, the credit loss portion of impairment will be recognized in earnings
	as realized losses. The other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors will be recorded in other comprehensive income.


	 


	Declines in marketable equity securities
	below their cost that are deemed other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.


	 


	FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK:


	 


	The Company is required to own shares of
	capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLB) in order to borrow from the FHLB. The stock is carried at its cost
	and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the FHLB stock.


	 


	LOANS:


	 


	Loans receivable that management has the
	intent and ability to hold until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balances adjusted for amounts due
	borrowers on unadvanced loans, any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans,
	or unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans.


	 


	Interest on loans is recognized on a simple
	interest basis.


	 


	Loan origination and commitment fees and
	certain direct origination costs are deferred, and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of the related loan's yield. The Company
	is amortizing these amounts over the contractual lives of the related loans.


	 


	Residential real estate loans are generally
	placed on nonaccrual when reaching 90 days past due or in process of foreclosure. All closed-end consumer loans 90 days or more
	past due and any equity line in the process of foreclosure are placed on nonaccrual status. Secured consumer loans are written
	down to realizable value and unsecured consumer loans are charged off upon reaching 120 or 180 days past due depending on the type
	of loan. Commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans and leases which are 90 days or more past due are generally
	placed on nonaccrual status, unless secured by sufficient cash or other assets immediately convertible to cash. When a loan has
	been placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest on loans. A loan can
	be returned to accrual status when collectibility of principal is reasonably assured and the loan has performed for a period of
	time, generally six months.


	 






	 


	F-

	9



	 







	 




	 


	Cash receipts of interest income on impaired
	loans are credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount
	of the loan. Some or all of the cash receipts of interest income on impaired loans are recognized as interest income if the remaining
	net carrying amount of the loan is deemed to be fully collectible. When recognition of interest income on an impaired loan on a
	cash basis is appropriate, the amount of income that is recognized is limited to that which would have been accrued on the net
	carrying amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate. Any cash interest payments received in excess of the limit and not
	applied to reduce the net carrying amount of the loan are recorded as recoveries of charge-offs until the charge-offs are fully
	recovered.


	 


	ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES:


	 


	The allowance for loan losses is established
	as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against
	the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are
	credited to the allowance.


	 


	The allowance for loan losses is evaluated
	on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light
	of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s
	ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently
	subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.


	 



	General Component:



	 


	The general component of the allowance
	for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the following loan segments:
	residential real estate, commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, home equity loans and lines of credit, construction,
	commercial and industrial, and consumer. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate
	to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors:
	levels/trends in delinquencies and underlying collateral values; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in risk
	selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience/ability/depth
	of lending management and staff; and national and local economic trends and conditions. There were no changes in the Company’s
	policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during the years ended December 31,
	2016 and 2015.


	 


	The qualitative factors are determined
	based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as
	follows:


	 


	Residential real estate: The Company generally
	does not originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 percent and does not grant subprime loans. Loans in this segment
	are primarily collateralized by owner-occupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the
	individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on
	the credit quality in this segment.


	 


	Commercial and multi-family real estate:
	Loans in this segment are primarily income-producing properties throughout Eastern Massachusetts, specifically the South Shore.
	The underlying cash flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased
	vacancy rates, which in turn, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management periodically obtains rent rolls
	and continually monitors the cash flows of these loans.


	 


	Construction loans: Loans in this segment
	include land, speculative residential properties, investment, multifamily, rehab to permanent investment properties and owner occupied
	residential properties. Payment is derived from sale of the property or long term rental cash flows once converted to permanent
	financing. Credit risk is affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, vacancies and market conditions.


	 


	Commercial and industrial loans: Loans
	in this segment are made to businesses, are generally secured by assets of the business and are primarily guaranteed by the United
	States Government. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer
	spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.


	 






	 


	F-

	10



	 







	 




	 


	Consumer loans: Loans in this segment are
	primarily secured by automobiles and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.


	 



	Allocated Component:



	 


	The allocated component relates to loans
	that are classified as impaired. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and industrial, commercial and multi-family
	real estate and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
	interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance is established when the discounted
	cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan. Large groups of smaller balance
	homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer,
	home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are subject
	to a troubled debt restructuring agreement.


	 


	A loan is considered impaired when, based
	on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal
	or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining
	impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments
	when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management
	determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of
	the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s
	prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.


	 


	The Company periodically may agree to modify
	the contractual terms of loans on a temporary or permanent basis. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower
	experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). All TDRs are
	initially classified as impaired.


	 



	Unallocated Component:



	 


	An unallocated component is maintained
	to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance
	reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and
	general reserves in the portfolio.


	 


	PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENT IN
	REAL ESTATE:


	 


	Land is stated at cost. Premises, investment
	in real estate and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Cost and related allowances for
	depreciation and amortization of premises, investment in real estate and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are removed
	from the respective accounts with any gain or loss included in income or expense. Depreciation and amortization are calculated
	principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are dependent upon the nature
	and condition of the asset and range from three years to 40 years.


	 


	Premises and equipment and investment in
	real estate are periodically evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
	may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of premises and equipment and investment
	in real estate are less than their carrying amounts. In that event, the Company records a loss of the difference between the carrying
	amount and the fair value of the asset based on quoted market prices, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis.


	 


	OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED AND IN-SUBSTANCE
	FORECLOSURES:


	 


	Other real estate owned includes properties
	acquired through foreclosure and properties classified as in-substance foreclosures in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
	(ASC) 310-40, “Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors." These properties are initially recorded at
	their estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure or transfer, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent
	to foreclosure or transfer, valuations are periodically performed by management and assets are carried at the lower of carrying
	amount or fair value less cost to sell. Any write-down from cost to estimated fair value required at the time of foreclosure or
	classification as an in-substance foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Expenses incurred in connection with
	maintaining these assets, subsequent write-downs and gains or losses recognized upon sale are included in other expense.

	The Company classifies commercial loans
	as in-substance repossessed or foreclosed if the Company receives physical possession of the debtor’s assets regardless of
	whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place. An in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and the Company is considered
	to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan upon either:
	(1) obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure; or (2) the borrower conveying
	all interest in the residential real estate property to the Company to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of
	foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.


	 


	BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE:


	 


	The Company has purchased insurance policies
	on the lives of certain directors, executive officers and employees. Bank-owned life insurance policies are reflected on the consolidated
	balance sheets at cash surrender value. Changes in net cash surrender value of the policies, as well as insurance proceeds received,
	are reflected in non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income and are not subject to income taxes.


	 


	ADVERTISING:


	 


	The Company directly expenses costs associated
	with advertising as they are incurred.


	 


	EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN:


	 


	Compensation expense for the Employee Stock
	Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) is recorded at an amount equal to the shares allocated by the ESOP multiplied by the average
	fair value of the shares during the period. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the year based upon the Company’s
	estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the ESOP. Unearned compensation applicable to the ESOP is reflected
	as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet. The difference between the average fair value and
	the cost of shares allocated by the ESOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital.


	 


	STOCK BASED COMPENSATION:


	 


	The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
	on the grant-date fair value of the award adjusted for expected forfeitures. The Company values share-based stock option awards
	granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense for its awards on a straight-line
	basis over the requisite service period for the entire award (straight-line attribution method), ensuring that the amount of compensation
	cost recognized at any date at least equals the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that time.


	 


	INCOME TAXES:


	 


	The Company recognizes income taxes under
	the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences
	between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect
	when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled.


	 


	It is the Company’s policy to provide
	for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit
	is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no material
	uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income tax matters. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute
	of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2013 through December
	31, 2016. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded as income tax expense.

	FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:


	 


	ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,”
	requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value methods and assumptions used
	by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures are as follows:


	 


	Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying
	amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair values.


	 


	Interest-bearing time deposits with other
	banks: The fair value of interest-bearing time deposits with other banks was determined by discounting the cash flows associated
	with these instruments using current market rates for deposits with similar characteristics.


	 


	Securities: Fair values for securities
	are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted
	market prices of comparable instruments.


	 


	Loans receivable: For variable-rate loans
	that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values
	for other loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with
	similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.


	 


	Accrued interest receivable: The carrying
	amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value.


	 


	Deposit liabilities: The fair values disclosed
	for demand deposits, regular savings, NOW accounts, and money market accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand at the
	reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow
	calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities
	on time deposits.


	 


	Federal Home Loan Bank advances: Fair values
	for Federal Home Loan Bank advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that applies interest rates currently
	being offered on advances to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on Federal Home Loan Bank advances.


	 


	Off-balance sheet instruments: The fair
	value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter similar agreements, taking into
	account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments
	and the unadvanced portion of loans, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the
	committed rates.


	 


	EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS):


	 


	The Company has adopted the EPS guidance
	included in ASC 260-10. As presented below, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders
	by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would
	occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance
	of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. For purposes of computing diluted EPS, the treasury stock method
	is used.


	 


	Unallocated ESOP shares and unearned shares
	of restricted stock are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations.

	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:


	 


	As an “emerging growth company,”
	as defined in Title 1 of Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period
	to delay adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made
	applicable to private companies. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements
	of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As of December 31, 2016, there is no significant
	difference in the comparability of the consolidated financial statements as a result of this extended transition period.


	 


	In May 2014 and August 2015, the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic 606).” The objective of this ASU is to clarify principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue
	standard for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards. The guidance in ASU
	2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts
	for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The core principal of the
	guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
	that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the extended
	transition period for an emerging growth company, the amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within that period. Earlier application is permitted only
	as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
	The adoption of ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value
	Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).”
	The objective of this update is to address the diversity in practice related to how certain investments measured at net asset value
	with redemption dates in the future are categorized within the fair value hierarchy. The amendments in this update remove the requirement
	to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share
	practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible
	to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to
	investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. Under the extended transition
	period for an emerging growth company, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
	those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to
	have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
	“Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”
	The amendments in this ASU address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments
	and makes targeted improvements to GAAP as follows:


	 






	1.


	Require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or
	those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
	However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment,
	if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment
	of the same manner.








	2.


	Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without determinable fair values by requiring
	a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required
	to measure the investment at fair value.








	3.


	Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant
	assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost
	on the balance sheet.








	4.


	Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of
	financial instruments for disclosure purposes.








	5.


	Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total
	change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected
	to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.








	6.


	Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category
	and form of financial assets (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the
	financial statements.








	7.


	Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset
	related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred tax assets.




	 


	Under the extended transition period for
	an emerging growth company, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and
	interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application of item 5 above is permitted for fiscal
	years, or interim periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Early application of all other amendments in
	this ASU is not permitted. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated
	financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
	“Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring
	reporting entities to recognize all leases, including operating, as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
	disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company, the amendments
	in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2020. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated
	financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
	“Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting.” The ASU simplifies
	several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification
	of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the extended transition
	period for an emerging growth company, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
	2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently reviewing this ASU
	to determine if it will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.

	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
	“Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The
	ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical
	experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now
	use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today
	will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses.
	Organizations will continue to use judgement to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances.
	Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets
	with credit deterioration. Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company, this update will be effective for
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
	in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the amendments of
	ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
	“Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” Current GAAP is unclear or does not include specific guidance
	on how to classify certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in
	how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Under the extended transition period for an emerging
	growth company, the amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods
	within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted
	in the same period. Entities will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively. If it is impracticable to apply the guidance
	retrospectively for an issue, the amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively. As this guidance only affects
	the classification within the statement of cash flows, ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
	consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 “Statement
	of Cash Flows – Restricted Cash (Topic 230).” The amendments in this update require that a statement of cash flows
	explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash
	or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should
	be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the
	statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update do not provide a definition of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
	Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is
	permitted, including adoption in an interim period. As this guidance only affects the classification within the statement of cash
	flows, ASU 2016-18 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

	During 2016, proceeds from sales of available-for-sale
	securities amounted to $1.2 million. Gross realized gains on those sales amounted to $27,000, and there were no gross realized
	losses. During 2015, proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities amounted to $428,000. Gross realized gains on those sales
	amounted to $10,000 and there were no gross realized losses. The tax expense applicable to these net realized gains for the years
	ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $10,000 and $4,000, respectively.

	As of December 31, 2016, investment securities
	with unrealized losses consist of 17 debt securities issued by U.S. government corporations and government-sponsored agencies,
	12 debt securities issued by states of the United States and political subdivisions of the states and mortgage-backed securities
	consisting of 28 government agencies and government sponsored enterprises and 1 private label. The Company reviews investments
	for other-than-temporary impairment using a number of factors including the length of time and the extent to which the market value
	has been less than cost and by examining any credit deterioration or ratings downgrades. The unrealized losses in the above tables
	are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As Company management has the intent and ability to hold impaired
	debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future if classified as available-for-sale, no declines are deemed to be
	other-than-temporary.

	For those debt securities for which the
	fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost and the Company does not intend to sell such security and it is more
	likely than not that it will not be required to sell such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis less any credit
	losses, ASC 320-10, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,” requires that the credit component of the other-than-temporary
	impairment losses be recognized in earnings while the noncredit component is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of related
	taxes.


	 


	Upon acquisition of a security, the Company
	decides whether it is within the scope of the accounting guidance for beneficial interests in securitized financial assets or will
	be evaluated for impairment under the accounting guidance for investments in debt and equity securities.


	 


	The accounting guidance for beneficial
	interests in securitized financial assets provides incremental impairment guidance for a subset of debt securities within the scope
	of the guidance for investments in debt and equity securities. For securities where the security is a beneficial interest in securitized
	financial assets, the Company uses the beneficial interests in securitized financial assets impairment model. For securities where
	the security is not a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets, the Company uses the debt and equity securities impairment
	model.


	 


	No other-than-temporary impairment losses
	were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, debt securities with other-than-temporary
	impairment losses related to credit quality that were recognized in earnings consisted of one non-agency mortgage-backed security.
	The Company estimated the credit component portion of loss for the non-agency mortgage-backed securities using a discounted cash
	flow model. Significant inputs for the non-agency mortgage-backed securities included estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral
	based on key assumptions such as default rate, loss severity and prepayment rate. The present value of the expected cash flows
	were compared to the Company’s holdings to determine the credit-related impairment loss. Based on the expected cash flows
	derived from the model, the Company expects to recover the remaining unrealized losses on non-agency mortgage-backed securities.

	Credit Quality Information



	 


	The Company utilizes a seven grade internal
	loan rating system for commercial and multi-family real estate, construction and commercial loans as follows:


	 


	Loans rated 1 - 3: Loans in these categories
	are considered “pass” rated loans with low to average risk.


	 


	Loans rated 4: Loans in this category are
	considered “special mention.” These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored
	by management.


	 


	Loans rated 5: Loans in this category are
	considered “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current
	net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that the Company will
	sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.


	 


	Loans rated 6: Loans in this category are
	considered “doubtful.” Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard
	with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts,
	highly questionable and improbable.


	 


	Loans rated 7: Loans in this category are
	considered uncollectible (“loss”) and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted.


	 


	On an annual basis, or more often if needed,
	the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial and multi-family real estate, construction and commercial loans. For
	residential real estate, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans, the Company initially assesses credit quality
	based upon the borrower’s ability to pay and subsequently monitors these loans based on the borrower’s payment activity.


	 



	The Company classifies
	loans modified as TDRs as impaired loans with an allowance established as part of the allocated component of the allowance for
	loan losses when the discounted cash flows or value of the underlying collateral of the impaired loan is lower than its carrying
	value.




	 




	During the year ended
	December 31, 2016, there were five loans modified as TDRs. Three of the modified loans, with a total post-modification recorded
	investment of $1.6 million, paid off by December 31, 2016. The following tables set forth information regarding loans modified
	as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company
	had no operating loss and tax credit carryovers for tax purposes. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had capital loss carryovers
	of $110,000 which are due to expire in 2019. The capital losses can only be utilized against realized capital gains; therefore,
	as of December 31, 2016 a valuation allowance in the amount of $37,000 exists against the deferred tax benefit to the extent management
	deems it probable the deferred tax benefits will not be fully realized.


	 


	In connection with its initial public offering,
	the Company donated common stock and cash in the amount of $725,000 to the Foundation. The remaining charitable contribution carryforward
	was $446,000 at December 31, 2016 and expires in 2019. The related tax benefit included in net deferred tax assets is $178,000.
	A valuation allowance in the amount of $83,000 was released in 2016 based on management’s assessment that the Company will
	be able to fully utilize the deferred tax asset related to the charitable contribution before it expires.


	 


	In prior years, the Bank was allowed a
	special tax-basis bad debt deduction under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, retained earnings of the
	Bank as of December 31, 2016 includes approximately $1,094,000 for which federal and state income taxes have not been provided.
	If the Bank no longer qualifies as a bank as defined in certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, this amount will be subject
	to recapture in taxable income using a combined federal and state tax rate of approximately 40%.


	 



	NOTE 10 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS





	 






	401(k) Plan




	The Company provides a savings and retirement
	plan for employees through the Co-operative Banks’ Employees Retirement Association (CBERA) 401(k) Plan, which is a multiple
	employer tax-qualified profit sharing plan with a salary deferral feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“401(k)
	Plan”). All employees who have attained age 21 and have completed three months of employment during which they worked at
	least 250 hours are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan.


	 


	The plan provides for voluntary contributions
	by participating employees ranging from 1% to 75% of their compensation, subject to the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue
	Code. In addition to salary deferral contributions, the Company will make a matching contribution to each participant’s account
	equal to 100% of the participant’s contribution, up to 5% of the participant’s pre-tax and after-tax contributions.
	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, contribution expense attributable to the plan amounted to $88,000 and $82,000,
	respectively.

	Incentive Plan




	The Company has a discretionary Incentive
	Plan whereby all employees are eligible to receive a payment if the Company meets or exceeds certain base performance standards
	for its fiscal year. The structure of the Incentive Plan is to be reviewed on an annual basis by the Board of Directors.


	 




	Executive Annual Incentive Plan




	The Company adopted an executive incentive
	plan effective January 1, 2015, which superseded and replaced the discretionary bonus arrangement above for certain named executive
	officers. For each plan year (which is the calendar year), each participant will receive an award agreement, which will provide
	the annual bonus award amount, designated as a percentage of base salary, and the performance objectives that must be satisfied
	for the participant to receive the annual bonus award. The specific performance objectives will be determined annually by the Company,
	but generally include objective performance targets on financial performance, growth, asset quality and risk management and subjective
	performance objectives, such as particular qualitative factors for the participant, based on his or her duties to the Company.
	Each performance objective will specify level of achievements at “threshold,” “target” and “maximum”
	levels and will be weighted by priority as a percentage of the total annual bonus award payable to the participant.


	 


	Incentive compensation expense for the
	Incentive and the Executive Annual Incentive Plans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $126,000 and $132,000,
	respectively.




	 






	Executive Supplemental Retirement
	Plan




	The Company adopted a supplemental executive
	retirement plan (“SERP”) effective January 1, 2014. The SERP is a non-qualified retirement plan that provides supplemental
	retirement benefits to participants who are key employees as designated by the Compensation Committee. The President and Chief
	Executive Officer is currently the only participant in the SERP. Total expense for the plan for the years ended December 31, 2016
	and 2015 amounted to $48,000 and $46,000, respectively.




	 






	Equity Incentive Plan




	On November 24, 2015, stockholders of the
	Company approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 EIP”). The 2015 EIP provides for the award of up to 314,661
	shares of common stock pursuant to grants of restricted stock awards and stock options. Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 EIP,
	on June 1, 2016, the Board of Directors granted 70,950 shares of restricted stock and 169,500 stock options to employees and directors.
	Of the 70,950 shares of restricted stock granted, 47,600 shares vest evenly over a five year period and 23,350 shares vest over
	a four year period. Of the 169,500 stock options granted, 122,500 options vest evenly over a five year period and 47,000 options
	vest over a four year period. The maximum term of each option is ten years. At December 31, 2016, there were 18,953 restricted
	stock awards and 55,258 stock options available for future grants.


	 


	The fair value of each option awarded for
	the 2015 EIP is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model. The expected life represents the
	period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding, taking into account the contractual term and the vesting period.
	The expected volatility is based on peer group volatility because the Company does not have sufficient trading history. The dividend
	yield is based on the Company’s expectation of no dividend payouts. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield
	curve in effect at the date of the grant for a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.

	and the recognized tax benefit related to this expense was $42,000.


	 




	Employee Stock Ownership Plan




	The Company adopted a tax-qualified employee
	stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) for the benefit of eligible employees. On October 10, 2014, in accordance with a Plan
	of Conversion (the “Conversion”), Conahasset Bancshares, MHC, the Bank’s former mutual holding company, completed
	a mutual-to-stock conversion pursuant to which the Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc., (the “Company”)
	a stock holding company incorporated in February 2014. The Company completed its initial public offering in connection with the
	conversion transaction by selling a total of 2,182,125 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share in a subscription
	offering, of which 179,807 shares were purchased by the Bank's ESOP.


	 


	The ESOP funded its stock purchase through
	a loan from the Company equal to 100% of the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The ESOP trustee will repay the loan
	principally through the Bank's contributions to the ESOP and, possibly, dividends paid on common stock held by the plan over the
	remaining loan term of 28.2 years.


	 


	The trustee will hold the shares purchased
	by the ESOP in an unallocated suspense account. Shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loan
	is repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among the participants’ accounts on the basis of each participant’s
	proportional share of compensation relative to all participants. Participants will vest in their benefit at a rate of 20% per year,
	beginning after the completion of their second year of service, such that the participants will be 100% vested upon completion
	of six years of credited service. Participants who were employed by the Bank immediately prior to the conversion will receive credit
	for vesting purposes for years of service prior to adoption of the ESOP. Participants also will become fully vested upon normal
	retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the employee stock ownership plan. Generally, participants
	will receive distributions from the ESOP upon severance from employment. The ESOP reallocates any unvested shares forfeited upon
	termination of employment among the remaining participants.


	 


	Under applicable accounting requirements,
	the Company will record a compensation expense for the ESOP equal to the fair market value of the shares when they are committed
	to be released from the suspense account to participants' accounts under the plan.


	 


	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the remaining
	principal balance on the ESOP debt was $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

	Employment Agreements




	The Bank has entered into an employment
	agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer, with an initial term of three years. The agreement provides for a specified
	minimum annual compensation and the continuation of benefits currently received upon termination events, including a change in
	control, as defined in the agreement. The Bank has also entered into change in control agreements with two officers of the Bank
	with an initial term of two years, which provide for a lump sum severance payment, subject to limitations. These agreements must
	be approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis after the initial term, with an extension for an additional year. If the
	Board of Directors determines not to extend the term, a notice of non-renewal must be issued.


	 



	NOTE 11 - OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES



	 


	The Company is a party to financial instruments
	with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments
	include commitments to extend credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk
	in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect
	the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.


	 






	 


	F-

	33



	 







	 




	 


	The Company’s exposure to credit
	loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented
	by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional
	obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.


	 


	Commitments to extend credit are agreements
	to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have
	fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s
	creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension
	of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies but usually includes income-producing
	commercial properties or residential real estate.


	 


	Financial instrument liabilities whose
	contract amounts represent off-balance sheet credit risk are as follows:

	The Company accrues credit losses related
	to off-balance sheet financial instruments. Potential losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments are estimated using the same
	risk factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses is recorded within
	other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $11,000 and $9,000, respectively.


	 



	NOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT
	LIABILITIES



	 


	In April 2012, the Company amended its
	agreement originally dated March 10, 2007 with a third party in which the third party is to provide the Company with data processing
	and other related services. The effective date of the amendment was May 1, 2012 for a seven-year term and will automatically renew
	for successive seven-year terms unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew. Each month, the Company shall
	pay certain minimum monthly charges, as defined in the agreement, as well as charges for any additional services provided.


	 



	NOTE 13 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS



	 


	ASC 820-10, “Fair Value Measurement
	- Overall,” provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance also
	allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets
	and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis.


	 


	In accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company
	groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the
	assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.


	 






	 


	F-

	34



	 







	 




	 


	Level 1 - Valuations for assets and liabilities
	traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 also includes U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government
	and agency mortgage-backed securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active markets. Valuations are obtained from readily
	available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.


	 


	Level 2 - Valuations for assets and liabilities
	traded in less active dealer or broker markets. Valuations are obtained from third party pricing services for identical or comparable
	assets or liabilities.


	 


	Level 3 - Valuations for assets and liabilities
	that are derived from other methodologies, including option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques,
	are not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and
	projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets and liabilities.


	 


	A financial instrument’s level within
	the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


	 


	A description of the valuation methodologies
	used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
	hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were applied to all of the Company’s financial assets and financial
	liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company did not have any significant transfers between
	level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company’s investment in mortgage-backed
	securities and other debt securities available-for-sale is generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For
	these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from independent pricing services. The fair value measurements consider observable
	data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus
	prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument’s terms and conditions.


	 


	Level 3 is for positions that are not traded
	in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability,
	and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best
	estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence
	such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable
	entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalization and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the
	equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows.


	 


	The Company’s impaired loans are
	reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Collateral values
	are estimated using level 2 inputs based upon appraisals of similar properties obtained from a third party. For level 3 inputs,
	fair value is based upon management estimates of the value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected cash
	flows.

	The carrying amounts of financial instruments
	shown in the above table are included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 under the indicated captions.
	Accounting policies related to financial instruments are described in Note 2.


	 



	NOTE 14 - SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS
	OF CREDIT RISK



	 


	Most of the Bank’s business activity
	is with customers located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. There are no concentrations of credit to borrowers that have
	similar economic characteristics. The majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real
	estate located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.


	 



	NOTE 15 - REGULATORY MATTERS



	 


	The Bank is subject to various regulatory
	capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain
	mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect
	on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
	action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities
	and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification
	are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

	Effective January 1, 2015 (with a phase-in
	period of two to four years for certain components), the Bank became subject to capital regulations adopted by the Board of Governors
	of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and the FDIC, which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the
	changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulations require a common equity Tier 1 (“CET 1”) capital ratio of 4.5%,
	a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and
	a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable adjustments
	and deductions. Under prompt corrective action regulations, in order to be considered “well capitalized,” the Bank
	must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0%
	and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the regulations establish a capital conservation buffer above the required capital
	ratios that phases in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is
	fully phased in at 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2016, failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer
	will limit the ability of the Bank and the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. At December
	31, 2016, the Bank exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer.


	 


	Management believes, as of December 31,
	2016, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the most recent
	notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.
	To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1, total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based
	and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that
	management believes have changed the Bank’s category.


	 


	The Bank’s actual capital amounts
	and ratios are also presented in the table as of December 31.
