Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate,[1] January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey)[1][2][3] is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for "Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.[4][5][6][7]

Early years[edit]
Tate was born in Stuttgart,[1] which was then part of West Germany, to German American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans.[8] Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington.
Career[edit]
Queensrÿche (1982–2012)[edit]
While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensrÿche) at a local rock festival.[9] After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs.[1][9] Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensrÿche in 2012.[10]
The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future.[1] The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song "The Lady Wore Black", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensrÿche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.[11] Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.
Queensrÿche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983,[9] with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.[11] EMI re-released the EP, Queensrÿche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensrÿche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensrÿche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre.[12] Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005–2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensrÿche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name.[13] It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensrÿche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.[14]
Queensrÿche Featuring Geoff Tate (2012–2014)[edit]
Following his firing and while awaiting the outcome of a settlement or court ruling deciding who would ultimately gain access to the name Queensrÿche, Tate announced his own lineup using the name "Queensrÿche" on September 1, 2012 via his official Facebook page.[15]
Until Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche in April 2014 to the other band members, they were promoted by their booking agent under the name "Queensrÿche Starring Geoff Tate the Original Voice".[16] The lineup would originally feature Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer, Glen Drover,[17] and two of his former band mates from the band Myth; Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.[10][18] Drover left the band on November 23, 2012.[17] On January 25, 2013, his replacement was announced to be guitarist Robert Sarzo, while Blotzer was also replaced on drums by Simon Wright, who has remained since.[19]
The band embarked on an "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" on April 6, 2013, celebrating the album's 25th anniversary.[20] predominantly touring the American Southwest.[19] The tour continued through to September 2014 with several breaks, among others with Tate touring with his solo band in May 2014.[21]
As part of the settlement agreement, Tate was granted the exclusive rights to perform Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety as a unique performance, but not under the name Queensrÿche.[14]
Tate, however, presumably does not perceive his current project to be a similar band setting as the one he used to have with Queensrÿche before the 2012 split, saying: "I don't ever want to be in a band again. A 'band'-band that sticks together through thick and thin and all that, you know. I've already done that. I want to work with different groups of people. And I want to constantly be changing it up to make it interesting and different. And I want to play with as many great players as I possibly can."[22]









"Cold" (2013)

With this lineup, Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23 via through Deadline Music, a sub-label of Cleopatra Records.[23][24] It was co-written, produced and mixed in 6 weeks by Jason Slater[25] and mastered by Maor Appelbaum,[26] but Billy Sherwood was later hired to remix the album, "[as it] seems there are sonic issues with the previous versions".[27][28] Several days later, however, Sherwood pulled out of the project, citing scheduling issues.[29] The work was subsequently spread out over at least four remixers, because of the deadline that had to be met.[30] "Cold", the first single off Frequency Unknown was released on April 3, 2013.[31]
Operation: Mindcrime (2014-present)[edit]
Following his farewell tour as Queensryche, Tate renamed his band to Operation: Mindcrime after the Queensryche album of the same name. In 2015, John Moyer, Brian Tichy, and Scott Moughton became full-time members following the departures of Rudy Sarzo and Robert Sarzo. Their debut album, named The Key, which is part one of a three part trilogy, was released on September 18, 2015.[5]

Solo work[edit]
In 1985, Tate participated in the famine relief collaboration Hear 'n Aid.
In 2002, Tate released an eponymous solo album on Sanctuary Records. Around this time, he had shaven his long hair, in solidarity with a close family member who was battling cancer until her death.[32]
On November 6, 2012, Tate released his second solo record on InsideOut Music, entitled Kings and Thieves.
Other activities[edit]
Tate stars as the narrator and killer in the found footage horror movie The Burningmoore Incident. It was released direct-to-video on March 4, 2013.[33] Tate is scheduled to score the music to the in-production crime movie Fallen Moon.[34]
Tate is a wine enthusiast. He started making wine at age 14,[35] explaining: "I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn’t very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion."[36] The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensrÿche: "I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I’d make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing."[35] Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, "Insania".[37]
Controversy[edit]
Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy and criticism, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding and following the split with Queensrÿche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre[38]) and his control over the band during the 1997–2012 period, according to court declarations from his former bandmates.[39]
Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012.[40] Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd "You guys suck," which his bandmates, as well as fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration "I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them."[41] He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: "It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn’t respect the fans' type of thing."[36] He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: "I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate."[42]
Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche has also generated controversy due to the artwork of their album, Frequency Unknown. The abbreviation "F.U." is emphasized on the front cover, and is often used in English as a synonym for the profane expression "Fuck you". Tate, however, when asked about the meaning behind the artwork in an interview, responded with "Oh gosh, people read so much into everything. It's kind of funny, isn't it?"[43]
Also, during the "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" tour, on May 17, 2013, Tate created controversy during a show in St. Charles, Illinois. Ten minutes into the show, he grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.[44] Tate has not shown remorse, instead explaining that: "some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy]."[45] He has also accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.[42] In another instance, Tate spat on a fan from stage.[46]
Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the lawsuits, saying: "I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?"[42] He also added: "Because we’re in litigation there is a concerted effort to create a personality for me, to try and create a smear campaign really." and expressed belief that most negative comments about him on the internet are posted by the same, small group of people who use fake accounts to make it appear as though his detractors are much greater in number.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to "Jet City Woman."[47] In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans.[37] Tate has four daughters: Sabra, Miranda, Bella, and Emily. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger.
Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and as band manager from 2005-2012.[48] She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensrÿche's fanclub.[49] Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008,[50] while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensrÿche,[50][51] and on 18 July married Miranda,[52] but they divorced about half a year later.[53] Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensrÿche Cabaret.[54] Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song "Home Again" on the 2009 Queensrÿche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of "Silent Lucidity" for the album Frequency Unknown.[55]
Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing.[1]

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate,[1] January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey)[1][2][3] is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for "Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.[4][5][6][7]

Early years[edit]
Tate was born in Stuttgart,[1] which was then part of West Germany, to German American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans.[8] Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington.
Career[edit]
Queensrÿche (1982–2012)[edit]
While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensrÿche) at a local rock festival.[9] After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs.[1][9] Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensrÿche in 2012.[10]
The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future.[1] The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song "The Lady Wore Black", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensrÿche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.[11] Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.
Queensrÿche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983,[9] with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.[11] EMI re-released the EP, Queensrÿche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensrÿche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensrÿche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre.[12] Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005–2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensrÿche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name.[13] It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensrÿche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.[14]
Queensrÿche Featuring Geoff Tate (2012–2014)[edit]
Following his firing and while awaiting the outcome of a settlement or court ruling deciding who would ultimately gain access to the name Queensrÿche, Tate announced his own lineup using the name "Queensrÿche" on September 1, 2012 via his official Facebook page.[15]
Until Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche in April 2014 to the other band members, they were promoted by their booking agent under the name "Queensrÿche Starring Geoff Tate the Original Voice".[16] The lineup would originally feature Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer, Glen Drover,[17] and two of his former band mates from the band Myth; Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.[10][18] Drover left the band on November 23, 2012.[17] On January 25, 2013, his replacement was announced to be guitarist Robert Sarzo, while Blotzer was also replaced on drums by Simon Wright, who has remained since.[19]
The band embarked on an "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" on April 6, 2013, celebrating the album's 25th anniversary.[20] predominantly touring the American Southwest.[19] The tour continued through to September 2014 with several breaks, among others with Tate touring with his solo band in May 2014.[21]
As part of the settlement agreement, Tate was granted the exclusive rights to perform Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety as a unique performance, but not under the name Queensrÿche.[14]
Tate, however, presumably does not perceive his current project to be a similar band setting as the one he used to have with Queensrÿche before the 2012 split, saying: "I don't ever want to be in a band again. A 'band'-band that sticks together through thick and thin and all that, you know. I've already done that. I want to work with different groups of people. And I want to constantly be changing it up to make it interesting and different. And I want to play with as many great players as I possibly can."[22]









"Cold" (2013)

With this lineup, Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23 via through Deadline Music, a sub-label of Cleopatra Records.[23][24] It was co-written, produced and mixed in 6 weeks by Jason Slater[25] and mastered by Maor Appelbaum,[26] but Billy Sherwood was later hired to remix the album, "[as it] seems there are sonic issues with the previous versions".[27][28] Several days later, however, Sherwood pulled out of the project, citing scheduling issues.[29] The work was subsequently spread out over at least four remixers, because of the deadline that had to be met.[30] "Cold", the first single off Frequency Unknown was released on April 3, 2013.[31]
Operation: Mindcrime (2014-present)[edit]
Following his farewell tour as Queensryche, Tate renamed his band to Operation: Mindcrime after the Queensryche album of the same name. In 2015, John Moyer, Brian Tichy, and Scott Moughton became full-time members following the departures of Rudy Sarzo and Robert Sarzo. Their debut album, named The Key, which is part one of a three part trilogy, was released on September 18, 2015.[5]

Solo work[edit]
In 1985, Tate participated in the famine relief collaboration Hear 'n Aid.
In 2002, Tate released an eponymous solo album on Sanctuary Records. Around this time, he had shaven his long hair, in solidarity with a close family member who was battling cancer until her death.[32]
On November 6, 2012, Tate released his second solo record on InsideOut Music, entitled Kings and Thieves.
Other activities[edit]
Tate stars as the narrator and killer in the found footage horror movie The Burningmoore Incident. It was released direct-to-video on March 4, 2013.[33] Tate is scheduled to score the music to the in-production crime movie Fallen Moon.[34]
Tate is a wine enthusiast. He started making wine at age 14,[35] explaining: "I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn’t very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion."[36] The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensrÿche: "I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I’d make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing."[35] Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, "Insania".[37]
Controversy[edit]
Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy and criticism, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding and following the split with Queensrÿche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre[38]) and his control over the band during the 1997–2012 period, according to court declarations from his former bandmates.[39]
Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012.[40] Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd "You guys suck," which his bandmates, as well as fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration "I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them."[41] He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: "It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn’t respect the fans' type of thing."[36] He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: "I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate."[42]
Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche has also generated controversy due to the artwork of their album, Frequency Unknown. The abbreviation "F.U." is emphasized on the front cover, and is often used in English as a synonym for the profane expression "Fuck you". Tate, however, when asked about the meaning behind the artwork in an interview, responded with "Oh gosh, people read so much into everything. It's kind of funny, isn't it?"[43]
Also, during the "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" tour, on May 17, 2013, Tate created controversy during a show in St. Charles, Illinois. Ten minutes into the show, he grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.[44] Tate has not shown remorse, instead explaining that: "some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy]."[45] He has also accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.[42] In another instance, Tate spat on a fan from stage.[46]
Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the lawsuits, saying: "I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?"[42] He also added: "Because we’re in litigation there is a concerted effort to create a personality for me, to try and create a smear campaign really." and expressed belief that most negative comments about him on the internet are posted by the same, small group of people who use fake accounts to make it appear as though his detractors are much greater in number.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to "Jet City Woman."[47] In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans.[37] Tate has four daughters: Sabra, Miranda, Bella, and Emily. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger.
Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and as band manager from 2005-2012.[48] She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensrÿche's fanclub.[49] Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008,[50] while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensrÿche,[50][51] and on 18 July married Miranda,[52] but they divorced about half a year later.[53] Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensrÿche Cabaret.[54] Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song "Home Again" on the 2009 Queensrÿche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of "Silent Lucidity" for the album Frequency Unknown.[55]
Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing.[1]

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate,[1] January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey)[1][2][3] is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for "Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.[4][5][6][7]

Early years[edit]
Tate was born in Stuttgart,[1] which was then part of West Germany, to German American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans.[8] Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington.
Career[edit]
Queensrÿche (1982–2012)[edit]
While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensrÿche) at a local rock festival.[9] After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs.[1][9] Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensrÿche in 2012.[10]
The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future.[1] The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song "The Lady Wore Black", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensrÿche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.[11] Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.
Queensrÿche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983,[9] with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.[11] EMI re-released the EP, Queensrÿche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensrÿche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensrÿche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre.[12] Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005–2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensrÿche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name.[13] It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensrÿche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.[14]
Queensrÿche Featuring Geoff Tate (2012–2014)[edit]
Following his firing and while awaiting the outcome of a settlement or court ruling deciding who would ultimately gain access to the name Queensrÿche, Tate announced his own lineup using the name "Queensrÿche" on September 1, 2012 via his official Facebook page.[15]
Until Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche in April 2014 to the other band members, they were promoted by their booking agent under the name "Queensrÿche Starring Geoff Tate the Original Voice".[16] The lineup would originally feature Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer, Glen Drover,[17] and two of his former band mates from the band Myth; Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.[10][18] Drover left the band on November 23, 2012.[17] On January 25, 2013, his replacement was announced to be guitarist Robert Sarzo, while Blotzer was also replaced on drums by Simon Wright, who has remained since.[19]
The band embarked on an "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" on April 6, 2013, celebrating the album's 25th anniversary.[20] predominantly touring the American Southwest.[19] The tour continued through to September 2014 with several breaks, among others with Tate touring with his solo band in May 2014.[21]
As part of the settlement agreement, Tate was granted the exclusive rights to perform Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety as a unique performance, but not under the name Queensrÿche.[14]
Tate, however, presumably does not perceive his current project to be a similar band setting as the one he used to have with Queensrÿche before the 2012 split, saying: "I don't ever want to be in a band again. A 'band'-band that sticks together through thick and thin and all that, you know. I've already done that. I want to work with different groups of people. And I want to constantly be changing it up to make it interesting and different. And I want to play with as many great players as I possibly can."[22]









"Cold" (2013)

With this lineup, Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23 via through Deadline Music, a sub-label of Cleopatra Records.[23][24] It was co-written, produced and mixed in 6 weeks by Jason Slater[25] and mastered by Maor Appelbaum,[26] but Billy Sherwood was later hired to remix the album, "[as it] seems there are sonic issues with the previous versions".[27][28] Several days later, however, Sherwood pulled out of the project, citing scheduling issues.[29] The work was subsequently spread out over at least four remixers, because of the deadline that had to be met.[30] "Cold", the first single off Frequency Unknown was released on April 3, 2013.[31]
Operation: Mindcrime (2014-present)[edit]
Following his farewell tour as Queensryche, Tate renamed his band to Operation: Mindcrime after the Queensryche album of the same name. In 2015, John Moyer, Brian Tichy, and Scott Moughton became full-time members following the departures of Rudy Sarzo and Robert Sarzo. Their debut album, named The Key, which is part one of a three part trilogy, was released on September 18, 2015.[5]

Solo work[edit]
In 1985, Tate participated in the famine relief collaboration Hear 'n Aid.
In 2002, Tate released an eponymous solo album on Sanctuary Records. Around this time, he had shaven his long hair, in solidarity with a close family member who was battling cancer until her death.[32]
On November 6, 2012, Tate released his second solo record on InsideOut Music, entitled Kings and Thieves.
Other activities[edit]
Tate stars as the narrator and killer in the found footage horror movie The Burningmoore Incident. It was released direct-to-video on March 4, 2013.[33] Tate is scheduled to score the music to the in-production crime movie Fallen Moon.[34]
Tate is a wine enthusiast. He started making wine at age 14,[35] explaining: "I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn’t very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion."[36] The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensrÿche: "I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I’d make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing."[35] Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, "Insania".[37]
Controversy[edit]
Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy and criticism, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding and following the split with Queensrÿche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre[38]) and his control over the band during the 1997–2012 period, according to court declarations from his former bandmates.[39]
Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012.[40] Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd "You guys suck," which his bandmates, as well as fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration "I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them."[41] He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: "It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn’t respect the fans' type of thing."[36] He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: "I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate."[42]
Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche has also generated controversy due to the artwork of their album, Frequency Unknown. The abbreviation "F.U." is emphasized on the front cover, and is often used in English as a synonym for the profane expression "Fuck you". Tate, however, when asked about the meaning behind the artwork in an interview, responded with "Oh gosh, people read so much into everything. It's kind of funny, isn't it?"[43]
Also, during the "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" tour, on May 17, 2013, Tate created controversy during a show in St. Charles, Illinois. Ten minutes into the show, he grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.[44] Tate has not shown remorse, instead explaining that: "some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy]."[45] He has also accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.[42] In another instance, Tate spat on a fan from stage.[46]
Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the lawsuits, saying: "I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?"[42] He also added: "Because we’re in litigation there is a concerted effort to create a personality for me, to try and create a smear campaign really." and expressed belief that most negative comments about him on the internet are posted by the same, small group of people who use fake accounts to make it appear as though his detractors are much greater in number.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to "Jet City Woman."[47] In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans.[37] Tate has four daughters: Sabra, Miranda, Bella, and Emily. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger.
Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and as band manager from 2005-2012.[48] She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensrÿche's fanclub.[49] Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008,[50] while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensrÿche,[50][51] and on 18 July married Miranda,[52] but they divorced about half a year later.[53] Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensrÿche Cabaret.[54] Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song "Home Again" on the 2009 Queensrÿche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of "Silent Lucidity" for the album Frequency Unknown.[55]
Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing.[1]

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate,[1] January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey)[1][2][3] is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for "Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.[4][5][6][7]

Early years[edit]
Tate was born in Stuttgart,[1] which was then part of West Germany, to German American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans.[8] Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington.
Career[edit]
Queensrÿche (1982–2012)[edit]
While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensrÿche) at a local rock festival.[9] After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs.[1][9] Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensrÿche in 2012.[10]
The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future.[1] The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song "The Lady Wore Black", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensrÿche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.[11] Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.
Queensrÿche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983,[9] with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.[11] EMI re-released the EP, Queensrÿche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensrÿche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensrÿche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre.[12] Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005–2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensrÿche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name.[13] It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensrÿche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.[14]
Queensrÿche Featuring Geoff Tate (2012–2014)[edit]
Following his firing and while awaiting the outcome of a settlement or court ruling deciding who would ultimately gain access to the name Queensrÿche, Tate announced his own lineup using the name "Queensrÿche" on September 1, 2012 via his official Facebook page.[15]
Until Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche in April 2014 to the other band members, they were promoted by their booking agent under the name "Queensrÿche Starring Geoff Tate the Original Voice".[16] The lineup would originally feature Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer, Glen Drover,[17] and two of his former band mates from the band Myth; Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.[10][18] Drover left the band on November 23, 2012.[17] On January 25, 2013, his replacement was announced to be guitarist Robert Sarzo, while Blotzer was also replaced on drums by Simon Wright, who has remained since.[19]
The band embarked on an "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" on April 6, 2013, celebrating the album's 25th anniversary.[20] predominantly touring the American Southwest.[19] The tour continued through to September 2014 with several breaks, among others with Tate touring with his solo band in May 2014.[21]
As part of the settlement agreement, Tate was granted the exclusive rights to perform Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety as a unique performance, but not under the name Queensrÿche.[14]
Tate, however, presumably does not perceive his current project to be a similar band setting as the one he used to have with Queensrÿche before the 2012 split, saying: "I don't ever want to be in a band again. A 'band'-band that sticks together through thick and thin and all that, you know. I've already done that. I want to work with different groups of people. And I want to constantly be changing it up to make it interesting and different. And I want to play with as many great players as I possibly can."[22]









"Cold" (2013)

With this lineup, Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23 via through Deadline Music, a sub-label of Cleopatra Records.[23][24] It was co-written, produced and mixed in 6 weeks by Jason Slater[25] and mastered by Maor Appelbaum,[26] but Billy Sherwood was later hired to remix the album, "[as it] seems there are sonic issues with the previous versions".[27][28] Several days later, however, Sherwood pulled out of the project, citing scheduling issues.[29] The work was subsequently spread out over at least four remixers, because of the deadline that had to be met.[30] "Cold", the first single off Frequency Unknown was released on April 3, 2013.[31]
Operation: Mindcrime (2014-present)[edit]
Following his farewell tour as Queensryche, Tate renamed his band to Operation: Mindcrime after the Queensryche album of the same name. In 2015, John Moyer, Brian Tichy, and Scott Moughton became full-time members following the departures of Rudy Sarzo and Robert Sarzo. Their debut album, named The Key, which is part one of a three part trilogy, was released on September 18, 2015.[5]

Solo work[edit]
In 1985, Tate participated in the famine relief collaboration Hear 'n Aid.
In 2002, Tate released an eponymous solo album on Sanctuary Records. Around this time, he had shaven his long hair, in solidarity with a close family member who was battling cancer until her death.[32]
On November 6, 2012, Tate released his second solo record on InsideOut Music, entitled Kings and Thieves.
Other activities[edit]
Tate stars as the narrator and killer in the found footage horror movie The Burningmoore Incident. It was released direct-to-video on March 4, 2013.[33] Tate is scheduled to score the music to the in-production crime movie Fallen Moon.[34]
Tate is a wine enthusiast. He started making wine at age 14,[35] explaining: "I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn’t very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion."[36] The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensrÿche: "I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I’d make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing."[35] Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, "Insania".[37]
Controversy[edit]
Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy and criticism, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding and following the split with Queensrÿche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre[38]) and his control over the band during the 1997–2012 period, according to court declarations from his former bandmates.[39]
Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012.[40] Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd "You guys suck," which his bandmates, as well as fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration "I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them."[41] He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: "It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn’t respect the fans' type of thing."[36] He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: "I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate."[42]
Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche has also generated controversy due to the artwork of their album, Frequency Unknown. The abbreviation "F.U." is emphasized on the front cover, and is often used in English as a synonym for the profane expression "Fuck you". Tate, however, when asked about the meaning behind the artwork in an interview, responded with "Oh gosh, people read so much into everything. It's kind of funny, isn't it?"[43]
Also, during the "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" tour, on May 17, 2013, Tate created controversy during a show in St. Charles, Illinois. Ten minutes into the show, he grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.[44] Tate has not shown remorse, instead explaining that: "some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy]."[45] He has also accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.[42] In another instance, Tate spat on a fan from stage.[46]
Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the lawsuits, saying: "I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?"[42] He also added: "Because we’re in litigation there is a concerted effort to create a personality for me, to try and create a smear campaign really." and expressed belief that most negative comments about him on the internet are posted by the same, small group of people who use fake accounts to make it appear as though his detractors are much greater in number.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to "Jet City Woman."[47] In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans.[37] Tate has four daughters: Sabra, Miranda, Bella, and Emily. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger.
Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and as band manager from 2005-2012.[48] She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensrÿche's fanclub.[49] Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008,[50] while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensrÿche,[50][51] and on 18 July married Miranda,[52] but they divorced about half a year later.[53] Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensrÿche Cabaret.[54] Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song "Home Again" on the 2009 Queensrÿche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of "Silent Lucidity" for the album Frequency Unknown.[55]
Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing.[1]

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate,[1] January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey)[1][2][3] is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for "Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.[4][5][6][7]

Early years[edit]
Tate was born in Stuttgart,[1] which was then part of West Germany, to German American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans.[8] Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington.
Career[edit]
Queensrÿche (1982–2012)[edit]
While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensrÿche) at a local rock festival.[9] After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs.[1][9] Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensrÿche in 2012.[10]
The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future.[1] The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song "The Lady Wore Black", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensrÿche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.[11] Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.
Queensrÿche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983,[9] with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.[11] EMI re-released the EP, Queensrÿche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensrÿche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensrÿche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre.[12] Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005–2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensrÿche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name.[13] It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensrÿche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.[14]
Queensrÿche Featuring Geoff Tate (2012–2014)[edit]
Following his firing and while awaiting the outcome of a settlement or court ruling deciding who would ultimately gain access to the name Queensrÿche, Tate announced his own lineup using the name "Queensrÿche" on September 1, 2012 via his official Facebook page.[15]
Until Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche in April 2014 to the other band members, they were promoted by their booking agent under the name "Queensrÿche Starring Geoff Tate the Original Voice".[16] The lineup would originally feature Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer, Glen Drover,[17] and two of his former band mates from the band Myth; Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.[10][18] Drover left the band on November 23, 2012.[17] On January 25, 2013, his replacement was announced to be guitarist Robert Sarzo, while Blotzer was also replaced on drums by Simon Wright, who has remained since.[19]
The band embarked on an "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" on April 6, 2013, celebrating the album's 25th anniversary.[20] predominantly touring the American Southwest.[19] The tour continued through to September 2014 with several breaks, among others with Tate touring with his solo band in May 2014.[21]
As part of the settlement agreement, Tate was granted the exclusive rights to perform Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety as a unique performance, but not under the name Queensrÿche.[14]
Tate, however, presumably does not perceive his current project to be a similar band setting as the one he used to have with Queensrÿche before the 2012 split, saying: "I don't ever want to be in a band again. A 'band'-band that sticks together through thick and thin and all that, you know. I've already done that. I want to work with different groups of people. And I want to constantly be changing it up to make it interesting and different. And I want to play with as many great players as I possibly can."[22]









"Cold" (2013)

With this lineup, Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23 via through Deadline Music, a sub-label of Cleopatra Records.[23][24] It was co-written, produced and mixed in 6 weeks by Jason Slater[25] and mastered by Maor Appelbaum,[26] but Billy Sherwood was later hired to remix the album, "[as it] seems there are sonic issues with the previous versions".[27][28] Several days later, however, Sherwood pulled out of the project, citing scheduling issues.[29] The work was subsequently spread out over at least four remixers, because of the deadline that had to be met.[30] "Cold", the first single off Frequency Unknown was released on April 3, 2013.[31]
Operation: Mindcrime (2014-present)[edit]
Following his farewell tour as Queensryche, Tate renamed his band to Operation: Mindcrime after the Queensryche album of the same name. In 2015, John Moyer, Brian Tichy, and Scott Moughton became full-time members following the departures of Rudy Sarzo and Robert Sarzo. Their debut album, named The Key, which is part one of a three part trilogy, was released on September 18, 2015.[5]

Solo work[edit]
In 1985, Tate participated in the famine relief collaboration Hear 'n Aid.
In 2002, Tate released an eponymous solo album on Sanctuary Records. Around this time, he had shaven his long hair, in solidarity with a close family member who was battling cancer until her death.[32]
On November 6, 2012, Tate released his second solo record on InsideOut Music, entitled Kings and Thieves.
Other activities[edit]
Tate stars as the narrator and killer in the found footage horror movie The Burningmoore Incident. It was released direct-to-video on March 4, 2013.[33] Tate is scheduled to score the music to the in-production crime movie Fallen Moon.[34]
Tate is a wine enthusiast. He started making wine at age 14,[35] explaining: "I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn’t very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion."[36] The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensrÿche: "I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I’d make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing."[35] Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, "Insania".[37]
Controversy[edit]
Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy and criticism, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding and following the split with Queensrÿche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre[38]) and his control over the band during the 1997–2012 period, according to court declarations from his former bandmates.[39]
Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012.[40] Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd "You guys suck," which his bandmates, as well as fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration "I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them."[41] He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: "It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn’t respect the fans' type of thing."[36] He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: "I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate."[42]
Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche has also generated controversy due to the artwork of their album, Frequency Unknown. The abbreviation "F.U." is emphasized on the front cover, and is often used in English as a synonym for the profane expression "Fuck you". Tate, however, when asked about the meaning behind the artwork in an interview, responded with "Oh gosh, people read so much into everything. It's kind of funny, isn't it?"[43]
Also, during the "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" tour, on May 17, 2013, Tate created controversy during a show in St. Charles, Illinois. Ten minutes into the show, he grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.[44] Tate has not shown remorse, instead explaining that: "some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy]."[45] He has also accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.[42] In another instance, Tate spat on a fan from stage.[46]
Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the lawsuits, saying: "I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?"[42] He also added: "Because we’re in litigation there is a concerted effort to create a personality for me, to try and create a smear campaign really." and expressed belief that most negative comments about him on the internet are posted by the same, small group of people who use fake accounts to make it appear as though his detractors are much greater in number.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to "Jet City Woman."[47] In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans.[37] Tate has four daughters: Sabra, Miranda, Bella, and Emily. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger.
Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and as band manager from 2005-2012.[48] She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensrÿche's fanclub.[49] Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008,[50] while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensrÿche,[50][51] and on 18 July married Miranda,[52] but they divorced about half a year later.[53] Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensrÿche Cabaret.[54] Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song "Home Again" on the 2009 Queensrÿche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of "Silent Lucidity" for the album Frequency Unknown.[55]
Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing.[1]

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate,[1] January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey)[1][2][3] is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensrÿche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for "Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensrÿche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensrÿche album of the same name.[4][5][6][7]

Early years[edit]
Tate was born in Stuttgart,[1] which was then part of West Germany, to German American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans.[8] Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington.
Career[edit]
Queensrÿche (1982–2012)[edit]
While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensrÿche) at a local rock festival.[9] After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs.[1][9] Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensrÿche in 2012.[10]
The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future.[1] The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song "The Lady Wore Black", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensrÿche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.[11] Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.
Queensrÿche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983,[9] with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.[11] EMI re-released the EP, Queensrÿche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensrÿche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensrÿche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre.[12] Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005–2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensrÿche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name.[13] It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensrÿche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.[14]
Queensrÿche Featuring Geoff Tate (2012–2014)[edit]
Following his firing and while awaiting the outcome of a settlement or court ruling deciding who would ultimately gain access to the name Queensrÿche, Tate announced his own lineup using the name "Queensrÿche" on September 1, 2012 via his official Facebook page.[15]
Until Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche in April 2014 to the other band members, they were promoted by their booking agent under the name "Queensrÿche Starring Geoff Tate the Original Voice".[16] The lineup would originally feature Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer, Glen Drover,[17] and two of his former band mates from the band Myth; Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.[10][18] Drover left the band on November 23, 2012.[17] On January 25, 2013, his replacement was announced to be guitarist Robert Sarzo, while Blotzer was also replaced on drums by Simon Wright, who has remained since.[19]
The band embarked on an "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" on April 6, 2013, celebrating the album's 25th anniversary.[20] predominantly touring the American Southwest.[19] The tour continued through to September 2014 with several breaks, among others with Tate touring with his solo band in May 2014.[21]
As part of the settlement agreement, Tate was granted the exclusive rights to perform Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety as a unique performance, but not under the name Queensrÿche.[14]
Tate, however, presumably does not perceive his current project to be a similar band setting as the one he used to have with Queensrÿche before the 2012 split, saying: "I don't ever want to be in a band again. A 'band'-band that sticks together through thick and thin and all that, you know. I've already done that. I want to work with different groups of people. And I want to constantly be changing it up to make it interesting and different. And I want to play with as many great players as I possibly can."[22]









"Cold" (2013)

With this lineup, Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on April 23 via through Deadline Music, a sub-label of Cleopatra Records.[23][24] It was co-written, produced and mixed in 6 weeks by Jason Slater[25] and mastered by Maor Appelbaum,[26] but Billy Sherwood was later hired to remix the album, "[as it] seems there are sonic issues with the previous versions".[27][28] Several days later, however, Sherwood pulled out of the project, citing scheduling issues.[29] The work was subsequently spread out over at least four remixers, because of the deadline that had to be met.[30] "Cold", the first single off Frequency Unknown was released on April 3, 2013.[31]
Operation: Mindcrime (2014-present)[edit]
Following his farewell tour as Queensryche, Tate renamed his band to Operation: Mindcrime after the Queensryche album of the same name. In 2015, John Moyer, Brian Tichy, and Scott Moughton became full-time members following the departures of Rudy Sarzo and Robert Sarzo. Their debut album, named The Key, which is part one of a three part trilogy, was released on September 18, 2015.[5]

Solo work[edit]
In 1985, Tate participated in the famine relief collaboration Hear 'n Aid.
In 2002, Tate released an eponymous solo album on Sanctuary Records. Around this time, he had shaven his long hair, in solidarity with a close family member who was battling cancer until her death.[32]
On November 6, 2012, Tate released his second solo record on InsideOut Music, entitled Kings and Thieves.
Other activities[edit]
Tate stars as the narrator and killer in the found footage horror movie The Burningmoore Incident. It was released direct-to-video on March 4, 2013.[33] Tate is scheduled to score the music to the in-production crime movie Fallen Moon.[34]
Tate is a wine enthusiast. He started making wine at age 14,[35] explaining: "I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn’t very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion."[36] The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensrÿche: "I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I’d make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing."[35] Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, "Insania".[37]
Controversy[edit]
Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy and criticism, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding and following the split with Queensrÿche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre[38]) and his control over the band during the 1997–2012 period, according to court declarations from his former bandmates.[39]
Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in São Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012.[40] Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd "You guys suck," which his bandmates, as well as fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration "I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them."[41] He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: "It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn’t respect the fans' type of thing."[36] He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: "I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate."[42]
Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche has also generated controversy due to the artwork of their album, Frequency Unknown. The abbreviation "F.U." is emphasized on the front cover, and is often used in English as a synonym for the profane expression "Fuck you". Tate, however, when asked about the meaning behind the artwork in an interview, responded with "Oh gosh, people read so much into everything. It's kind of funny, isn't it?"[43]
Also, during the "Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour" tour, on May 17, 2013, Tate created controversy during a show in St. Charles, Illinois. Ten minutes into the show, he grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.[44] Tate has not shown remorse, instead explaining that: "some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy]."[45] He has also accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself.[42] In another instance, Tate spat on a fan from stage.[46]
Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the lawsuits, saying: "I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?"[42] He also added: "Because we’re in litigation there is a concerted effort to create a personality for me, to try and create a smear campaign really." and expressed belief that most negative comments about him on the internet are posted by the same, small group of people who use fake accounts to make it appear as though his detractors are much greater in number.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to "Jet City Woman."[47] In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans.[37] Tate has four daughters: Sabra, Miranda, Bella, and Emily. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger.
Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and as band manager from 2005-2012.[48] She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensrÿche's fanclub.[49] Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008,[50] while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensrÿche,[50][51] and on 18 July married Miranda,[52] but they divorced about half a year later.[53] Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensrÿche Cabaret.[54] Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song "Home Again" on the 2009 Queensrÿche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of "Silent Lucidity" for the album Frequency Unknown.[55]
Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing.[1]

                           We argue that managerial overconfidence can account for corporate investment distortions. Overconfident managers overestimate
                              the returns to their investment projects and view external funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant
                              internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing. We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using
                              panel data on personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify CEOs as overconfident
                              if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk. We find that investment of overconfident
                              CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow, particularly in equity-dependent firms

                           Overconfident CEOs over-estimate their ability to generate returns. Thus, on the margin, they undertake mergers that destroy
                              value. They also perceive outside finance to be over-priced. We classify CEOs as overconfident when, despite their under-diversification,
                              they hold options on company stock until expiration. We find that these CEOs are more acquisitive on average, particularly
                              via diversifying deals. The effects are largest in firms with abundant cash and untapped debt capacity. Using press coverage
                              as "confident" or "optimistic" to measure overconfidence confirms these results. We also find that the market reacts significantly
                              more negatively to takeover bids by overconfident managers

                           We show that financial experts on boards significantly affect corporate decisions, but not necessarily in the interest of
                              shareholders. Employing a novel director-level data set from 1988 to 2001, we find that, when commercial bankers enter a board,
                              loan size increases and investment-cash flow sensitivity decreases. However, the increased financing benefits mostly financially
                              unconstrained firms with good credit but poor investment opportunities. Investment bankers on boards are associated with larger
                              public debt issues and worse acquisitions. Among financial experts without bank affiliation, finance professors increase the
                              size of CEO option grants, reducing, however, the sensitivity of total compensation to performance

                           Many financing choices of US corporations remain puzzling even after accounting for standard determinants such as taxes, bankruptcy
                              costs, and asymmetric information. We propose that managerial beliefs help to explain the remaining variation across and within
                              firms, including variation in debt conservatism and in pecking-order behavior. Managers who believe that their company is
                              undervalued view external financing as overpriced, especially equity financing. As a result, they display pecking-order preferences
                              for internal financing over debt and for debt over equity. They may also exhibit debt conservatism: While they prefer debt
                              to equity, they still underutilize debt relative to its tax benefits. We test these hypotheses empirically, using late option
                              exercise by the CEO as a measure of overconfidence. We find that, conditional on accessing public markets, CEOs who personally
                              overinvest in their companies are significantly less likely to issue equity. They raise 33 cents more debt to cover an additional
                              dollar of financing deficit than their peers. Moreover, the frequency with which they access any external finance (debt or
                              equity) is significantly lower, resulting in debt conservatism. The results replicate when identifying managerial overconfidence
                              based on press portrayal as confident or optimistic. We conclude that managerial overconfidence helps to explain variation
                              in corporate financial policies

                           Compensation, status, and press coverage of managers in the U.S. follow a highly skewed distribution: a small number of 'superstars'
                              enjoy the bulk of the rewards. We evaluate the impact of CEOs achieving superstar status on the performance of their firms,
                              using prestigious business awards to measure shocks to CEO status. We find that award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform,
                              both relative to their prior performance and relative to a matched sample of non-winning CEOs. At the same time, they extract
                              more compensation following the award, both in absolute amounts and relative to other top executives in their firms. They
                              also spend more time on public and private activities outside their companies, such as assuming board seats or writing books.
                              The incidence of earnings management increases after winning awards. The effects are strongest in firms with weak governance,
                              even though the frequency of obtaining superstar status is independent of corporate governance. Our results suggest that the
                              ex-post consequences of media-induced superstar status for shareholders are negative

                           We measure the impact of individual managerial beliefs on corporate financing. First, managers who believe that their firm
                              is undervalued view external financing as overpriced, especially equity. We show that such overconfident managers use less
                              external finance and, conditional on accessing risky capital, issue less equity than their peers. Second, CEOs with Depression
                              experience have less faith in capital markets and lean excessively on internal financing. Third, CEOs with military experience
                              pursue more aggressive policies, including heightened leverage. CEOs' press portrayals confirm these differences in beliefs.
                              Overall, measurable managerial characteristics have significant explanatory power beyond traditional capital-structure determinants

                           The composition and functioning of corporate boards is at the core of the academic and policy debate on optimal corporate
                              governance. But does board composition matter for corporate decisions? In this paper, we analyze the role of financial experts
                              on boards. In a novel panel data set on board composition, we find that financial experts significantly affect corporate decisions,
                              though not necessarily in the interest of shareholders. First, when commercial bankers join boards, external funding increases
                              and investment-cash flow sensitivity diminishes. But, the increased financing affects mostly firms with good credit and poor
                              investment opportunities. Second, investment bankers on the board are associated with larger bond issues, but also worse acquisitions.
                              Third, we find little evidence that financial expertise matters for compensation policy or for experts without affiliation
                              to a financial institution. The results suggest a tradeoff between outside incentives (e.g. bank profits) and the incentive
                              to maximize firm value. Requiring financial expertise on boards, as mandated by regulatory proposals, may not benefit shareholders
                              if conflicting interests are neglected

                              "We measure the impact of individual managerial beliefs on corporate financing. First, managers who believe that their firm
                                 is undervalued view external financing as overpriced, especially equity. We show that such overconfident managers use less
                                 external finance and, conditional on accessing risky capital, issue less equity than their peers. Second, CEOs with Depression
                                 experience have less faith in capital markets and lean excessively on internal financing. Third, CEOs with military experience
                                 pursue more aggressive policies, including heightened leverage. CEOs' press portrayals confirm these differences in beliefs.
                                 Overall, measurable managerial characteristics have significant explanatory power beyond traditional capital-structure determinants"--National

Know Your Product: Geoff Tate 
Stars Pick Their Top 5! This week: Geoff Tate

            By Brett Callwood

Geoff Tate 2017.





        For two decades, from 1982 to 2012, Geoff Tate was the frontman with Seattle prog-metalers Queensrÿche, a group which, you'll note, hit mad mainstream success on albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and singles like "Jet City Woman" and "Eyes of a Stranger." Tate was fired from the band in 2012 (sacrilege!), and replaced by former Crimson Glory man Todd La Torre. He kept at it though, initially going out as "Queensrÿche featuring Geoff Tate," then changing the name of the band to "Operation: Mindcrime." Now he's put the troublesome monikers behind him and he's solo, performing Queensryche tunage acoustically, and he's bringing the show to this one-horse town this week. We hit him up for the five albums that changed his life ...  


Sunday, March 5 at The Rialto Theatre, 318 E. Congress St. 8 p.m. $27-$29. All Ages.

1. Jefferson Airplane—Surrealistic Pillow: When I was nine, I wanted to be a musician, and primarily that's because I started hearing music for the first time around that age. I got a transistor radio for my birthday, and that just tuned me into pop music happening at the time. I heard the song "Somebody to Love," that really made me ask my parents about how to learn to play music. I started taking piano lessons after that.  

 click to enlarge      

2. The Beatles—Meet The Beatles: Meet the Beatles was the first album I ever bought. The Beatles were incredibly inspirational for a young musician, because they offered so much variety, and so much sing-along factor to what they wrote. You could interpret it easily. They had a really good way of taking complex musicality and channeling it into a direct way to really communicate with people. Even people like me at the time, who weren't trained musicians and were just growing into it.

3. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young—Déjà Vu: The 1970s was an amazing decade for music. Growing up the '60s and '70s, you were exposed to lots of different music, because it was a very free time with rock music. There weren't all these boxes and boundaries called genres, limiting what we hear and limiting bands' creativity. For me, an album like Déjà Vu was incredibly important musically. I think the reason was I was learning about harmony at that time, and they sung so beautifully in harmony. They used it in such a unique way that I was really drawn to that.

4. Yes—Close to the Edge: I really got into people like Rick Wakeman and what he was doing on keyboards. Keith Emerson from ELP. These guys really affected me musically, and thus I was heavily influenced by Close to the Edge, which I still listen to today, trying to figure out what they were doing there. It's just an incredible piece of music.

5. Trevor Jones—Angel Heart OST: The film starred Mickey Rourke in the '80s. A brilliant film, and the music is incredible. Really unique. Jones was the main composer, and he had a saxophone player that did a lot of soloing throughout the soundtrack. Courtney Pine, he's an incredible player. Really haunting, unique arrangements, done kind of like mixing classical styles with more of a jazz presentation. That album had a huge impact on me.

The author  recounts his search for  God step-by-step in readily understandable terms.  He has found God through an examination of the miraculous facts which surround us - not by any blind Faith.  Using non-sectarian arguments and reasoning he has built upon basic truths to construct the foundations for common belief and greater tolerance of others.

This book is aimed at readers in any of three categories; those strong and committed believers in a religion - any religion - or equally strong non-believers. The third category covers agnostics i.e. “a person who holds that knowledge of a Supreme Being, ultimate cause etc is impossible”

Seven  deceptively fundamental  “Steps” lead to conclusions which are both far-reaching and unavoidable.  He maintains that although each of us is unique, each is also an essential part of Creation with a very definite purpose both in this life and the immortality which awaits us all.

Only man-made ritual and intolerance of... More > others hinders our progress towards Elysium.< Less

                    By Geoffrey Tate
                

                                        Sep 7, 2013
                


                                What was there before the "Big Bang"? Nothing? Was it random chance or the work of a creator? And what is our ultimate destiny? These and many other questions have occupied the Author over a long and eventful life. After some 60 years of probing, his conclusions are clearly written with moving compassion and faith in humanity. The reader's thinking is challenged throughout by close arguments and practical reasoning throughout this fascinating journey. The outcome emerging is even more thought provoking.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
