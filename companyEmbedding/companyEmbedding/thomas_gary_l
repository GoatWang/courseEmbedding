Sacred Marriage 
What If God Designed Marriage to Make Us Holy More Than to Make Us Happy?


Thomas, Gary L. (Author)	
									        	
									




Sacred Marriage doesn't just offer techniques to make a marriage happier. It helps readers become holier husbands and wives. The revised edition has been streamlined to be a faster read without losing depth.




Description


Happy is good. Holy is better.Your marriage is more than a sacred covenant with another person. It is a spiritual discipline designed to help you know God better, trust him more fully, and love him more deeply.  What if God’s primary intent for your marriage isn’t to make you happy . . . but holy?Sacred Marriage doesn't just offer techniques to make a marriage happier. It does contain practical tools, but what married Christians most need is help in becoming holier husbands and wives. Sacred Marriage offers that help with insights from Scripture, church history, time tested wisdom from Christian classics, and examples from today's marriages.Sacred Marriage reveals how marriage trains us to love God and others well, how it exposes sin and makes us more aware of God's presence, how good marriages foster good prayer, how married sex feeds the spiritual life, and more.The revised edition of Sacred Marriage takes into account the ways men's and women's roles have expanded since the book was first written. It has been streamlined to be a faster read without losing the depth that so many readers have valued.Sacred Marriage uncovers the mystery of God’s overarching purpose. This book may very well alter profoundly the contours of your marriage. It will most certainly change you. Because whether it is delightful or difficult, your marriage can become a doorway to a closer walk with God, and to a spiritual integrity that, like salt, seasons the world around you with the savor of Christ.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Most married couples survive by gritting their teeth and holding on. However, as Gary Thomas reveals in this six-session video Bible study (guide sold separately), couples can not only survive but actually thrive in marriage when they learn how to cherish one another. This simple practice of cherishingnoticing, appreciating, honoring, and encouraging one anothercan reverse old patterns of "going through the motions" and bring hope and life into every marriage. Sessions include:  To Love and to Cherish (20 min) Your Honor (25 min) Taking Your Marriage to the Next Level (23 min) Cherishing Your Unique Spouse (21 min) This Is How Your Spouse Stumbles (22 min) Keep on Cherishing (24 min)  Designed for use with the Cherish Study Guide (sold separately).


Author Bio▼▲
Gary Thomas is Writer in Residence and serves on the teaching team at Second Baptist Church, Houston, Texas and the author of 18 books that have sold more than a million copies worldwide and have been translated into a dozen languages. He and his wife, Lisa, have been married for 30 years.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Millions of couples getting married have pledged to "love and to cherish, until death do us part." Most of us understand and get the love part... but what does it mean to cherish our spouse? Why do we say it once at the wedding and then rarely even mention it again? In this six-session video Bible study, bestselling author Gary Thomas draws on personal stories and teachings from the Bible to show how cherishing can have a powerful effect on marriage. Learning to truly cherish each other turns marriage from an obligation into a delight. It lifts marriage above a commitment to a precious priority. Cherish is the melody that makes a marriage sing. Many couples today survive by gritting their teeth and holding on. Or they find themselves just "going through the motions" in their relationship. But cherishing our spouse can reverse this pattern. Cherishing can breathe light, hope, and new life into a marriageeven one marred by neglect and disrespect. The Cherish Study Guide includes video discussion questions, Bible exploration, and personal study and reflection materials for in-between sessions. Sessions include:  To Love and to Cherish Your Honor Taking Your Marriage to the Next Level Cherishing Your Unique Spouse This Is How Your Spouse Stumbles Keep on Cherishing  This pack contains one softcover study guide and one DVD.

 Most marriages survive by gritting teeth and holding on. But marriages can and will not only survive but thrive when husbands and wives learn to cherish one another. Those are the powerful words of bestselling author Gary Thomas in his newest book Cherish. And in a world desperate for marriage redemption, it is needed now more than ever. Thomas shows that although there are a countless number of marriages consisting of two people just going through the motions, there are real ways this pattern can be reversed: when husbands and wives learn to cherish one another in proven, loving, and everyday actions and words. Through personal stories and real world examples, Thomas proves what husbands and wives can begin doing today to turn their marriage around even a marriage marred by neglect and disrespect. So how do you cherish your spouse? Thomas will show you how going out of your way to notice them, appreciate them, honor them, encourage them, and hold them close to your heart will bring hope, light, and life into your marriage."

Cherish 
The One Word That Changes Everything for Your Marriage


Thomas, Gary (Author)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Thomas, Gary L. (Author)	
									        	
									




A countless number of marriages right now consist of two people just going through the motions.




Description


“Most marriages survive by gritting teeth and holding on. But marriages can and will not only survive but thrive when husbands and wives learn to cherish one another.” Those are the powerful words of bestselling author Gary Thomas in his newest book—Cherish. And in a world desperate for marriage redemption, it is needed now more than ever. Thomas shows that although there are a countless number of marriages consisting of two people just going through the motions, there are real ways this pattern can be reversed: when husbands and wives learn to cherish one another in proven, loving, and everyday actions and words. Through personal stories and real world examples, Thomas proves what husbands and wives can begin doing today to turn their marriage around—even a marriage marred by neglect and disrespect. So how do you cherish your spouse? Thomas will show you how going out of your way to notice them, appreciate them, honor them, encourage them, and hold them close to your heart will bring hope, light, and life into your marriage.
