﻿Investment strategy﻿








﻿MIAC currently has two investments: a 100% ownership of Millennium HI Carbon, an activated carbon biomass plant in Hawaii, and an approximately 10.5% stake in SMC Global, an Indian financial services company.MIAC's investment in Millennium HI Carbon is an exciting start to MIAC's new strategy of investing in alternative energy assets.  MIAC has revised its investment strategy including moving away from its India-investment focus and is exploring options to realize value from its investment in SMC Global. We believe the outlook for creating shareholder value is promising.

	SMC
	GLOBAL SECURITIES LIMITED






	NOTES
	TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



	(All amounts in Indian rupees unless otherwise stated)






	 








	1.






	Reporting
	entity

	Basis
	of preparation








	 










	(a)






	Statement
	of compliance








	 





	These
	interim condensed consolidated financial statements (referred to as ‘Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements’)
	have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ,“Interim Financial Reporting” and should be read in conjunction with
	the Group’s last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2016 (‘last annual
	financials statements’). These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as at September 30, 2016 and for the six months
	ended September 30, 2016 comprise Parent Company together with its subsidiaries (Collectively “the Company” or “the
	Group”). They do not include all of the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected
	explanatory notes are included to explain the events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes
	in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements.




	These
	Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for the issue by the Company’s Audit Committee on January 13,
	2017.




	 




	The
	accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those followed
	in the preparation of the Group’s last annual Financial Statements except the following.

	SMC
	GLOBAL SECURITIES LIMITED






	NOTES
	TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



	(All amounts in Indian rupees unless otherwise stated)





	 





	Income
	tax expense






	 





	Income
	tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax expense is recognized in the Statement of Profit or
	Loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or Other Comprehensive
	Income (OCI), in which case it is recognized in equity or in OCI.




	 




	The
	Group calculates the period income tax expense using the tax rate that would be applicable to the expected total




	annual
	earnings. The Group consolidated effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2015 is 31.99% and September 30, 2016
	is 20.83%




	 




	Deferred
	tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
	purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes




	 





	Business
	combinations, goodwill and other intangible assets





	 




	The
	Group accounts for its “Business combinations” using the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable
	tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured
	at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.




	 




	Goodwill
	represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased.
	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, based on a number of factors, including operating
	results, business plans and future cash flows.




	 




	Intangible
	assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets or in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated
	amortization based on their estimated useful lives as follows:




	 




	Customer-related
	intangible assets 8 years




	 




	Intangible
	assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the




	pattern
	in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized.




	 




	At
	each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication
	of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually
	for impairment.




	 





	Share-based
	compensation






	 





	The
	grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognised as an expense,
	with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted
	to reflect the number of awards for which the related service conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately
	recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service conditions at the vesting date.




	 





	Interests
	in equity-accounted investees





	 




	The
	Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interest in a joint venture.




	 




	A
	joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement,
	rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.

	SMC
	GLOBAL SECURITIES LIMITED






	NOTES
	TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



	(All amounts in Indian rupees unless otherwise stated)





	 




	Interest
	in joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction
	costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit
	or loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.




	 









	(b)






	Basis
	of measurement








	 





	The
	Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following material
	items in the condensed consolidated financial statements:




	 





	 



	●




	Trading
	assets and trading liabilities (including derivatives), inventories and investment securities are measured at fair value.






	 









	(c)






	Functional
	and presentation currency








	 





	These
	Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in INR, which is the Company’s and its subsidiaries functional
	currency, other than SMC Comex International, DMCC, a subsidiary of the Company in United Arab Emirates and SMC Global USA Inc.,
	a subsidiary of the Company in United States of America. The functional currency of SMC Comex International, DMCC and SMC Global
	USA Inc. is U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of SMC Comex International, DMCC and SMC Global USA Inc. are translated at period-end
	rates of exchange, and income statement accounts are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Gains or losses resulting
	from such transactions are recognised in “Other comprehensive income” and shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity
	as “Foreign currency translation reserve”.




	 




	The
	accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, the national currency of India. Solely
	for the convenience of the readers, the financial statements as at and for the six months ended September 30, 2016 have been translated
	into U.S. dollars which are based on the exchange rate as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board
	at September 30, 2016. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York certifies this rate for customs purposes in a weekly version of the
	H.10 release. The exchange rate as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board as at September 30,
	2016 was INR 66.58 per US$1. No representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have been, could have been or could be converted
	into U.S. dollars at such a rate or any other rate.




	 









	(d)






	Use
	of estimates and judgments








	 





	The
	preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,
	estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
	income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.




	 




	Estimates
	and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in
	which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.




	 





	 



	A)




	Information
	about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the
	next financial year are as follows:






	 





	Measurement
	of defined benefit obligation, liability for long-service leave; key actuarial assumptions:






	 





	The
	projected benefit obligation and expense related to the Group’s pension and non-pension post-retirement benefit plans are
	determined using multiple assumptions that may significantly influence the value of these amounts. Actuarial assumptions including
	discount rates, compensation increases, attrition rates and mortality rates are management’s best estimates and are reviewed
	annually with the Group’s actuaries. The Group develops each assumption using relevant historical experience of the Group
	in conjunction with market related data and considers if the market-related data indicates there is any prolonged or significant
	impact on the assumptions. The discount rate used to measure plan obligations is based on long-term high quality government bond
	yields. The other assumptions are also long-term estimates. All assumptions are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Differences
	between actual experiences and the assumptions, as well as changes in the assumptions resulting from changes in future expectations,
	result in actuarial gains and losses which are recognized in other comprehensive income during the period and also impact expenses
	in future periods.

	NOTES
	TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



	(All amounts in Indian rupees unless otherwise stated)





	 





	Recognition
	of deferred tax assets, availability of future taxable profit against which carry-forward losses can be used:






	 





	Deferred
	tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates
	that have been enacted or substantively enacted. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
	of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible.
	The Group considers the expected reversal of deferred tax assets and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
	The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of
	future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.




	 





	Impairment
	of trade receivable and loan and advance to customers:






	 





	The
	Group estimates the uncollectability of trade receivables and loans and advances to customers by analyzing historical payment
	patterns, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. If the financial condition of a customer
	deteriorates, additional allowances may be required.




	 






	 




	B)




	Information
	about significant areas of judgment in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized
	in the condensed consolidated financial statements are described as follows:






	 





	Principal
	and agent relationship:






	 





	The
	Group determines that when other parties are involved in providing goods or services to an Group’s customer, whether its
	performance obligation is to provide the goods or services itself (i.e., the Group is a principal) or to arrange for another party
	to provide the good or service (i.e., the Group is an agent). The Group is a principal if it controls a promised good or service
	before it transfers the good or service to a customer. However, the Group is not necessarily acting as a principal if it obtains
	legal title only momentarily before the good or service is transferred to a customer.




	 




	The
	determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent affects the amount of revenue the Group recognizes.




	 




	When
	the Group is the principal in the arrangement, revenue to be recognized is based on the gross amount to which the entity expects
	to be entitled.




	 




	When
	the Group is the agent, the revenue to be recognized is the net amount to which the entity is entitled to retain in return for
	its services as the agent.




	 




	The
	Group acts in its principal capacity for trading activity undertaken on its own account, whereas it is an agent for all trading
	positions taken by its clients.




	 







	3.






	New
	standards and interpretation not yet adopted








	 






	IFRS
	9 Financial Instruments:

	IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
	and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected
	credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries
	forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.

	The
	Standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a
	contract i.e., the lessee and the lessor. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise
	assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. Currently,
	operating lease expenses are charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The Standard also contains
	enhanced disclosure requirements for lessees. The effective date for adoption of IFRS 16 is annual periods beginning on or after
	January 1, 2019, though early adoption is permitted for companies applying IFRS 15

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	Financial
	risk management








	 





	This
	note presents the information about the Group’s exposure to financial risks, the group’s objectives, policies and
	processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further, quantitative disclosures are included
	throughout these condensed consolidated financial statements.





	 





	The
	Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:




	 






	 



	●



	Credit
	risk;

	Financial
	Risk management framework





	 




	The
	Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
	Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies and guidelines approved by the management. The Board has established
	a Risk Management Committee which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. Group
	policies and guidelines cover areas such as cash management, investment of excess funds and raising of debt and are managed by
	segregated functions within the Group.




	 




	The
	Group’s risk management policies and procedures are established to identify and analysis the risks faced by the Group, to
	set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are
	reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and
	management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees
	and stakeholders understand their roles and obligations.





	 






	Different
	types of risks arising from financial instruments as identified by the Group above have been explained below:






	 







	 





	4.1






	Credit
	risk







	 




	The
	credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
	contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trading assets except equity instruments, investment securities
	except equity instruments, receivables from clients and exchanges, loans and advance to customers, balances with banks and term
	deposits and related accrued interest. Credit risk in respect of quoted securities is expected to have a direct correlation with
	the quoted market prices and risk.




	 




	The
	Group is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe money or securities will not perform their obligations. Such third parties
	include clients, trading members, exchanges, clearing houses, and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on
	their obligations owed to the Group due to insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, government or other regulatory
	intervention or other reasons. In these circumstances, the Group is exposed to risks arising, for example, from holding securities
	of third parties; executing securities trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty
	trading members, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Significant failures by third parties to timely
	perform their obligations owed could materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial position, and ability to borrow
	in the credit markets and ability to operate the business.




	 




	For
	the risk management purposes, the Group considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposures such as individual obligator
	default risk, country and sector risk.

	The
	Group faces significant credit risk in its financing business as there is a risk of default on a loan that may arise from a borrower
	failing to make required contractual repayments.





	 






	Management
	/ mitigation of credit risk





	 




	The
	Group operates in a highly regulated environment which limits its credit risk against exchanges and clearing houses. The Group
	collects upfront margins in form of funds and/or securities/commodities from clients and trading members against their trading
	positions. The Group monitors positions, margins, mark to market losses and risks on real time basis through risk management systems
	and policies specially designed to mitigate the credit risk.




	 




	The
	Company’s Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk to the Risk Management Committee
	(“the Committee”). The Committee is responsible for management of the Group’s credit risk, including the following:




	 






	 




	(i)





	Formulating
	credit policies

	in consultation with business units, covering collateral requirements, credit assessment, risk grading
	and reporting, documentary and legal procedures, and compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(ii)





	Establishing
	the organizational structure

	for the approval of new customers or counter parties. Authorization limits are allocated
	to business unit credit officers or the Arbitrager as appropriate.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(iii)





	Providing
	advice, guidance and specialist skills

	to business units through periodic reviews to promote best practices throughout
	the Group in the management of credit risk.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(iv)




	The
	Committee assesses the credit worthiness of client or counterparties, prior to taking exposure on them. Accordingly, limits
	are assigned and the monitoring mechanism ensures that exposure to single client does not cross the laid down threshold limits.
	Collateral securities are also collected from clients to cover the exposure.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(v)




	Limiting
	concentrations of exposure to counterparties, geographies and industries (for loans and advances and similar exposures), and
	by issuer, credit rating band, market liquidity and country (for investment securities and trading assets).






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(vi)




	Reviewing
	compliance of business units with agreed exposure limits, including those for selected industries, country risk and product
	types. Regular reports on the credit quality of local portfolios are provided to the management, which may require appropriate
	corrective action to be taken.







	 





	For
	the Group’s financing business, a loan policy has been implemented to identify the broad principles which the Group will
	follow to accept borrowers and loan proposals, to manage loan portfolio, and recover its dues so as to minimize the inherent risks
	in the business activity and maximize business revenues with consumer satisfaction. To reduce the credit risk in financing, the
	Group performs a credit check on the prospective borrower or seek security over some assets of the borrower or a guarantee from
	a third party.




	 




	Unsecured
	Loans are sanctioned based on various factors like financials analysis, credit history, market references, and historical client
	relation with SMC Group & future business prospects. All these loans are continuously monitored basis the factors considered
	while sanctioning the loan.




	 




	Further
	Trade & Other receivables (no collateral) primarily includes undue receivables from exchanges/ clearing corporations, receivables
	from vendors on account of third party financials products, deposit with other brokers, security deposits with exchanges / clearing
	corporations etc. which are recovered in due course. If there are any indicators of impairment on management assessment of these
	unsecured balances, the same are provided for.While considering loan proposals, the Group also manages risk through limiting concentration
	of exposure to individual borrowers, industry, underlying collateral, etc.

	and risk management systems. The company conducts regular internal audits of various business units to find problems within the
	Group’s processes, quality control, fraud prevention and legal compliance. The internal audit reports are reviewed by internal

	a.






	Balances
	with banks, term deposits and accrued interest







	 




	The
	Group places its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits with banks with “high investment grade ratings”. The
	Group limits the amount of credit exposure with one bank and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the banks
	with which it does business. Given the high credit ratings of these financial institutions, the Group does not expect these financial
	institutions to fail in meeting their obligations.




	 






	 





	b.






	Trading
	assets and investment securities








	 





	Trading
	assets include portfolio of shares, derivative assets and debt securities/preference shares. Investment securities comprise portfolio
	of equity and debt securities/preference shares. The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of debt securities/preference
	shares and derivative assets. The trading assets and investment securities are valued at market price prevailing at reporting
	date which represents the fair value.




	 




	The
	table below sets out the credit quality of debt securities/preference shares. An analysis of the credit quality of the maximum
	credit exposure, based on ratings done by approved rating agencies where applicable, is as follows:

	(b)




	To
	diversify our risk, our loan policy also places concentration limits on the loans that we may offer.






	 




	The
	exposure-ceiling limit for a single borrower or business group is 15% of net owned funds (subject to regulations of RBI in India)
	of Moneywise Financial Services Private Limited, a subsidiary of the Group. This limit may be exceeded, in exceptional circumstances,
	by an additional 10% (i.e. upto 25%) with the approval of our loan committee.




	 




	The
	exposure-ceiling limit against a single security/commodity (aggregated across all borrowers) is 15% of net owned funds of Moneywise
	Financial Services Private Limited, a subsidiary of the Group. This limit may be exceeded, in exceptional circumstances, by an
	additional 5% (i.e. up to 20%) with the approval of loan committee. This exposure-ceiling limit is not applicable in the case
	of public issue financing loans provided that the exposure to a single borrower does not exceed 0.5% of net owned funds.





	 







	Collateral
	held and other credit enhancements:






	 




	The
	Group holds collateral and other credit enhancements against certain of its credit exposures. The table below sets out the principal
	types of collateral held against different types of financial assets.

	Loan
	to Value (LTV) for loan and advances to customer:






	 




	The
	general creditworthiness of a customer tends to be the most relevant indicator of credit quality of a loan extended to it. However,
	collateral provides additional security and the Group generally requests borrowers to provide it. The Group may take collateral
	in the form of a charge over real estate, floating charges over pledge of securities or other assets and other liens and guarantees.

	The
	tables below stratify credit exposures from secured loans and advances to customers by ranges of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. LTV
	is calculated as the ratio of the gross amount of the loan-to the value of the collateral. The gross amounts exclude any impairment
	allowance. The valuation of the collateral excludes any adjustments for obtaining and selling the collateral.

	The
	management has created collective allowance amounting to INR 6,388,978 and INR 5,786,890 and individual allowance amounting
	to INR 3,824,026 and INR 3,824,026 for impairment as on March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016 respectively.






	 




	The
	ratios presented above for loans against shares and application financing are based on collateral value as of the reporting date
	and for loan against property and Housing application financing the collateral value are of origination subject to revision in
	value of collateral, if deemed necessary due to market condition.




	 






	Impairment
	Losses:






	 




	The
	Group establishes allowance for impairment losses that represents its best estimate of incurred losses for receivables from clients/trading
	members and loans and advances to customers, which are carried at amortized cost. The main components of this allowance are a
	specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups
	of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.

	Liquidity
	risk








	 





	Liquidity
	risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that
	are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group companies require sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations.
	Individual companies are generally responsible for their own fund management, including the short-term investment of surpluses
	and the raising of loans to cover deficits from third parties/group companies.

	The
	Group’s primary liquidity requirements are to finance the working capital needs, which are typically towards margin maintenance
	at various exchanges. The principal portion of the working capital requirement is utilized by:




	 






	 




	(a)




	depositing
	funds with banks to obtain term deposits and guarantees towards margins payable to the exchanges/clearing houses;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(b)




	payments
	to stock exchanges/clearing houses towards settlement obligations;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(c)




	payment
	towards purchase of various trading assets;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(d)




	disbursement
	of loans to customers; and





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(e)




	meeting
	expenses incurred for operations.







	 






	Management
	of liquidity risk





	 




	Working
	capital requirements fluctuate on a regular basis depending on the business requirements. The Group’s approach to managing
	liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible to have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed
	conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group’s reputation.




	 




	To
	fund the working capital requirements, the Group currently relies principally on internal accruals and short term credit facilities
	from banks and financial institutions against pledge of trading assets except derivative assets, term deposits, receivables from
	clients and inventories. By maintaining sufficient liquid funds and drawing facilities with banks, the Group comfortably meets
	the foreseeable liabilities in the present and immediate future, as well as unforeseeable contingencies.




	 




	Central
	treasury receives information from business units regarding the liquidity profile of their financial assets and liabilities and
	projected cash flows. Central treasury maintains surplus funds in cash and cash equivalents including term deposits with banks
	and in investment securities for which there is an active and liquid market. These assets can be readily sold to meet liquidity
	requirements. Hence, the Group believes that the above monetary mechanism adequately addresses the liquidity risk.




	 




	The
	Group has committed approved credit facilities which it can be accessed to meet liquidity needs. As at the period end, the unutilised
	overdraft facilities with banks amounts to INR 3,500,715,000 and INR 3,551,700,000 as at March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016
	respectively.

	The
	Group participates in trading and investing in various assets classes such as equity, debt securities, commodities, foreign currency
	and derivatives. These assets classes experience volatility due to economic growth levels, inflation, prices, interest rates,
	foreign exchange rates and other macro-economic factors. Any changes in market prices of these asset classes will affect the Group’s
	income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

	risk levels to which the individual trader must adhere to and real time continuous monitoring by the senior management.



	 



	In
	respect of the proprietary positions, the Group is exposed to volatility in the price of the underlying securities.

	The
	Group engages in proprietary transactions into equities, commodities and derivatives (equities, commodities and currencies). These
	transactions are primarily undertaken using various arbitrage models to capitalize pricing inefficiencies in the markets. Any
	change in the market prices of their underlying would result in changes in the fair value of these trading assets, trading liabilities
	and inventory and also result in profit/loss on futures positions. An increase of underlying prices by 5% for the exposures at
	March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, with all other variables held constant, would decrease/(increase) the profit before tax
	by INR 12,872,444 and INR (11,539,438) for the year ended March 31, 2016 and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively
	and similarly a decrease/(increase) in underlying prices by 5% will increase profit before tax by INR 7,418,919 and INR (17,269,229)
	for the year ended March 31, 2016 and for the six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In case of options, the Group
	uses Black Scholes pricing model to estimate the potential impact on profit or loss arising from movement in the prices of underlying.

	Interest
	rate risk








	 




	Interest
	rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have effects on the Group’s net income or financial position.
	Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expenses resulting from interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
	Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
	changes in market interest rates.




	 




	The
	Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the loans taken from banks, investment in term deposits placed with banks,
	investment in debt securities and investments of its excess funds in liquid instruments. A majority of the financing of the Group
	has come from overdraft facility with banks. The business of the Group is exposed to fluctuation in interest rate for the following
	activities:




	 






	 




	(i)




	Term
	deposits placed with banks are generally for short term on fixed interest rates;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(ii)




	Facilities
	availed from banks and other financial institutions generally include short term working capital loans on floating interest
	rates;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(iii)




	Interest
	paid by Group on clients’ funds earmarked as fixed margin are generally for short term on fixed interest rates;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	(iv)




	Loans
	and advances on fixed rate basis expose the Group to interest rate risk.






	 






	Management
	of Interest Rate Risk






	 




	Interest
	rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and by having pre-approved limits for re-pricing bands.
	However the Group does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk.




	 




	The
	Group’s investments in majority of term deposits with banks are for both short and long duration, and therefore do not expose
	the group to significant interest rate risk. Further significant portion of exposure on term deposits with banks is offset with
	clients’ funds earmarked as margins on fixed rate basis. The interest rates on the overdraft facility availed are marginally
	higher than the interest rates on term deposits with the banks and generally linked to the term deposit rates with the bank. Accordingly,
	there is limited interest rate risk exposure on the company.




	 




	Interest
	from the customers on loans given is fixed rate of interest. In order to manage interest rate risk exposure, our loan portfolio
	can be classified between on demand loans and term loans. However, the interest rate risk exposure on short term loans is insignificant.
	We are exposed to fair value interest rate risk on fixed rate loans.




	 




	The
	Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s short-term and long-term
	debt obligations with floating / fixed interest rates, which are included in loans and borrowings in the


	condensed

	consolidated financial statements. The loans and borrowings as of March 31, 2016 and September
	30, 2016 represent loans and borrowing taken both fixed and floating interest rate.

	Cash
	flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments






	 





	An
	increase in interest rate by 1% on outstanding balance as at March 31, 2016 and September 30,2016, with all other variables held
	constant, will decrease profit before tax by INR 14,401,642 and INR 9,258,723 for the year ended March 31, 2016 and six months
	ended September 30, 2016, respectively. A decrease in interest rate by 1% on outstanding balance as at March 31, 2016 and September
	30, 2016 will have an equal but opposite impact on profit before tax for the periods then ended. This analysis assumes that all
	other variables such as foreign currency exchange rate, regulatory requirements etc, remain constant.




	 





	Fair
	value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments






	 





	Based
	on the outstanding balances as at March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, an increase in annual interest rate by 1%, with all other
	variables held constant, would have decreased profit before tax by INR 27,930,075 and INR 18,297,378 for the year ended March
	31, 2016 and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. A decrease in interest rate by 1% outstanding balance as at March
	31, 2016 and September 30, 2016 will have had an equal but opposite impact on profit before tax for the periods then ended. This
	analysis assumes that all other variables such as foreign currency exchange rate, regulatory requirements etc, remain constant.

	Currency
	risk








	 




	The
	Group is not significantly exposed to currency risk as there is no mismatch between the currencies in which sales of services,
	purchase of goods/services and borrowings are dominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. Further,
	the functional currencies of the Group companies are primarily the Indian Rupee and U.S. dollars and do not expose the group to
	significant currency risk. The Group considers the valuation changes in foreign currency derivatives it trades in as part of investment/price
	risk as those derivatives are exchange traded, managed and monitored based on exchange price and are settled in near term in Indian
	Rupees.

	Fair
	Values







	 




	A
	number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and
	non-financial assets and liabilities.




	 




	The
	Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The Group Chief Financial Officer has
	overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements, including level 3 fair values. The audit committee
	regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments.




	 




	The
	value of Group assets and liabilities at carrying and fair value is given below:




	 



Click to enlarge

	 




	For
	all other liabilities, the book value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value




	 




	Significant
	valuation issues if any, are reported to the Group’s Audit committee.



	 



	When
	measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized
	into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:




	 





	 


	●

	Level
	1:




	Quoted
	prices (Unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category includes active exchange traded equity
	securities, debt securities, derivatives and mutual funds.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	●
	Level 2:




	Inputs
	other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)
	or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes debt securities and preference shares.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●

	Level
	3:




	Inputs
	for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (Unobservable Inputs).

	(All amounts in Indian rupees unless otherwise stated)





	 




	If
	the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized in different levels of the fair value
	hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the
	lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.




	 




	When
	applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that
	asset or liability.

	Contingencies
	and lawsuits






	 





	The
	Group is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business. The resolution of these legal
	proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the
	Group. The contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for service tax matters amounts to INR 67,473,978 as at March 31,
	2016 and September 30, 2016.




	 




	The
	Parent Company and one of its subsidiaries had received a notice during the financial year 2014-15 from the Collector of Stamp
	(HQ) Delhi on account of verification of records pertaining to stamp duty on security transactions and on account of levy of stamp
	duty on commodity transactions. Matter is sub-judice and has been stayed by jurisdictional High Court at Delhi.




	 




	Pending
	completion of the legal process the impact of liability, if any, cannot be ascertained at this stage, however, management believes
	that, based on legal advice, the outcome of these contingencies will be favourable and that outflow of economic resources is not
	probable.

	Operating segments





	 




	The
	Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s Lines of Business (LoBs). The LoBs offer
	different products and services, and are managed separately because the nature of products and method used to distribute the services
	are different.




	 




	The
	following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:




	 




	1.
	Trading and distribution primarily comprises




	 





	 



	a.




	Brokerage
	on dealing in shares, commodities, derivatives and other securities on behalf of customers;





	 



	b.




	Proprietary
	trading in shares, commodities, derivatives and other securities;





	 



	c.




	Clearing
	services;





	 



	d.




	Depositary
	services rendered as depository participant;





	 



	e.




	Distribution
	of third party financial products and





	 



	f.




	Insurance
	broking services






	 




	2.
	Advisory services primarily comprises portfolio and wealth management, mortgage and loan advisory, real estate broking and investment
	banking services.




	 




	3.
	Financing services primarily comprises business of providing loans.




	 




	For
	these LoBs, the Group’s Leadership Team comprising of Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Group Chief Operating Officer and Group Chief
	Financial Officer, reviews internal management reports. Accordingly, the Leadership Team is construed to be the Chief Operating
	Decision Maker (CODM).




	 




	Segment
	profit before tax based on Indian GAAP is used to measure performance by the CODM. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm
	length basis. Information related to each reportable segment is as follows:

	34.
	Business combination





	 




	On
	July 26, 2016, the Group acquired investment advisory business of Franklin Financial Planning Inc., USA. (“Franklin”),
	a SEC registered investment advisory firm located in Deland, Florida. The Group has acquired Franklin because it expands both
	its existing investment advisory portfolio and customer base. The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method
	of accounting. The total purchase consideration for Franklin is INR 52,382,225(US $ 812,000), which includes the cash consideration
	of INR 30,119,151 (US $ 446,600) and equity consideration in form of shares of SMC Global USA Inc. (a subsidiary of the Parent
	Company) of INR 24,642,941 (US $ 365,400).




	 




	In
	connection with the transaction, the Group based on a provisional valuation recorded INR 13,083,554 (US $ 194,000) in customer-related
	intangibles, which has a weighted average amortization period of six years. The resultants goodwill arising from the acquisition
	amounted to INR 41,678,538 (US $ 618,000), which is primarily attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits from the
	acquisition. The goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.




	 




	Transaction
	costs of INR 700,000 have been expensed and are included in other expenses in the Statement of Profit or Loss and are part of
	operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows.

Inc. (OTC: SMCG) with a Price Target of $2.50AccesswireOctober 3, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / October 3, 2016 / SeeThruEquity, the leading independent equity research firm focused on smallcap and microcap public companies, today announced it has initiated coverage on Millennium Investment and Acquisition Co. Inc. (SMCG).The report is available here: SMCG Initiation Report.We initiate coverage of Millennium Investment and Acquisition Co. Inc. (OTC: SMCG, "Millennium") with a price target of $2.50 per share. Based in Old Bethpage, New York, Millennium is an intriguing special situation in the microcap space, which offers a combination of robust growth potential and a margin of safety from undervalued assets. Millennium has two key assets that appear to be steeply undervalued relative to its market capitalization. First, in 2015 the company purchased an active carbon ("AC") biomass plant located in Kawaihae, Hawaii. The plant was purchased out of bankruptcy in June 2015, at a significant discount to fair value (recently appraised at $13.9mn) and the original investment ($44mn). Millennium is in the process of upgrading the plant to produce high grade premium activated carbon. Premium grade, low ash / high purity activated carbon has the potential to be a high impact product line for Millennium, as it has much more favorable pricing characteristics than the standard activated carbon commodity, due to its use in advanced technologies in the energy storage, medical and information technology industries.Highlights from the report are as follows:Large market potential for activated carbonMillennium is in the process of upgrading the Kawaihae plant to produce high grade premium activated carbon. Premium grade, low ash / high purity activated carbon has the potential to be a high impact product line for Millennium, as it has much more favorable pricing characteristics than the standard-grade activated carbon commodity, due to its use in advanced technologies in the energy storage, medical and information technology industries. The plant has two years of macadamia nut shell inventory on site, and is located in proximity to key logistics including a macadamia nut manufacturing facility, industrial zones and a port with shipping capabilities. Millennium management believes the plant should be capable of producing activated carbon from 12,000 tons of macadamia nut shells each year, which would generate more than $5mn of EBITDA as it reaches commercial operations - before the impact of any byproduct revenues.Compelling valuationWe see Millennium as offering a compelling valuation, as each of the company's strategic assets appear to be worth more than the company's market capitalization. Millennium marked its 12% investment in SMC Global at $7.7mn, or $0.58 per SMC Global share. This compares to Millennium's recent market capitalization of $7.1mn - and we note that company has recently sold more than 600,000 shares at $1.22 in privately negotiated transactions with affiliates of SMC Global. As part of exploring an asset-backed debt financing, Millennium received an "as is" appraised value of the Kawaihae plant at more than $13mn. Including the company's cash on hand of $2.8mn at the end of 2Q16, and adjusting for liabilities, we estimate a sum-of-the-parts at valuation of $2.21 per share. We also note that Millennium's CEO, David Lesser, owns a 30% equity stake in the company, which should align his interests with those of shareholders.Initiate coverage with a price target of $2.50Our analysis of Millennium Investment and Acquisition Co. Inc. indicates a fair value estimate of $2.50 per share, implying an upside of 262% from the recent price of $0.69. The company offers an attractive combination of undervalued assets and potential for robust growth in the emerging market for premium grade activated carbon.Please review important disclosures at www.seethruequity.com.About Millennium Investment and Acquisition Co. Inc.Millennium Investment and Acquisition Co. Inc. (MIAC) is an internally managed and closed-end asset management firm focusing on investment opportunities in alternative energy. The Company currently holds a 12% stake in SMC Global, an Indian financial services firm.

SIGN UP FOR OUR 
GO PUBLIC REPORT
If you are considering going public please 
				email us for our free report. 



Tiber Creek Corporation specializes 
				in assisting companies in Going Public in the United States. Our 
				services include going public, private placement preparation, 
				investor relations and public-company reporting. 

               
				We take you public directly. You do not need a public shell to 
				go public.
The president of 
				Tiber Creek is a securities attorney with over 30 years 
				experience involving public offerings and the going public 
				process.


We assist companies in going public on the NYSE, 
				AMEX, NASDAQ, OTCBB (Over the Counter Bulletin Board) and the 
				OTC (over the counter) Pink Sheets. There are no asset or 
				revenue requirements to go public on the OTC Bulletin Board or 
				the Pink Sheets; so, even a start-up can go public.

				Once a company does go public, the business typically has these 
				advantages:
       
       •  Increase in valuation when you go 
				public
       •  Going public ads liquidity for 
				investors
       •  Raising capital is easier as a 
				public company
       •  A public company can use its stock 
				for a variety of purposes, including 
          trading it for 
				advertising to promote its products, services, and stock 
				

				
				In addition to financial professionals, you can offer your stock 
				to the general public. This is a distinct advantage that a 
				public company has in comparison to a private company. Please be 
				aware that you must follow certain guidelines, including 
				registering the offering with the SEC, before offering your 
				stock to the investing public.
Foreign 
				companies can also be publicly traded in the US

                 
					We also help foreign private companies to become publicly 
				traded in the US. For foreign public companies we can assist 
				with dual listings or ADR’s (American Depositary Receipts).
Going Public 
				Free Report and News

				receive our complementary reports or be kept up to date on going 
				public news please fill out our contact page.

				Counts

				are the recognized leader in taking small companies public.
