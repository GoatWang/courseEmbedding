Black Beauty™ Grass Seed
Black Beauty™ produces a darker-green turf naturally.  With improved disease resistance and drought tolerance, Black Beauty Grass redefines what a “green-lawn” is supposed to look like! The grass leaves possess an invisible waxy coating, very similar to what you’d find on an apple which helps to preserve moisture in the leaf and wards off stress from heat, cold, wind and disease. This blend grows well in clay or sandy soils and in full sun or partial shade, and will improve any lawn it is over-seeded into.
Key product features:
– Our most drought tolerant blend for sun & shade lawn areas
– Invisible waxy coating on leaves preserves moisture when hot
– Roots up to 4′ deep for superior drought tolerance
– Natural vibrant dark green color
– Grown by sod growers across the USA
– The original supreme grass seed blend that started it all!
 When to apply:
When the soil temperature reaches 55° (March-mid June or August-October)
How to apply:
Visit our Seeding Guide for complete directions.

Organics
We include organic fertilizers in our lawn fertilizer program because they feed the soil’s microbial population, and this in turn releases nutrients to the grass plants. It is a two-step feeding process. Synthetic sources of nitrogen largely bypass the life in the soil because they are water soluble and readily absorbed by lawn grass roots. The soil microbes are responsible for recycling organic wastes in the soil. They also are involved in complex relationships with the lawn grass plant, providing them with a better resistance to disease, fungus, insects and stress.

Organics and the New American Lawn Plan
In Jonathan Green’s New American Lawn Plan, both organic and synthetic fertilizers are used to encourage lawn grass growth. This balanced approach produces great results! Synthetic fertilizer works more quickly in cold, spring soil. Later in the year, after the soil has warmed to approximately 57 degrees Fahrenheit, organic fertilizers work very well.
Great New American Lawns result when genetically superior turf-grass varieties, like those in our Black Beauty Grass Seed Mixtures, are grown in healthy biologically active soil.
Growing your own great looking carefree New American Lawn is as Easy as remembering U-S-A
U – Use Black Beauty Grass Seed Mixtures
S –  Stimulate Soil Biology and relieve soil compaction with Love Your Soil
A – Adjust Soil pH Upwards rapidly with Mag-I-Cal

What about Weeds, Insects & Turf Disease?
Your best defense against the lawn pests is a healthy, thick lawn.
In reality, it is the control products – weeds, insects, fungus, etc. – that are the chief concern of people who want to use organic products exclusively on their lawns. Years ago, these concerns would have been more valid. However, the products currently available to control weeds, insects and fungus have a very low environmental impact. What’s more, in many instances it is the only effective means of control available. By following my New American Lawn Plan, you will be targeting your use of control products to where and when they may be needed.

Organic, Inorganic… Whats It All About?
The mineral and organic constituents of the soil, along with air and water, are inextricably intertwined.
In order to make satisfactory growth, grass plants must obtain from the soil adequate supplies of mineral elements. Of the twenty or more mineral elements which are present in the soil, some are essential for lawn grass growth such as potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, iron and magnesium. Nitrogen is an essential element, however, it is not derived from the minerals of the soil. The ultimate source of nitrogen is in the atmosphere, which consists of about 79% nitrogen gas, but exists in a form that plants cannot use.
Three processes are responsible for most of the nitrogen fixation in the biosphere.
1.      Biological fixation by microbes alone or in a symbiotic relationship with some green plants.
2.      Atmospheric fixation by lightning.
3.      Industrial fixation.
Elemental nitrogen is the same, however it is produced. Lawn grass plants make no distinction as to the source of the nitrogen. In the early 20th century, two German scientists, Haber and Bosch, developed a process for synthesizing nitrogen fertilizer from atmospheric nitrogen gas.
The soil forms a thin covering over much of the earth’s surface. 
It is a complex material consisting of minerals (derived from rock), water, gases and organic matter in various stages of decomposition.  In this complex mixture live an astonishing number and variety of organisms, mostly microscopic.  These organisms contribute to the soil’s formation, while using the soil as a habitat and source of energy.  These organisms are also recycling energy, nitrogen, to be used by green plants to promote their growth.  They are also capturing atmospheric nitrogen that is used by lawn grass plants.
By following the Organic Method of Lawn Care we work with nature in support of the natural processes described above.  When your lawn and soil are in harmony, a natural balance is achieved by which the lawn and soil are able to ward off most weeds, insects and diseases without you intervening with chemical control products.

WHAT IS THE NEW AMERICAN LAWN?

 

FEED YOUR LAWN
just feeding your lawn?


FEED YOUR SOIL
what about the other half?

Are you frustrated with your lawn year after year? Do you continually have weeds and bare spots that just don’t seem to go away? Have you been applying the same products and never getting the results you want? If this sounds familiar you should know that there is a better way to care for your lawn. It is a revolutionary concept in lawn care that Jonathan Green calls The New American Lawn Plan.
The New American Lawn Plan can change the way that you care for your lawn, for the better. It is based on the use of both organic and traditional fertilizers in the lawn when and where you need them. You will see that you do not need to apply turf chemicals all over the lawn year after year. You will finally take control of how you care for your lawn in order to grow an attractive, healthy lawn that will not be subject to most lawn problems.
Why should you integrate organics into your lawn feeding program? The benefits gained from the use of organic substances include improved disease and insect resistance and improved heat and cold tolerance. Organic products will also improve your lawn soil’s biology. The soil will become more permeable and alive, allowing water, air and grass roots to penetrate into the lawn soil more deeply and ultimately establishing a better foundation for grass to flourish.
Are you always fighting weeds, insects and fungus in your lawn? These problems are, in many cases, symptoms of poor lawn soil management. A healthy soil is the key to a healthy lawn. You can develop a healthy soil by feeding the microbes and earthworms in the soil with our organic lawn fertilizers. This approach is similar to the way we maintain our own health. When you have proper nutrition and exercise you rarely need medication. Give the lawn the proper soil environment and you will create your own healthy, attractive lawn that you can be proud of.
What type of grass seed have you been seeding your lawn with? If you have been using lower quality mixtures you will never achieve success. In order to achieve The New American Lawn you need to seed with genetically superior grass seed such as one of our Black Beauty mixtures. Remember your lawn will never be better than the grass seed you plant. Break the cycle of disappointment and failure this year and finally grow the lawn you deserve!

Most liquid shampoos don't lather nearly enough and get used up almost instantly, but the foaming nozzle on this bottle creates perfect suds (without SLS!). I'll buy this again and again.

Unfortunately this great smelling spearmint shampoo simply did not do a great job of cleansing my long mass of hair, even when I do a double foam up my scalp seems to get dirty and matted so much faster than with other SLS free shampoos.I bought this whole range and was rather unsatisfied with both the shampoo and conditioner but the leave in treatment was the stand out of the three items. continued >>       Report Abuse  1 of 1 people found this helpful.         				yyou				   on  6/1/2009 3:53:00 AM   More reviews by yyou    Age: 19-24 Skin: Sensitive, Fair-Medium, Not Sure Hair: Brunette, Other, Other Eyes: Brown     			This is a really great product, especially you have eczema-- it is Sodium Laureth Sulfate free but ALSO free of all the other SLS replacement additives they sneak in there (which other green lines are guilty of). The foaming head is a great solution to the fact the shampoo doesnt lather, there is no buildup no stickiness- which is scary if you aren't expecting it because we've been brainwashed to think that lots of foam=clean.

I read about the Green Rootine line in Oprah and decided to check it out.The shampoo is very interesting to say the least! It is a foam!! The foam did not lather up so I just distributed it throughout the hair and scalp and went through the motions. My hair and scalp felt clean after the rinse. I might have been a little heavy handed w/the pumps but I am used to a *little* lather! The scent is a pleasant peppermint/spearmint....almost like old school Doublemint gum after a serious long chew! My hair was left clean and soft...not greasy, limp, or tangly.I liked the all natural ingredients...no silicones/no sulfates!I used the conditioner w/this and received wonderful results from the blowout! The price is around $22 but that is what I normally pay for shampoo anyways! I will interchange this w/my new OJON shampoo.		     Report Abuse  1 of 1 people found this helpful.         				Meritorious				   on  7/27/2008 3:38:00 PM   More reviews by Meritorious    Age: 36-43 Skin: Combination, Fair, Not Sure Hair: Blond, Other, Other Eyes: Blue     			I love this shampoo. I took a real chance on it because Jonathan products have been hit or miss for me. But I'm trying to simplify and go basic with my beauty routine (rootine?) lately and this really fits the bill. It is synthetic-, paraben-, sulfate-, protein-, petrochemical- and silicone-free. That's quite an accomplishment and really the only shampoo I've seen that pure. The ingredients: Water, Saponified Cocos Nucifera (Coconut), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba), Olea Europaea (Olive) and Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oils, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Mentha Spicata (Spearmint) Oil, Citrus Sinensis (Orange) Peel Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract. It comes in a 5.1 oz. foaming pump bottle.I've been using this for three weeks (there's still plenty left in the bottle) and find myself using it every day even though I have Giovanni, Fekkai, Jane Carter Solution, and Aveda sitting right next to it. It does not seem to strip my hair which can be a little on the dry side in the summer. The scent of this is invigorating and fresh-- mostly minty. There are some secondary herbal scents but they blend very nicely. Great for the morning when I need a little jump start. The mint also makes me think that this is clarifying in some ways. I usually only need two pumps of product and my hair comes out squeaky clean just as the bottle promises.The foaming pump dispenser is a great idea. I have used plenty of styling products (hand washes, anti-bacterial foams, etc.) with the same mechanism that produces a light, airy foam. This is no different. Plus, it travels very well. I'm aware that this type of dispenser allows the manufacturer to use more water and less of the other ingredients but it also allows me to easily customize how much I use more than the usual pourable shampoos. And I appreciate that I can use the bottle over and over for other purposes. Perhaps Jonathan Product should consider adding to their line a concentrated refill for this shampoo that can be combined with purified water in the bottle for reuse. Eco-wise, that would be even better than the recyclable bottle.I purchased all three available Green Rootine products and this is the hands down winner for me (I will add reviews of the conditioner (I'll score it at 3 1/2 lippies) and the Silkening Creme (3)). Do I think this is overpriced ($20) for a shampoo? Yes. Will I continue to purchase it? Yes. It does everything I want a daily shampoo to accomplish with none of the side effects that usually make me rotate in a new product. And the purity of the product makes it a real winner for me.EDIT 6/21/09: Still using and loving this. When I'm not 'washing' with conditioner, this is what I use. Only.
