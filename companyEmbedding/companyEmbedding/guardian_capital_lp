                "A reliable, rock-solid pension manager, Guardian Capital and their risk managed approach is ideally suited to our Canadian bond mandate."
            
- Daniel Solomon, Chief Investment Officer, NEI Investments


Company Profile

                Guardian Capital LP was founded in 1962 and is one of Canada's oldest established, independent investment counseling firms. Its mission is to deliver superior risk-adjusted and value-added results through a disciplined and fundamental investment approach.
            

Investment Approach

                Our philosophy in managing fixed income portfolios is based on two fundamental beliefs: a) all decisions and strategies are based on the preservation of capital, b) The opportunities and risks within bond markets, rewards an active management approach.
                

                    In an effort to protect our clients' capital, Guardian focuses its research and the resulting portfolio on high quality issuers. The assessment of quality is based on internal credit analysis and a qualitative judgment based on their outlook. In addition to their emphasis on high quality, they approach the research process with a conservative mindset. This conservatism has meant that they do not rely solely on the credit rating agencies. While they review their opinions, they believe that it is important to complete first hand research of the security covenants, company fundamentals, industry forces and legislation, that might affect the holdings in the portfolio.
                    
                    Guardian believes market volatility allows for an active approach to bond management that can add value to portfolio results over the long run, while helping to reduce risks in the portfolio. Their philosophy towards active management is based on three principles: an approach that considers both capital gains and income in decision making, gradualism and the incremental capturing of gains.
