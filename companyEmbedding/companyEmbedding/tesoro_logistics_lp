DISCLOSURE; FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Information within this website contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other things, projections of revenues, earnings, earnings per share, capital expenditures or other financial items and discussions of estimated future revenue enhancements and cost savings. These statements also include the Company’s business strategy, goals and expectations concerning the Company’s market position, future operations, refining margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will” and similar terms and phrases identify forward-looking statements. Although management believes the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements contained in this site are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could be incorrect. All phases of the Company’s operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the Company’s control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect the Company’s results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. Actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors described in greater detail in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other of the Company’s filings with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing.

Tesoro Logistics Mulls Acquisitions
May 9 17
Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) is seeking acquisitions. Gregory J. Goff, Chairman of Tesoro Logistics, said, “First, we want to continue to have an appropriate cost of capital and yield, distribution growth and coverage that allows Tesoro Logistics to continue to grow, both through drop-downs as well as through organic growth and acquisition.”


Tesoro Logistics LP Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended of March 31, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017
May 8 17
Tesoro Logistics LP reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended of March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net earnings of $92 million, or $0.51 per diluted common limited partner unit compared to $85 million or $0.64 per diluted common limited partner unit a year ago. EBITDA was $210 million compared to $175 million last year. Net earnings and EBITDA for the first quarter 2017 include approximately $3 million of acquisition costs related to the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets acquisition, which closed on January 1, 2017. Net cash from operating activities was $207 million in the first quarter 2017 compared to $156 million in 2016. Net capital expenditures were $30 million, which include $20 million of growth capital and $10 million of net maintenance capital. Total revenues were $420 million compared to $300 million a year ago. Operating income was $150 million compared to $119 million a year ago. 


The company continues to expect total 2017 net capital expenditures of $295 million, including $230 million of growth capital and $65 million of net maintenance capital. However, total capital expenditures for 2017 could be lower given the timing of permit approvals for the Los Angeles refinery Interconnect Pipeline System project. The company continues to expect the assets to contribute $65 to $75 million of annual net earnings and $100 to $110 million of annual EBITDA in 2017.

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The Companies also unveiled new logos and ticker symbols."We are announcing a new name to reflect the Company`s ongoing transformation," said Greg Goff, Chairman, President and CEO. "The change to Andeavor acknowledges the significant progress we`ve made in becoming a premier refining, marketing and logistics company, and signals our aspiration to continue creating greater value for our stakeholders."Tesoro was founded in the 1960s as a company primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. It built and commenced operating its Kenai, Alaska, refinery in 1969 and began shifting its focus to refining and marketing in the late 1990s. Since 2010, through strategic growth, financial discipline, strong execution and the commitment of its employees, the Company has become one of the leading independent refining, marketing and logistics companies in the United States. Tesoro expects to close its acquisition of Western Refining (WNR) later today."While our name is changing, our strategic priorities, financial discipline, guiding principles and the foundational elements of how we operate remain the same," Goff said. "We will continue to focus on optimizing our highly integrated refining, marketing and logistics system, caring for the communities where we operate, aiming to achieve the best safety and environmental performance in the industry and investing in our people and assets."On Aug. 1, Andeavor common shares will begin trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ANDV, and Andeavor Logistics LP common units will begin trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ANDX. At that time, the TSO and TLLP ticker symbols will be retired.After Aug. 1, Andeavor will continue to license the Tesoro brand to retail stations that currently utilize it. The Company does not intend to make the Andeavor name part of its retail portfolio, which will include approximately 3,000 locations following the Western Refining acquisition.More information about the change to Andeavor and Andeavor Logistics LP is available at www.andeavor.com.ABOUT TESORO CORPORATIONTesoro Corporation, soon to be named Andeavor, is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products.
