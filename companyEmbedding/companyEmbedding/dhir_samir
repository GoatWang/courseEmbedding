Digital transformations shaped 2016. Enterprises centered their focus on business needs, capabilities and availability related to digital transformation. Major challenge was to maintain legacy IT services with limited budgets, while also increasing digital transformation within the business.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology is fast emerging as one of the biggest disruptive forces to drive benefits across multiple dimensions – cost savings, efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and compliance by automating key aspects of highly skilled knowledge work.

I believe a sea of opportunities and threats await the IT industry in the next 5-6 years. We are at a pivotal moment, a tipping point, if you will; as a new set of emerging delivery models become mainstream, already the anticipation on services like web platforms, SaaS (software as a service) and others have

Thomas Edison is best known for inventing the electric bulb; but he was also aware that the invention was of little use to people if there was no system to generate, transmit, and distribute electric power.

How to create value for businesses at a time when labour arbitrage in the outsourcing industry has plummeted? That is the challenge CIOs are facing today.

 One comment 



 

The term millennials is a misnomer. The general tendency to think of millennials as teenagers is flawed as millennials were born after 1980. The majority of millennial customers with purchasing power have exploded and brought to the market an entirely new set of expectations. With their dependence on social media to get and share information

The increased use of data analytics and business intelligence is one of the most popular paradigm shifts we have seen in the industry recently.

The last few years have seen tremendous changes in the business world; particularly the way customers, employees and partners are interacting and collaborating to conduct their business.

Ever wondered why so many application development projects have much longer than planned user acceptance testing phase? For a very long time developers focused on completing the functionality, with limited focus on usability. For the last few years, there has been a distinct trend towards a “consumerization” of IT.
