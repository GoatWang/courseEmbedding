History[edit]
In late 2011, Justin Lee, Jonathan Wasserstrum, and Aron Susman[3] formed the company and launched the first prototype in the spring of 2012[4] at VentureBeat's DEMO Conference in San Francisco. The first market for the company was in Houston, TX, where they initially raised $350,000[5] from friends and family.
In 2013, TheSquareFoot was chosen to be included in the 4th class Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator in New York, a startup incubator that offers seed funding and three months of mentorship for selected firms. By April 2013, TheSquareFoot had expanded Austin, Dallas, and New York City and TechCrunch named TheSquareFoot as one of the "Top 5 Startups to Watch".[6]
They closed another round of $500,000 from New York and Texas investors in the summer of 2013[7] to continue growth with Boston as one of the next markets in 2014.[8]
In April 2015, TheSquareFoot announced their first institutional financing round led by Primary Venture Partners, with participation from RRE Ventures, Triangle Peak Partners, and a slate of strategic angel investors.[9][10]
Product[edit]
TheSquareFoot launched a new version of their website in early 2014, including interactive pictures, videos, and floor plans of available spaces. The site also includes a Leasopedia, and a space calculator.[citation needed]

 Educational Background

Columbia University - Columbia Business School

                  Columbia Business School (CBS) is the business school of Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City.

It is one of six Ivy League business schools and its admission process is among the most selective of top business schools.

Emory maintains an uncommon balance for an institution of its standing: our scholars and experts generate more than $500 million in research funding annually, while also maintaining a traditional emphasis on teaching.
