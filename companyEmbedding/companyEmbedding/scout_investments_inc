History

For more than three decades, our investment teams have actively managed a distinct suite of equity and fixed income strategies by applying repeatable, proven processes steeped in rigorous research and analysis.
Scout has grown from our initial mutual fund offerings to becoming an institutional asset management firm with global distribution. Scout now offers mutual funds and separate account investment strategies for fixed income and equity investors.
The firm began as Scout Funds in 1982 as a division of UMB Bank, n.a. In 2001, the firm incorporated as Scout Investment Advisors, Inc. and registered as an investment advisor with the SEC. In 2009, the firm became an independent subsidiary of UMB Financial Corporation (UMBF). In 2010, the firm was renamed Scout Investments, Inc. and, in the same year, acquired Reams Asset Management (Reams). The acquisition of Reams has allowed Scout to expand the firm’s fixed income solutions.
Today, our equity management teams in Kansas City, Missouri employ distinct investment processes in search of companies with quality attributes including prudent management, strong fundamentals and growth catalysts. The firm’s fixed income team in Columbus, Indiana and Brookfield, Wisconsin conducts stringent credit, sector and bond market analysis while responding to quality investment opportunities generated from valuation discrepancies and market volatility.
The firm’s thoughtful approach to asset management extends to how we cultivate long-term client relationships and to how we distribute our strategies via separate accounts, commingled funds, mutual funds and UCITS products. Consultants, plan sponsors, institutional investors and intermediaries rely on our client development and distribution teams for portfolio commentaries, data analysis and investment process reviews they need to make informed decisions
All of Scout’s associates are committed to proactively providing the products, performance and resources that help our clients achieve their investment objectives.

Risk considerations:  Stock fund values fluctuate and investors
may lose principal value. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks are more
susceptible to market volatility due to risks such as  lack of
management experience, product diversification, financial resources,
competitive strength and liquidity. Real Estate Investment Trusts
(REITS) may be affected by economic conditions including credit risk,
interest rate risk and other factors that affect property values, rents
or occupancies of real estate.

Certain funds invest in highly leveraged companies, which tend to be
more sensitive to issuer, political, market and economic developments,
especially during economic downturns or periods of rising interest
rates. Groups of stocks, such as value and growth, go in and out of
favor, which may cause certain funds to underperform other equity funds.

Foreign investments present additional risk due to currency
fluctuations, economic and political factors, government regulations,
differences in accounting standards, and other factors. Investments in
emerging markets involve even greater risks. Focusing on particular
countries, regions, industries, sectors or types of investments may
cause greater risk of adverse developments in certain funds.

The return of principal in a fixed income fund is not guaranteed. Fixed
income funds have the same issuer, interest rate, inflation and credit
risks that are associated with underlying fixed income securities owned
by the fund. Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities are subject to
prepayment risk and the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or
other assets. High yield securities involve greater risk than investment
grade securities and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions
and credit risk. An unconstrained investment approach can create
considerable exposure to certain types of securities, such as
derivatives, that present significant volatility, particularly over
short periods of time. 

Derivatives, such as options, futures contracts, currency forwards or
swap agreements, may involve greater risks than if the Fund invested in
the referenced obligation directly. Derivatives are subject to risks,
such as market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk
and management risk. Derivative investments could lose more than the
principal amount invested. Certain funds may use derivative for hedging
purposes or as part of the fund's investment strategy.
The use of leverage, derivatives and short sales could accelerate losses
to the Fund. These losses could exceed the original amount invested.

Certain funds may, at times, experience higher-than-average portfolio
turnover, which may generate significant taxable gains and increased
trading expenses, which, in turn, may lower the fund’s return.

The Lipper Fund awards are calculated for periods over 36, 60 and 120 months. The highest Lipper Leader for Consistent Return (Effective Return) value within each eligible classification determines the fund classification winner over 3-, 5- or 10-years. 81 Mid-Cap Core Funds were eligible for this award for the 10-year period ending November 30, 2016. For more detailed information about Lipper’s methodology, please click here. The Fund may have experienced negative performance during one or more of the time periods represented by the Lipper award.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Unconstrained risk considerations: The Fund employs an unconstrained investment approach, which creates considerable exposure to certain types of securities that present significant volatility in the Fund’s performance, particularly over short periods of time. The return of principal in a fixed income fund is not guaranteed. Fixed income funds have the same interest rate, inflation, issuer, maturity and credit risks that are associated with underlying fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Foreign investments present additional risks due to currency fluctuations, economic and political factors, government regulations, differences in accounting standards and other factors.  Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities are subject to prepayment risk and the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or other assets. High yield securities involve greater risk than investment grade securities and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions and credit risk. Investments in emerging markets involve even greater risks.

Derivatives such as options, futures contracts, currency forwards or swap agreements may involve greater risks than if the Fund invested in the referenced obligation directly. Derivatives are subject to risks such as market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk,  credit risk and management risk. Derivative investments could lose more than the principal amount invested. The Fund may use derivatives for hedging purposes or as part of its investment strategy. The use of leverage, derivatives and short sales could accelerate losses to the Fund. These losses could exceed the amount originally invested.

The Fund may, at times, experience higher-than-average portfolio turnover, which may generate significant taxable gains and increased trading expenses, which, in turn, may lower the Fund’s return.

History

For more than three decades, our investment teams have actively managed a distinct suite of equity and fixed income strategies by applying repeatable, proven processes steeped in rigorous research and analysis.
Scout has grown from our initial mutual fund offerings to becoming an institutional asset management firm with global distribution. Scout now offers mutual funds and separate account investment strategies for fixed income and equity investors.
The firm began as Scout Funds in 1982 as a division of UMB Bank, n.a. In 2001, the firm incorporated as Scout Investment Advisors, Inc. and registered as an investment advisor with the SEC. In 2009, the firm became an independent subsidiary of UMB Financial Corporation (UMBF). In 2010, the firm was renamed Scout Investments, Inc. and, in the same year, acquired Reams Asset Management (Reams). The acquisition of Reams has allowed Scout to expand the firm’s fixed income solutions.
Today, our equity management teams in Kansas City, Missouri employ distinct investment processes in search of companies with quality attributes including prudent management, strong fundamentals and growth catalysts. The firm’s fixed income team in Columbus, Indiana and Brookfield, Wisconsin conducts stringent credit, sector and bond market analysis while responding to quality investment opportunities generated from valuation discrepancies and market volatility.
The firm’s thoughtful approach to asset management extends to how we cultivate long-term client relationships and to how we distribute our strategies via separate accounts, commingled funds, mutual funds and UCITS products. Consultants, plan sponsors, institutional investors and intermediaries rely on our client development and distribution teams for portfolio commentaries, data analysis and investment process reviews they need to make informed decisions

Scout Investments Launches Equity Opportunity Fund






Business Wire




Jun 17, 2014 9:30 AM EDT













 




























































  Scout Investments, Inc. (Scout) recently launched its Scout Equity Opportunity Fund (SEOFX). The no-load, all-cap Scout Equity Opportunity Fund is benchmarked to the Russell 3000 ® Index and seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies that are uniquely levered. These companies represent a corporate capitalization structure that enables maximum shareholder return through the optimal balance of debt and equity.  “We believe superior risk-adjusted relative performance can be achieved through long-term ownership of a diversified portfolio of levered stocks,” said Brent Olson, lead portfolio manager for the Fund. “Through the use of fixed income valuation metrics, we approach investing from a defined perspective that allows us to identify companies that we believe are undervalued and thus attractive for investors.”  The Fund invests in companies with stable or growing free cash flow, in the process of balance sheet improvement or growth, that demonstrate a meaningful desire to improve their leverage profile or move to an optimal debt level.  “We recognize debt metrics as a leading indicator for equity performance and use this as the basis for our disciplined investment process,” Olson said. “Through analysis of trends in the broader fixed income markets, as well as debt metrics, such as cash flow, leverage and earnings, we identify companies that we believe provide opportunity for future growth and profitability.”  “The Scout Equity Opportunity Fund is an exciting addition to our industry-leading investment product suite that strives to deliver relative outperformance over full market cycles,” said Andy Iseman, chief executive officer of Scout Investments. “We are pleased to provide a distinct investment solution led by a tenured manager and supported by Scout’s domestic equity research team.”   About Scout Investments   Scout Investments, Inc., a global asset manager headquartered in Kansas City, Mo., manages more than $32 billion in equity and fixed income investment strategies for institutions and individual investors. Scout is the investment subsidiary of UMB Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: UMBF). Please visit scoutinv.com for more information on our firm and our products.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   The Fund’s Prospectus or Summary Prospectus, available by calling 800.996.2862 or visiting scoutfunds.com, include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other important information. Please read and consider carefully before investing.   Equity Opportunity risk considerations: Small and mid cap stocks are more susceptible to market volatility due to risks such as lack of management experience, product diversification, financial resources, competitive strength, and liquidity. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) may be affected by economic conditions including credit risk, interest rate risk and other factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of real estate. Foreign investments present additional risks due to currency fluctuations, economic and political factors, government regulations, differences in accounting standards and other factors. Highly leveraged companies tend to be more sensitive to issuer, political, market and economic developments especially during economic downturns or periods of rising interest rates. Although the Fund invests in companies that may be highly leveraged, the fund itself does not use leverage as an investment strategy. Groups of stocks, such as value and growth, go in and out of favor which may cause certain funds to underperform other equity funds.  The return of principal in a fixed income fund is not guaranteed. When interest rates go up the value of bonds go down. Fixed income funds have the same issuer, interest rate, inflation, maturity and credit risks that are associated with underlying fixed income securities owned by the Fund. High yield securities involve greater risk than investment grade securities.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.

Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.

Advertising Practices

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.
