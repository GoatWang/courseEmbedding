Sell Discipline

	Edgewood’s philosophy is to act as a long-term and deliberate investor. Therefore, Edgewood's portfolio typically has moderate turnover and long holding periods.

	We adhere to a strict sell discipline in which primary coverage of a company is reassigned from the original Portfolio Manager to another member of the Investment Committee when one of the following events occurs:




		A stock is down relative to industry peers

		Two consecutive quarters of earnings disappointments

		A major change in the company or industry fundamentals


	Once one of these events occurs, coverage is reassigned and the stock is reassessed. The original analyst stays on the committee as an information resource but does not have a vote on the outcome.

	The committee in such cases discusses the new analyst’s findings and decides whether we should take advantage of the decline by instituting one of three actions:


		Buy more,

		Sell what we have, or

		Just hold on to what we have.




Evaluate
If one or more of the following:

Stock down relative to industry peers
2 consecutive quarters of earning disappointment
Major change in Company or Industry Fundamentals


 

Reassign & Reassess
Then:

Buy,
Sell or
Hold

Idea Generation

	Edgewood makes an investment only after conducting thorough research and analysis. We implement the rule of “Would we buy the entire company if we could?”  The Investment Team’s process begins by identifying companies that we consider to have financial strength, high levels of profitability, strong management, and the possibility to consistently deliver long-term earnings power. Because Edgewood typically purchases significant share amounts, we gain access to management and get to know well the companies in which we invest.

	The team searches for companies that are considered, according to our investment methodology, as well positioned for long-term growth driven by the demand for their products and services, trading at substantial discounts to their fair market value, and are at an early stage in their potential profit cycle.

Portfolio




	Edgewood's Large Cap Growth strategy pursues long-term appreciation driven by investment in a concentrated group of U.S. growth stocks which Edgewood considers to be of a high quality.

	Edgewood utilizes a multi-factor investment process designed to identify opportunities not fully reflected in market valuations. A combination of internally generated proprietary research and a refinement of externally sourced information are used to determine those companies that display:


		Record of consistent earning power

		Earnings growth rate in excess of the S&P 500

		Dominant market position or proven strength

		Attractive fundamental financial valuation

		Superior management

		Management/Insider ownership

		Industry growth rate in excess of GDP growth


	Based on the conviction gained through our comprehensive, proprietary analysis, we take significant positions in securities that we believe represent our best ideas, and we hold them for the long-term, dynamically trading them within a range of 2%-8% weighted positions when warranted.  Our largest positions often represent our largest discounts to present value with the biggest upside potential.  We are extremely valuation sensitive and typically have a three to five year holding period.

About Us




“As independent owners, Edgewood's partners are free to make unbiased decisions. For example, we generate our own investment research, so we are not beholden to outside influences. ”
- Alan Breed,President & Portfolio Manager




	Since its founding in 1974 Edgewood Management has continued to grow its assets and client base while maintaining the same customer service dedicated to the original high net worth clients.  We manage approximately $20.8 billion (as of 6.30.2017) on behalf of: individuals, family groups and institutions, including endowments, foundations, and pension plans.

	What Makes Edgewood So Unique?

Focus

	Edgewood’s strategy is quite unique, as we manage a 22-stock portfolio.  The portfolio weightings range between 2% and 8% where the largest weightings represent the most attractively valued companies or the companies with the biggest potential upside based on the Investment Committee's calculation. This portfolio construction discipline forces Edgewood to highlight growth and ensures that a high level of scrutiny is paid to all companies in which we are considering an investment. 

Experience

	Each one of the six Portfolio Managers has over 30 years of investment experience. Edgewood has been able to grow the institutional side of the business while maintaining the original values of the successful family-wealth side of the business.

Motivation

	Each of the Portfolio Managers has assets invested in Edgewood's Large Cap Growth strategy which creates a high level of alignment of interest with our clients. We strive to provide the highest level of service to our clients and build lasting relationships.

Cohesiveness

	Rather than relying on one CIO, Edgewood employs a strong and coordinated team approach for all investment decisions by leveraging our six portfolio managers and five analysts. The current Investment Committee has been together since 2006. Edgewood maintains the utmost commitment to excellence and holds everyone in the firm to high standards. There is an unmistakable and infectious passion, energy, camaraderie, and respect among all employees.

	Why Edgewood?

	Edgewood also believes its people are the key competitive advantage. The highly-qualified and cohesive investment management professionals are dedicated to building portfolios with the equities of companies that possess fundamentally strong market positions in growing industries, exceptional earnings power and consistency of earnings performance, which aims to result in superior market results over economic cycles.

	About Edgewood's Logo

 Our logo highlights the unified approach we take to our investments and the strong collaboration that occurs between our nine partners and our full team. The mark, made up of 22 lines representing the companies in which we invest, is pointed upwards to demonstrate our commitment to upward growth. The orange and brown symbolize our determination to succeed and the trust in our intelligence both internally and with our clients.
