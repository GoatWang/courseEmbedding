Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

 
As previously reported, on May 5, 2016,
CHC Group Ltd. (the “Company”), and certain of its subsidiaries, affiliates and related parties (together with the
Company, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”), seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy
Code”).
 
On October 20, 2016, the Debtors filed
their monthly operating report for the month ended September 31, 2016 (the “September Monthly Operating Report”) with
the Bankruptcy Court. The September Monthly Operating Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On November 18, 2016, the Debtors filed
their monthly operating report for the month ended October 31, 2016 (the “October Monthly Operating Report” and together
with the September Monthly Operating Report, the “Monthly Operating Reports”) with the Bankruptcy Court. The October
Monthly Operating Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
This current report (including the exhibits
hereto or any information included therein) shall not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required
to be disclosed solely by reason of Regulation FD.
 
Limitation on Incorporation by Reference
 
The information contained in this Item
7.01 shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated
by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether
made before or after the date hereof and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings, except to the extent
expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Cautionary Statement Regarding Financial
and Operating Data
 
The Company cautions investors and potential
investors not to place undue reliance upon the information contained in the Monthly Operating Reports, which was not prepared for
the purpose of providing the basis for an investment decision relating to any of the securities of the Company. The Company cannot
predict what the ultimate value of any of its securities may be and it remains too early to determine whether holders of any such
securities will receive any distribution in the Debtors’ reorganization. In particular, in most cases under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code, holders of equity securities receive little or no recovery of value from their investment. The Monthly Operating
Reports are limited in scope, cover a limited time period and have been prepared solely for the purpose of complying with the monthly
reporting requirements of the Bankruptcy Court. The Monthly Operating Reports were not audited or reviewed by independent accountants,
are in a format prescribed by applicable bankruptcy laws and regulations and are subject to future adjustment and reconciliation.
Therefore, the Monthly Operating Reports do not necessarily contain all information required in filings pursuant to the Exchange
Act, or may present such information differently from such requirements. There can be no assurance that, from the perspective of
an investor or potential investor in the Debtors’ securities, the Monthly Operating Reports are complete. The Monthly Operating
Reports also contain information for periods which are shorter or otherwise different from those required in the Company’s
reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, and such information might not be indicative of the Company’s financial condition or
operating results for the period that would be reflected in the Company’s financial statements or in its reports pursuant
to the Exchange Act. Results set forth in the Monthly Operating Reports should not be viewed as indicative of future results.
 

 
 

 
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements
 
This Form 8-K, accompanying exhibit(s),
and other statements that we may make, contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not
historical facts and include statements about our expectations for the timing and execution of our restructuring plan, our future
financial condition and future business plans and expectations, the effect of, and our expectations with respect to, the operation
of our business, adequacy of financial resources and commitments and operating expectations during the pendency of our court proceedings.
Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management, but are subject to risks
and uncertainties, which could cause actual results and/or the timing of events to differ materially from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements, including, among others: we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
and are subject to risks and uncertainties; operating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies;
our employees face considerable uncertainty due to the Chapter 11 proceedings; we may suffer from a protracted restructuring; our
ability to emerge from Chapter 11 and operate profitably thereafter will depend on increasing our revenue, lowering our costs,
and obtaining sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully; we have substantial liquidity needs and, due to our
current Chapter 11 proceedings, may not be able to obtain any equity or debt financings in the capital market for the foreseeable
future; we may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 proceedings; our restructuring efforts through
the Chapter 11 proceedings may be expensive, take resources and distract management; we are in the process of rejecting and abandoning
a significant portion of our helicopter fleet through the Chapter 11 proceedings, which may result in an inability to quickly respond
to new opportunities and a significant loss of market share and profit margins; our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, our independent registered public accounting firm has raised substantial
doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we have not included any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty; we have a history of net losses; our substantial level of indebtedness, operating lease commitments, purchase
and other commitments could materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under our debt agreements, our ability
to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs; all flights with the aircraft
type H225 and AS332 L2 have been temporarily grounded which may cause a material and adverse impact to our financial viability;
operating helicopters involves a degree of inherent risk and we are exposed to the risk of losses from safety incidents; if we
are unable to mitigate potential losses through a robust safety management and insurance coverage program, our financial condition
would be jeopardized in the event of a safety or other hazardous incident; failure to maintain standards of acceptable safety performance
could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and could adversely impact our reputation, operations
and financial performance; our operations are largely dependent upon the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry;
the oil and gas industries on which we are largely dependent are suffering through a severe downturn, resulting in significant
negative impact on demand for our services, and no assurance can be given that the downturn will not continue to be prolonged;
many of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we are unable to effectively compete, it may result in a
loss of market share or a decrease in revenue or profit margins; we rely on a limited number of large offshore helicopter support
contracts with a limited number of customers. If any of these are terminated early or not renewed, our revenues could decline;
negative publicity may adversely impact us; our fixed operating expenses and long-term contracts with customers could adversely
affect our business under certain circumstances; we depend on a small number of helicopter manufacturers and any safety issues
can severely limit our ability to continue operating helicopters already in our fleet; we depend on a limited number of third-party
suppliers for helicopter parts and subcontract services; restructuring of our operations and organizational structure may lead
to significant costs; our business requires substantial capital expenditures, lease and working capital financing, which we are
currently blocked from accessing through the capital markets and banks. Any further deterioration of current industry or business
conditions, the capital and banking markets or a prolonged period in Chapter 11 proceedings generally could adversely impact our
business, financial condition and results of operations; we rely on the secondary used helicopter market to dispose of our older
helicopters and parts due to our ongoing fleet modernization efforts; our operations are subject to extensive regulations which
could increase our costs and adversely affect us; our MRO business, Heli-One, could suffer if licenses issued by OEMs and/or governmental
authorities are not renewed or we cannot obtain additional licenses; we derive significant revenue from non-wholly owned variable
interest entities. If we are unable to maintain good relations with the other owners of such non-wholly owned entities, our business,
financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected; our operations may suffer due to political, regulatory,
commercial and economic uncertainty; our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments
increases the compliance risks associated with our international activities; we are subject to extensive federal, state, local
and foreign environmental, health and safety laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that could have an adverse impact on our business;
we are subject to many different forms of taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the world, which could lead to disagreements
with tax authorities regarding the application of tax laws; the offshore helicopter services industry is cyclical; we are exposed
to foreign currency risks; our failure to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates effectively could unfavorably
affect our financial performance; we are exposed to credit risks; our customers may seek to shift risk to us; if oil and gas companies
undertake cost reduction methods, there may be an adverse effect on our business; reductions in spending on helicopter services
by government agencies could lead to modifications of SAR and EMS contract terms or delays in receiving payments, which could adversely
impact our business, financial condition and results of operations; failure to develop or implement new technologies and disruption
to our systems could affect our results of operations; we rely on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against
service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and
our business could be negatively affected; the loss of key personnel could affect our growth and future success; labor problems
could adversely affect us; if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans’ obligations,
we could be required to make substantial cash contributions and our liquidity could be adversely affected; adverse results of legal
proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations; in the event we are
or become treated as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our U.S. shareholders
could be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences; we are controlled by a shareholder group, which might have interests
that conflict with ours or the interests of our other shareholders; due to our Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, our ordinary
shares may have no value and any investment in our shares is highly speculative; the market for our ordinary shares historically
has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations; we have not paid dividends on our ordinary shares historically and may
not pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares or preferred shares for the foreseeable future; pursuant to the terms of the
preferred shares, which rank senior to our ordinary shares, we are required to pay regular cash dividends or issue shares in respect
of amounts accrued as dividends on the preferred shares, and we may be required under certain circumstances to repurchase the preferred
shares; we are currently unable to pay such obligations while we are in Chapter 11 proceedings and are likely not to pay any cash
dividends for the foreseeable future; our preferred shares have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are
preferential to the rights of, holders of our ordinary shares. Such preferential rights could adversely affect our liquidity and
financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our preferred shares differing from those of the holders
of our ordinary shares; we are a holding company and, accordingly, are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate
the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends; the requirements of being a public company may strain
our resources and distract our management; provisions of our articles of association and Cayman Islands corporate law may discourage
or prevent an acquisition of us which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares; our organizational documents contain
a variety of anti-takeover provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control; shareholder rights under Cayman Islands
law may differ materially from shareholder rights in the United States, which could adversely affect the ability of us and our
shareholders to protect our and their interests; as a shareholder, you might have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment
against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands; and our Major Investors, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice
and First Reserve Management, L.P. may compete with us, and our articles of association contain a provision that expressly permits
our non-employee directors to compete with us; and other risks
and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended April 30, 2016. The Company’s filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission are available at www.sec.gov. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking
statements herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are qualified in their
entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
No assurances can be given that our efforts to effectively reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code will ultimately be
successful or that we will succeed in strengthening our balance sheet or increase our financial flexibility. Should one or more
of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially
from those indicated.

No. 16-31887] (collectively, the “Debtors”). On May 5, 2016, each of the Debtors filed a voluntary petition with the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas for reorganization relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the
United States Code. The cases were consolidated for procedural purposes only under Case No. 16-31854. • The Debtors use a
centralized cash management system. See the Cash Management motion and orders filed on May 5, May 7, June 9, July 8, August 9,
September 2, September 23, October 21, and November 11, 2016, and Docket Nos. 11, 59, 288, 569, 733, 832, 903, 1044, and 1144
for a full description of the Debtors’ cash management system. • For financial reporting purposes, the Debtors generally
prepare consolidated financial statements. On May 31, 2016, Schedules of Assets and Liabilities and the Statement of Financial
Affairs (“Schedules and Statements”) were filed for CHC Cayman Investments I Ltd. Separate Schedules and Statements
were filed for each of the remaining Debtors on July 5, 2016. On October 7, 2016, Debtors CHC Group Ltd. and Heli-One Canada ULC
filed amended Schedules of Assets and Liability at Docket Nos. 936 and 937, respectively. Each Debtor’s Schedules and Statements
were prepared using the assets and liabilities of that Debtor pursuant to the Debtor’s accounting records. For purposes
of this monthly operating report, however, the financial statements are presented as consolidated. • The Monthly Operating
Report (“MOR”) is not meant to be relied upon as a complete description of the Debtors, their businesses or condition
(financial or otherwise), or their results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities. The Debtors reserve all rights to
revise this MOR. This MOR is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This MOR should
be read in conjunction with the previously filed financial statements and accompanying notes in the Company’s annual and
quarterly reports that are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain exceptions as listed below
are not exhaustive of all non-GAAP compliance: • The financial statements are unaudited and will not be subject to audit
or review by the Debtor’s external auditors at any time in the future and are subject to change. • The MOR does not
reflect all normal quarterly adjustments that are generally recorded by the Debtor upon review of major accounts period to the
end of each quarterly accounting period. • Certain items presented in this MOR are under research and may be accounted for
differently in future monthly reports. In particular, the accounting for potential lease rejection claims in accordance with ASC
852. • The MOR does not include explanatory footnotes such as disclosures required under GAAP. • The MOR is not presented
in GAAP-based SEC reporting format. • Pursuant to corporate governance requirements in foreign jurisdictions, certain Debtors
have appointed employees as statutory directors. These employees do not receive any supplemental payments on account of such appointment,
including director fees. Accordingly, payments to these employees are not included within the scope of MOR 6, payments to insiders.
• The Debtors secured a $200 million bond over their holdings with Bank of America, and a $20 million bond over their holdings
with HSBC, representing the significant majority of the cash in the Debtors’ cash management system. The covered accounts
include all of the accounts held by Cayman Investment I Ltd., the Debtors’ central banking entity. The requirements of section
345(b) of the Bankruptcy Code have been waived with respect to all Bank Accounts not held at Bank of America, N.A. or HSBC Bank
Canada (see Docket No. 832 and 903). Case 16-31854 (Jointly Administered) 2

CHC
Group Ltd., et al. Monthly Operating Report Case Number: 16-31854 (jointly
administered) ACCRUAL BASIS-1 (3 of 3) Balance Sheet Support OCTOBER 31, 2016 Explanatory notes on certain balance sheet items:
(1) The Debtors enter into long-term revenue agreements, which provide for pricing denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency of the parties to the contract. This pricing feature was determined to be an embedded derivative which has been bifurcated
for valuation and accounting purposes as required under US GAAP. (2) At the inception of an operating lease the Debtors may provide
a loan to the lessor as part of the helicopter lease arrangement, with the recovery of the loan dependent on the helicopter residual
value at the end of the lease term. (3) Helicopter deposits relate to payments made to original equipment manufacturers for the
acquisition of new aircraft. (4) Security deposits are amounts paid in connection with lease agreements and are refundable at
the end of the lease term. (5) Deferred financing costs include the direct costs of arranging lease financing, which are deferred
and amortized straight-line over the term of the lease, and deferred financing costs on debt obligations. (6) Prepaid helicopter
rentals relate to advance payments made under operating leases. (7) At the inception of an operating lease where the Debtors have
guaranteed a portion of the helicopter residual values at the end of the lease term, a liability is recognized with a corresponding
prepaid rent asset that represents the fair value of the guaranteed helicopter residual. The prepaid rent asset is amortized on
a straight-line basis to net loss over the lease term of the related asset and the liability is derecognized at the end of the
lease term through settlement or on expiration of the guarantee. (8) The Debtors recognize a liability for contractual termination
benefits when the liability is both probable and estimable in accordance with ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits.
The Debtors recognize a liability at fair value for one-off termination costs associated with an exit or disposal activity in
accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. The Debtors recognize a liability for excess helicopter operating
lease obligations when the Debtors cease using the helicopter permanently in operations. The liability is measured at fair value
based on the remaining lease rentals including any contractually required costs including maintenance, adjusted for the effects
of any prepaid or deferred items recognized under the lease. This liability is further reduced by estimated sublease rentals that
could be reasonably obtained for the helicopter even if the Debtors do not intend to enter to a sublease. (9) At the inception
of an operating lease where the Debtors have guaranteed a portion of the helicopter residual values at the end of the lease term,
a liability is recognized with a corresponding prepaid rent asset that represents the fair value of the guaranteed helicopter
residual. The prepaid rent asset is amortized on a straight-line basis to net loss over the lease term of the related asset and
the liability is derecognized at the end of the lease term through settlement or on expiration of the guarantee. On an ongoing
basis an assessment is performed to determine the portion of the residual value guarantees that the Debtors will be liable for
and to ensure the appropriate liability has been recorded. (10) Pre-petition intercompany payables are denominated in several
non-USD currencies and have been revalued at the period end rate. (11) The Debtors may enter into lease transactions whereby the
Debtors may sell an owned asset and then lease back that asset. Deferred gains on sale and lease back transactions are amortized
over the lease term excepting amounts relating to unresolved lease guarantees. (12) The Debtors maintain defined benefit pension
plans. The cost of defined benefit plans is determined based on independent annual actuarial valuations performed using the projected
benefit method prorated on services and management’s estimate of expected plan asset performance, salary escalation and
various other factors including expected health care costs, mortality rates, terminations and retirement ages. The funded status
of defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans is recognized on the balance sheet. (13) Lease asset
and liability balances for rejected leases which have been approved by the court have been charged to reorganization items. Case
