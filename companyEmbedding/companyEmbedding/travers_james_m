us from selling and marketing directly via email for privacy concerns” (James M. Travers, 2016). 
- “[We] have to be mindful of local labor laws, both from the hiring and firing perspective.  It is very 
difficult to let people go in mainland Europe… it’s expensive and time consuming” (James M. 
Travers, 2016).

- “There will be some specific product feature[s] that need to be added, like time keeping, again, given
labor laws changes” (James M. Travers, 2016).

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FleetMatics First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now turn the conference call over to our host, Mr. Brian Norris. Please go ahead, sir.
Brian Norris - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Tuwanda. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the call. I'm joined here today by Jim Travers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jill Ward, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Lifshatz, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our press release announcing our first quarter results and our business outlook as well as a reconciliation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the most comparable GAAP measures is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you will also find a summary of key financial and operating statistics for the last five quarters.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. We recommend that you consider those risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. A description of these risk factors can be found in today's press release as well as in our periodic filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements made today represent our views as of May 4, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update them to reflect future events or circumstances.
During the call, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation, expense and the amortization of intangible assets as well as certain other non-recurring items. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing our performance. A reconciliation of these GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's press release.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me briefly bring to your attention a few upcoming investor events. We, once again, have a very active IR calendar coming up here this quarter. We'll be at six conferences including the Jefferies Technology Conference in Miami on May 11, the JPMorgan Technology Conference in Boston on May 23, Stifel Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 6, the Baird Technology Conference in New York on June 8, the Citi SMID Cap Conference on June 9 and the William Blair Growth Conference in New York on June 16. To learn more about IR outreach plans, please feel free to contact either Jenna or myself.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On today's call, I will share an update on the company's succession planning, a summary of our Q1 results and some thoughts into the key trends we are seeing in the business. I will then turn it over to Jill to review some highlights on the product development front, and Steve will provide a deeper dive into our numbers and outlook for the balance of 2016.
I want to start with an update on our succession planning activities. As we announced earlier today, after 10 years at the helm, I've decided to step down as CEO, effective January 1, 2017. Our board of directors has approved the succession and transition plan, whereby Jill Ward, who currently serves as our President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of CEO eight months from now.
For the company, its customers, employees and shareholders, this is absolutely the right decision and the right person. Jill is eminently qualified to lead the company in its second decade of growth. Jill joined us from Intuit and has been responsible for leading all of our operating functions including global sales and marketing, product strategy and development, customer support, operations, human resources and IT. Her leadership and operating experience within rapidly growing multi product software companies make her well qualified to be our next CEO. I will remain Chairman of the board, and I will continue to be actively involved in various strategic initiatives of the company.
Jill, on behalf of the board of directors, I congratulate you, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with you throughout this period and for a seamless transition at year's end.
With that let me turn to the highlights from the quarter, which was a success by every meaningful measure. Our strong results position us well to execute on our strategic growth plans.
Revenue was $78.9 million, up 21% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.3 million, up 15% year-over-year. Free cash flow margin expanded to 17% compared to 11% in the year ago period. We ended the quarter with 737,000 vehicles under subscription, up 28,000 sequentially. And finally, we ended the quarter with 37,000 customers, up 2,000 sequentially.
We achieved solid growth across our key customer group's NGOs. We continue to extend our technology leadership and remain well positioned to extend wallet share and drive ARPU higher over time with several new applications. We continue to transform our market leadership into improved financial results for our shareholders.
Now let me turn to some commentary on our target markets. We saw sequential and year-over-year growth in both the lower end of the SMB market, a sub-75 vehicle fleets and the larger part of the SMB market, the 75 vehicle to 500 vehicle fleets, which we commonly refer to as mid-market. In the sub-75 vehicle fleets specifically, Europe turned in its strongest quarter ever with robust growth on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Certainly, the results here were aided by our recent entry into Italy. But even without the effect of the Visirun acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2015, Europe still delivered record subscriber growth in the sub-75 vehicle fleet market.
In the larger part of the SMB market, which we commonly refer to as the mid-market, we added 34 new customers in the first quarter compared to 24 new customers in Q4, and 30 in the first quarter of 2015. The growth, both in terms of subscription and revenue, was strongest in the U.S. and in Australia. And I'd say, we're generally pleased with what we are seeing in this part of the customer base. We continue to capture market share with innovative marketing programs and sales campaigns designed to grow share in this part of the market.

Finally, in the enterprise business, which we define as fleets of over 500 vehicles, we secured two new customers in the first quarter. The first win was TNT Crane & Rigging, one of the largest crane service providers in North America with over 1,500 employees. TNT delivers lifting solutions safely and efficiently to customers across a diverse set of industries including oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, power and commercial end markets.
This initial roll out for approximately 600 vehicle subscriptions include our LED or electronic log offering, our driving-style application and our fuel card integration. The second enterprise win was An Post, the Irish National Postal Service which collects, processes and delivers more than 2.5 million items of mail to more than 2 million addresses using a road fleet of over 2,700 vehicles. Under the terms of our initial four-year deal with An Post, we will be supporting over 900 vehicle subscriptions with REVEAL+, our driving-style application, our fuel card integration and our driver ID feature. We expect this to be a land and expand opportunity down the road.
We also inked (7:51) several follow-on enterprise expansions in Q1, including a nearly 1,000 subscription follow-on order from a leading Fortune 100 company. While the timing of mid-market and enterprise wins and activations remains challenging to predict, we are encouraged with our progress here and believe this continues to validate the competitive differentiation of our offering.
Let me shift gears and share a little insight into what we are seeing in the key geographies where we compete. We continue to execute well on our goal of expanding internationally. In terms of the financial impact, I'm pleased to report that our international operations contributed 13% to revenues in the first quarter compared to 9% in the year ago period, and 10% all of last year. Thoroughly strategy to drive growth through international expansion is beginning to deliver strong results.
We saw particularly strong performance across our European markets. Ireland, aided by the win in An Post, which I mentioned a moment ago, and the Netherlands were both very solid performers in Q1. While it's still early, we are pleased with the progress we are making in Italy and France, two countries that we entered in 2015 through acquisition.
We continue to see evidence of accelerating sales growth when we combine local expertise with the FleetMatics sales model. We continue to believe that we have a great opportunity to grow throughout Mainland Europe. In France, we are clearing benefiting from the flywheel effect one year after our entry into that market and are opportunistic that the same dynamic will play out in Italy.
Bottom line, we had our best quarter ever in Europe, both organically on a fully reported basis post the Visirun acquisition. It's early days with our post acquisition integration with Visirun, but we are on plan with all critical actions.
Moving around the globe, we continue to be very pleased with our performance in Australia, which delivered record greater than 40% growth year-over-year, and all of that was in the sub 500 vehicle fleet market. Rounding things out, Mexico was solid in Q1 and we continue to see steady progress there.
Before I turn things over to Jill, just a brief update on our pilot agreement with General Motors. As discussed previously, we believe that in the future OEMs will become an increasingly important player in the fleet management ecosystem. As OEMs equip more vehicles with telematics hardware, the capital cost associated with acquiring and installing an in-vehicle device in these pre-equipped vehicles will be eliminated.
I am pleased to report that we've successfully completed the initial tactical integration work between the REVEAL platform and the GM OnStar hardware. And we have begun the initial phase of the work necessary to put a commercial contract in place. It's still early, but certainly another encouraging step in this opportunity, so stay tuned with that.

So, in summary, we are pleased with our execution and results in the quarter, which continue to demonstrate the leverage of our business model to generate profit and cash. We continue to see good momentum with our key growth initiatives, and we are encouraged by the strong start, which, we believe, positions us well to execute on our strategic growth plans.
With that, I'll turn things over to Jill for her thoughts. Jill?
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer

First, with regard to our update on succession planning, I wanted to share that I'm excited by the opportunity to take on the role of CEO as we move into our next stage of growth. And I'm thrilled by both the tremendous global opportunity we have in front of us, and the product and platform strategy we have in place to achieve it. I appreciate Jim's support along with the confidence of the board of directors. And Jim, it's my pleasure to work with you every day.
With that, I want to briefly highlight some of the innovative work we're doing in three application areas; WORK, Routist and Logbook. As you know, an important part of our overall growth strategy is expanding wallet share by delivering more value through additional applications to customers. Building from our platform strategy, we are able to deliver additional applications that target and solve critical business challenges that are found in nearly every service-oriented business.
All of these applications are still pretty early. The WORK is farthest along, but together will help us drive increased customer stickiness and over time our ARPU expansion. WORK, of course, is our mobile field service management application, which enables businesses and fieldworkers to streamline and accelerate many of the manual processes that you find in service delivery businesses.
I'm delighted to report that WORK continues to gain momentum with revenue up 18% sequentially in Q1 and up 164% year-over-year. The growth continues to be driven by strong new customer and subscriber adoption. The demand for WORK continues to strengthen as well, and we continue to see firm pricing for the application and stable contract terms. Further, we continue to see strong customer validation of the combined WORK and REVEAL value proposition.
Let me turn next to our newest application, Routist, an application available exclusively to FleetMatics' REVEAL customers, which provides measurable savings in both time and expense by quickly and efficiently optimizing daily routes.
Routist will be generally available in June. And priced at approximately $15 per month per vehicle and sold through our existing sales force in Chicago. What we've been pleasantly surprised by from our beta customers is that the impact Routist has on decreasing the time spent planning daily routes is much more substantial than we originally thought, and is incremental to the already significant ROI related to lower driver payroll and reduced fuel costs tied to route optimization. We believe that about up to 25% of our existing base over time could be a good fit for this application as we expand the features and functionality of the application.
Another opportunity for the business is the recently passed mandate for Electronic Logging Devices or ELD. Our Logbook offering enables our customers to meet critical regulatory compliance requirements as a transition from the labor-intensive world of tracking hours of service with pen and paper to a highly efficient cloud-based solution. Our mobile app approach also makes it easy to stay current with changing regulations on a platform that drivers already understand.
Our Logbook offering, which we estimate, is applicable to up to 20% of our subscriber base is another great example of our broadening platform play and our ability to drive wallet share and ARPU.

So, with that, let me turn it to Steve for insights on our financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year. Steve?
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Well, thanks, Jill, and good afternoon, everyone. And today, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter and our outlook for the balance of the year. And starting with the first quarter; total revenue was $78.9 million, up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting strong new customer additions and strong performance from our international operations.
Approximately 13% of our revenues came from outside of North America, reflective of the traction we've seen throughout Europe and Australia along with the success we've had with our recent acquisitions. Net additions to fleet management vehicles under subscription grew 4% sequentially and 24% year-over-year to approximately 737,000, that's up 28,000 subscribers sequentially.
Our gross churn rate was 2.85% in the first quarter compared to 2.42% in the fourth quarter. Now excluding oil and gas customers, our gross churn would have been essentially flat on a sequential basis with Q4.
As we shared with your on our last call, we continue to track customer behaviors very carefully, particularly in the oil and gas industry. We continue to expect that gross churn will remain at this level through Q2, will reduce slightly for Q3 and will return to our normal annualized range by Q4. I think it's important to point out that in many cases we may lose a subscriber, but we keep the customer.
Now, gross margin, on a non-GAAP basis, was 74.5% compared to 74.6% in the same period last year, primarily reflecting the continued impact of 2G-3G conversions and our continued investments in resources ahead of the curve for our WORK product as well as some of the impact from recent acquisitions that are not yet fully converted to the FleetMatics infrastructure, a process that can take six months to 18 months. And we're in great shape to complete the 2G-3G upgrade cycle as we plan by the end of this year.
Now, sales and marketing expense, on a non-GAAP basis, was $25.9 million, an increase of 22% over the prior-year period reflecting the full cauterized (16:35) impact of the Visirun acquisition as well as overall growth in head count to build out our North American and international sales forces along with the investments we continue to make in our customer experience and our WORK sales teams.
We tend to receive a number of questions on our cash CAC or cost per subscription acquired. I want to remind investors of a couple of things. First, there was limited enterprise accounts this quarter, which tend to defray the cost per subscription. And second, we continue to invest heavily in our international sales efforts, particularly in our newer geographies, which tend to distort the numbers. And just for context, despite enterprise accounts during the quarter, our North American cash CAC decreased both sequentially and year-over-year.
Now, R&D expense, on a non-GAAP basis, was $5.6 million, an increase of 43% over the prior-year period, reflecting again the full cauterized impact of the Visirun acquisition as well as head count additions to support our new application offerings including WORK, Routist and Logbook.
And for clarity, we capitalized $1.5 million of R&D expense during the quarter versus $900,000 during Q1 of 2015, reflecting the incremental product activities both the functionality and a geographical perspective, which are underway.
G&A expense, on a non-GAAP basis, was $12.3 million in the first quarter, an increase of 28% over the year-ago period. A majority of this increase was due to head count additions related to the acquisitions of Ornicar and Visirun, and the increase in bad debt expense related to our growing customer base.

We exited the first quarter with approximately 1,225 employees compared to approximately 1,150 employees at December 31, 2015. Our operating income, on a non-GAAP basis, was $15 million in the first quarter compared to $14.2 million during the first quarter of last year.
Earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, was $0.35 compared to $0.33 per share in the year ago period. Earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, was $0.14 compared to $0.30 per share in the year ago period. The foreign currency amount on the face of the income statement arises from the exchange rate fluctuations when revaluing certain assets and liabilities denominating currencies other than the respective functional currently of each entity.
The effective GAAP tax rate was a negative 111.4% in the first quarter compared to 11.8% in the year ago period, both inclusive of discrete items. As we mentioned on our last call, the tax benefit in the first quarter was primarily driven by the release of Irish UTPs.
The first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $24.3 million, up 15% compared to $21.2 million for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8% in the first quarter compared to 32.4% in the first quarter of last year. And as a reminder, our adjusted EBITDA margin tends to ramp throughout the year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $186 million in cash compared to $177 million at December 31, 2015 and $172 million in the year ago period. We generated $23.5 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter. We invested $9.8 million between property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software, resulting in free cash flow of $13.7 million or 17% of revenue.
Now, total deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter was $29.9 million compared to $30.3 million at the end of Q4. And as a reminder, deferred revenue is comprised of a combination of contracts being paid for, but not yet fully installed, as well as customer prepayments.
Now, on that point, we're seeing fewer customers engage in prepaid contracts as we virtually eliminated any economic incentive for them to do so. I expect this to show up in declining deferred revenue balance over time. Deferred revenue will vary quarter-to-quarter, and is not a meaningful predictor of future revenues.
And we ended the quarter with a net accounts receivable balance of $20.7 million compared to $21 million at December 31, 2015. So, DSOs for the quarter were 23 days, same as last quarter.
And I'll close with a few comments as to how we're thinking about the year. In summary, we're pleased tonight to be reaffirming our previously-issued guidance for 2016. We expect 2016 revenues to range from $342 million to $346 million. We expected adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $113 million to $117 million in 2016.
We expect full-year non-GAAP EPS to range between $1.72 to $1.80, and are modeling the full-year weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 40.5 million. And from a taxation perspective, we've previously shared that our 2016 affective tax rate will be approximately 12%, but our expected tax rate after UTPs should be in the 6% to 7% range on a GAAP basis and negligible for cash purposes.
And for the second quarter, we're targeting total revenue of $82.5 million to $84 million. And we're targeting adjusted EBITDA of $26 million to $27 million, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be range between $0.39 to $0.41 based on approximately 39.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
So, in summary, we're pleased with our strong first quarter results. We continue to differentiate ourselves in the market in terms of top line growth, EBITDA margins and free cash flow from operations. The business remains strong with a lot of excitement about our growing European penetration, momentum in our mid-market activities and expanding enterprise pipeline. And we continue to invest in the business where we see opportunity and remain excited about our longer term prospects.

And with that, let me turn the call back over to Brian.
Brian Norris - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Steve. Tuwanda, at this time, we'd like to open the call up for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session

And one moment please for our first question. Our first question will come from the line of Saket Kalia. Please go ahead with Barclays Capital.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here, and congratulations to you both, Jim and Jill.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
Thank you.
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Saket.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, let's just start with the GM relationship or progress in that relationship, I should say. Realizing that it's early, can you just talk about whether GM is going to continue to sort of have that open system approach when it comes to telematics? And what if you heard other OEMs sort of leaning towards sort of a close garden or more of an open approach like maybe some OEMs are taking?
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
This is Jim, Saket. I would say that at this stage GM is still looking at it as being more than open platform, but their thinking is still developing based on as they put their overall telematic strategy together. So, I think, they will definitely open it up, but they will have a select set of providers much like us. We will not be, it's not an exclusive arrangement. So, I think their thinking is much more, at this stage at least, more towards open.
It's too early for me to comment on the others in terms of how they're thinking about things. So, I would just say with that one I would say, time will tell on how that ends up moving. We have our opinion, what we think is the right way, be thinking about that, but obviously the decision is theirs.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And then for my follow-up for Steve. Steve, just one clarification. It sounded like we should be lowering our non-GAAP tax rate. And correct me if I'm wrong there, but the related question would be, why wouldn't EPS be going up then if we should be thinking about a lower tax rate for 2016?
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Well, this is consistent with the guidance that we provided last quarter. We had this big release of UTPs during Q1. We've got some additional UTPs that will be released during the course of the year. So, I don't think there is any change to what we've previously guided as far as overall tax rate. And of course, as you're adjusting out for your adjusted earnings, there is a slight add-back component associated with the UTPs.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. That's it for me guys. Thanks very much.
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Saket.

And our next question will come from the line Tom Roderick with Stifel. Please go ahead sir.
Matthew VanVliet - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Hi. Matt VanVliet on for Tom. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously a lot of improvement here on the international markets, and you talked about continuing to invest there. Where should we think about kind of hitting that run rate and getting to scale in those businesses through where we shouldn't see a whole lot of incremental sales and marketing investments moving forward?
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. This is Steve. As I mentioned on the call, it takes somewhere between six months and 18 months depending upon the particular operation to really get the business operating with the full FleetMatics infrastructure. So, if you think back about what happened with some of the geos that we did little over a year ago, Australia, Holland and the like. That order of magnitude nine months to 12 months. We think that if you take a look at France, that's progressing extremely well just because of the way that we're operating Italy that maybe on the longer end of where we see things. But we're very excited about what we've seen in the opportunity that the different geos have brought to us, and I think it's investment worthwhile.

Matthew VanVliet - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
And then looking at some of the newer products, how much revenue do you think we should start thinking about those contributing whether it's, as we exit 2016, or kind of, I guess, maybe what the run rate we could expect from both WORK and Routist near the end of the year?
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
So, for the really new offerings, particularly, Routist, we shouldn't assume anything, really anything material for 2016. WORK as well, well, it's ahead of Routist. It is in its early days as well. We don't break that out specifically, but I think that as we mentioned earlier, the momentum on top line for WORK is quite good. We're up 18% sequentially and 164% year-over-year, and that's probably a good top line momentum, is a good metric to watch there.
Matthew VanVliet - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Right. Great. Thank you.
Brian Norris - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Matt. Next question please, Tuwanda?
Operator
Next question will come from the line of Kenneth Wong with Citi. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Wong - Citi Investment Research
Hey, guys. I guess my first question on the CEO transition. As we think to Jill hiring last year, was the succession plan bear in mind, when you guys hired for that particular role. And then as Jill transitions to more of the CEO duties, should we expect that you guys are going to try to backfill that COO role that she is currently in?
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Let me add to that. This is Jim. Well, first of all, yes, this has been a very thoughtful planning process with the board. So, as we looked at adding a new executive officer a year ago, as we did with Jill, we were thinking about that in context of succession planning. So absolutely that was an important part of our hiring process. And obviously, Jill has got a great background as you know.
So, secondly, in terms of the transition that the CEO (29:12) with another role, look, it's way too early to discuss that. As you might imagine, we feel very good about the senior team that's in place. So I would reference the fact that we recently hired a new SVP of Global Sales, which we're excited about adding to our team. Before that, we hired a new VP of Engineering, John Molamphy from Dell. So, we've been strengthening the management team all along here over the last, call it, 10 months to 12 months. So I think that will evolve naturally. And I think, as Jill gets into the seat, and we see how things evolve, then obviously we'll do the right thing for the business at that time.
Kenneth Wong - Citi Investment Research
Got it. That's perfect. And then, Steve, in terms of the churn, I'm just trying to get a sense of what gives you confidence that that bottoms out in Q2. Is it just (30:03) as you look to oil and energy, when the bulk if you remove might be coming up or is it something else that you're seeing in the fundamental that give you confidence that we'll start to see that improve in Q3 and beyond.
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. One of the things that we shared last quarter, of course, was that we saw this large volume of activities both in Q1 and Q2, and then, to a lesser extent, in Q3 coming up. And because we can actually see the movement on those vehicles, we had some pretty reasonably insight as to what might happen with those customers as the renewals came up. So, I think we had some pretty good foreshadowing of Q1.
In fact, if you take out oil and gas, we're virtually flat with Q4. We would expect to see very similar metrics on Q2 as we saw in Q1, split in very similar manners because of the number of vehicles that are renewing for the different classes. And then in Q3, as our total basket of renewals actually reduces, I think that we start getting back towards the range and we would expect in Q4 with what we're seeing right now to be back in the range that we've previously seen.

Kenneth Wong - Citi Investment Research
Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Next question will come from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please go ahead sir.
Matthew C. Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to hit on the mid-market and the pick up that you saw there. Is there anything different that drove that in the quarter versus the fourth quarter where was a bit weaker than you'd seen throughout 2015?
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
So, I think the mid-market group, if you will, behaves in certain ways like enterprise. So, it's difficult to forecast exactly when something is going to close or nurturing the pipeline at all times as we go forward. We've got a pretty good pipeline in mid-market. So, it's really just a sense of natural fluctuation there.
Matthew C. Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just in terms of competition, you had mentioned on few of the prior calls that you'd seen a bit more aggression maybe in terms of contract terms and pricings from at least one competitor out there. So, maybe you could give us an update on that in terms of what you're seeing in the market?
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. There's really no change in the competitors or competitor tactics. At this point, no real change at all.
Matthew C. Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks, guys.

Our next question will come from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Brian Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations, Jill and Jim. So, I wanted to hit on the pricing maybe from a little bit of a different angle. And as you guys expand more internationally, will we see any pressure or volatility on that average revenue per vehicle figure?
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
This is Steve. Yeah. One of the things to keep in mind is that we do price in local currency. So, to the extent that the dollar strengthens, you do see some impact on that. Clearly, we saw some slight impact on that this past quarter. But I think overall, we're pretty pleased with the metrics that we see in Europe.
Now, keep in mind a couple of things. Not only is the pricing little bit lower, we also – and this is very specific to Visirun and to a much lesser extent with Ornicar with those acquisitions, some of the historical units that were acquired, and it was about 30,000 for Visirun and about 15,000 for Ornicar, had materially lower ARPU than we typically sell for. So that was diluting when you kind of look at the averages as well. But I think on a go forward basis, we would expect that our European ARPUs would kind of stabilize to our normal European rates and currency aside.
Brian Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Steve. And just a follow-up. On your energy customer base, I know you guys size that at 6% of total subs. But thinking about that versus your expectation maybe a quarter ago, did the churn there actually come in a little bit better than you expected for the earlier renewals in the first quarter or is it about consistent with what you were expecting? Thanks.
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
It's pretty consistent with what we were expecting. There is a little bit more art than science to this, because you tend to, in many cases, retain the customer and reduce some of their vehicles. And some times that customer retains a few more vehicles than you might plan for, and sometimes you got a customer that retains a few less than you might plan for. So, we ended up being pretty close to where we expected to end up.
Brian Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.

Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Thanks. I guess, just another follow-up there on oil and gas. It sounds like you haven't started seeing any sort of domino effects whereby weakness in oil and gas begins spreading to other parts of the country or other regions, or other segments that are maybe tangentially related. It seems like the churn issue is still pretty well contained in that one specific segment.
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
I would say, yes, at this stage. And from what we can see from activities, there's couple of specific geographies were you could probably stretch and suggest that. There might have been some of the base churn that was associated with oil and gas, but we keep a pretty close eye on it as I mentioned. We are tracking vehicle movements. We are tracking the activities. And we're not seeing anything at this stage that would suggest any unusual movements.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Okay. Very good. And then, I guess, just one other topic. You had mentioned last quarter and you mentioned again here in your prepared remarks, but there is, obviously, seasonality to your OpEx and to your EBITDA margins. Can you remind us just kind of qualitatively why we see that kind of frontend loading in OpEx and why margin should ramp through the year and your visibility on that topic?
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. And this is a cadence of the business that we've had for probably the full decade that we've been in business where we tend to do a lot of our hiring at the end of Q4, beginning of Q1 in concert with the plans that we're putting together for the business for the year. And since we have a pretty good cycle of what it takes between hiring, investing in marketing and then actually seeing that leverage come through in the model, it becomes a reasonably predicable capability for us. And you can look back over the last several years, we've had that similar cadence where margins are lower in Q1, of course, you reset all of your medical and whatnot, but you've also got these new heads in there which are not quite productive until probably late Q2.
This past quarter, you saw something a little bit unusual whereas we saw about a month of Visirun expenses in our Q4 2015 numbers, and, of course, that was three months in our Q1 of 2016 numbers. So that amped it up a little bit further. But most of this corresponds to our annual planning as our board approves our budgeting for the following year.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Okay. Very good. Thanks.

Our next question will come from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. Being about a year of move now from the Ornicar acquisition, what kind of success have you guys seen in upselling those existing subscribers? And what if anything can we read through that to the Visirun acquisition?
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, this is Jim. I'll let Jill comment on it. I think a couple things to note in, given Ornicar, and I think in our talking points here which is that we were confident as we looked at acquisitions both in France and in Italy, and if we look at other geos there that we could potentially accelerate the growth rate of those companies by the nature of, one, looking at having a product like Le REVEAL, which in the case of France, we're actively selling which is a better product.
And two, putting our sales DNA, which is the way we think about things, which is obviously web selling stratifying that fleet size and seeing some acceleration from that. And that is what we commented on that we have seen that certainly in Ornicar, and the ability for us to obviously add some cost in terms of sales and marketing. But more importantly, the way our blueprint works and seeing returns on that and we're starting to see that. It's early days in Visirun, but we're even seeing a little bit of it there as well, and we've obviously seen in Australia as we looked it from that geo perspective. So, additional comments, Jill, you might want to add there.

Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I would just say a couple of additional things. So, we're accelerating essentially penetration in those new markets for Italy and France. In terms of your comment on upselling that maybe a future opportunity of upselling other applications to them, that is not something we're tackling right now in Italy and France.
If the upselling referred to moving over Ornicar and Visirun customers on to the REVEAL platform, that's something we'll do over time. We don't force on day one customers to move over by platform. We're aggressively selling REVEAL in France. We're still selling Visirun in Italy. And those things will migrate over time.
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
But I would say, because again it's a very good question that you asked is that, we look at this as contained to acquire customer. So, if you went back to my initial comments, we added 2,000 new customers in the quarter to the company. And we are really pleased with that, because when it comes down to our playbook here, it's building the platform out. And over time, having the ability to upsell both WORK, Routist, now that's GA, and we will time phase that from a geo perspective because obviously you have to worry about the local changes you might have to do for that product. But the long-term plan for the company is acquiring customer and then upselling that customer over time. So, we feel pretty good about the opportunity we have in front of this to do exactly that not only in the U.S., North America, but also in Europe.
Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Thanks for the time. Congratulations again on the quarter.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer

Our next question will come from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC
Yes. Just following up on what you just said about adding sales. How do you strategically plan for adding WORK and Routist into Europe? In other words, is there a way for us to take a look at what is happening in the U.S. and then begin after a period of time to extrapolate that to Europe?
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
So, I do think that over time, the needs of small businesses in every market are quite similar. So, yes, we would for sure look at adding additional applications to our customers in more than simply the United States. So, the answer to that will be yes. Right away, no, as those applications are still new. We'll be testing them out and getting them up and rolling here largely in the U.S. We're already selling WORK a little bit outside the U.S., but we're early days on that. So, from that standpoint, I wouldn't expect much there in 2016 or even early 2017 as we get things really rolling on those new apps before we extend.
Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC
Thank you.
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And I think it's important – let me just add one because Jill hit a very important point, which is the problem that we're solving, right, for the customer is the same. So, in terms of transferability of the pain point of what we're seeing with a WORK customer in North America or in Australia, which is the two markets we're really focused on selling today is very similar to the same kind of challenges the service oriented business has in Europe and the geos we're in. That's the good news.
As Jill said, obviously, there's a lot of work we have to do to make sure as we enter those markets with WORK or with Routist, but that's the exciting part, because that's where the leverage is.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer

And we fully intend to do that, and very excited about that. Thank you for asking.
Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC
Thank you. And secondly, with regard to the 2G to 3G upgrade conversion, have you hit most of the, like, low-hanging fruits? In other words, as you move on through the process of transitioning customers, are you getting to hold out or harder to transition customers where customers that maybe more expensive toward the end of the entire group that you are transitioning.
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
This is Steve. I'd say that we're pretty much right on target where we expected to be at this point in the cycle. I think we have been progressing exceptionally well. We started this back in 2012. So, of the customers set that we plan on moving over during 2016, certainly there is a subset of them which are ones who have not wanted to take their vehicles off the road yet or do whatever is necessary. Having said that, we work very closely with them. And I wouldn't say that they're more expensive to accommodate. They're just a little bit slower in getting attention.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
And the only thing I would add there is, we have a very structured approach to it. We've learned a lot since last year on how to help customers through that process, and a great thing about a hard deadline is it's a hard deadline. So, even the folks who were terribly interested early on in making that transition, understand that they're going to need to do that. And we're quite good at working with some on how to help them do that. So, I think, we're moving along right on pace.
Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC
Okay, good. Because at some point, you're going to be going to 4G and 5G. I know you don't want to think about that right now. Okay. Thank you very much.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
Okay.

Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You called out the sequential and year-over-year decline in cash customer acquisition cost in North America. I wondered if you could just give a little more detail around some of the tailwinds that you're seeing there.
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think, one of the points I wanted to make is, if you look at our CAC and I'm looking it on a cash basis. So, it's a little bit more appropriate. But there is a few things that are going on here. Firstly, we're obviously still investing in many of the European geographies. And as Jim and Jill both pointed out, both Ornicar and Visirun acquisitions are obviously getting a lot of attention and we're seeing some nice successes there as a result of that. So that's skewing some of the numbers.
We continue to invest in what we're doing for both our WORK sales team and recall that that's a separate selling organization. And also for our internal customer experience team, which are the focus who deal with the renewals and making sure that the customers have a good life time experience with us. And that's more of a scale issue as the business grows that's just going to grow right along with that. But when you look at our North American team, which is a great proxy for how the business is going, that's the one I was pointing out that was actually down a little bit when you look at both sequential and year-on-year, and I think really speaks to the efficiencies that we're seeing in that business.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
That's great. And then, as you spend more time in the international markets, what are a few of the, kind of, major takeaways with respect to any market specific dynamics around competition or the customer value proposition? And how that relates back to your experiences in North America? And how you can use that to continue to penetrate those markets?

Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
So, I think we're struck by, first, by the similarities actually for small businesses, the similarity of need, similarity of pain and our ability to solve it. I would say that the marketplaces are generally fragmented and very local. And from that standpoint, there is a lot of opportunity for us as a leading provider with a global platform that works for small businesses everywhere.
There are time-specific capabilities that come when we acquire to – capabilities that came with the Visirun acquisition. For example that serve that local market. And so we take those on board and build those into our platform as well. So that's an opportunity for us. Generally, I think it is, again, the similarities that we're quite struck by. And I'm very excited by that opportunity in every one of those markets, fragmented, open, available to us, great stuff.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
Great. Thank you.

And our next question will come from David Gearhart with First Analysis. Please go ahead.
David Gearhart - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the time to take my call. First question for you is, can you provide an update on your efforts to go through a reseller in Chile?
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. This is Jim. We continue to experiment there. Obviously, it's very de minimis in terms of the impact to our overall business. So, I would say that we're continuing to learn how to support someone like that. And at this stage, it's not leading us to do anything more aggressive, but we're monitoring it. So, we'll keep you advised as we go if we decide to expand it.
David Gearhart - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. My next question is, historically FleetMatics hasn't really been focusing on taking sub-five vehicle fleets. Just wondering if your thoughts there might be changing, if you can give us an update on how you see that part of the market.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
So, we continue to see that we would stay focused on the market that we're in, the degree of need. We see that we serve is really a little bit higher than the sub-five. And until we see a real change there, we're always looking at that. We look at that for technology, capabilities, need factors that come from consumer and tiny business.
So we'll continue to look at it, but are very focused on our core market. And our average size, as you know, is in the teens when it comes to vehicles for a particular company. So, always watching it has not been a place where the need is strong enough that customers want to pay a lot when it's just a couple of vehicles, but always watching it for sure.
David Gearhart - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. My last question is, you haven't talked about monetizing your data assets in a while with analytics packages and whatnot. Just wondering if you're continuing to invest there, and if there is any update you can provide.
Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
Yes. We are continuing to invest there, and have added in recent months some data scientist to help us as we go through what our opportunities are to use that vast amount of data. We've got more than anybody else in North America. We've got data coming in from REVEAL as well as from WORK and will from other applications as well that we think is pertinent to have a customer runs their businesses and it's pertinent to potential partners as well. So for sure, we are hiring in that area. We have been hiring in that area, and continue to work, value for the customer and beyond. So, stay tuned on that, lot of work going on there.
David Gearhart - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.

Jill A. Ward - President & Chief Operating Officer
Thank you.

And our final question will come from Rajesh Ghai with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Siddhant Sharma - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Hey, guys. This is Siddhant here on behalf of Rajesh. Thanks for taking my questions. So, last quarter you mentioned that 6% of your subs were in the oil patch and your data suggested that 20% of vehicles are ideal in the oil patch. Can you update us on the renewal rates of the oil subs? How many of the 40,000 subs (51:24) remain in terms of renewals and what percentage of vehicles pertaining to those subs are running ideal?
Stephen J. Lifshatz - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. This is Steve. I don't think we identified any percentage that were sitting ideal. However, I think, we did share that we tend to watch that pretty closely. Suffice it to say ex the and gas specific subs Q1 looked very much like Q4 on a churn basis, and we'd expect to see that very similar in Q2 and we'd expect that to reduce a little bit in Q3. And I think by the time we get to Q4 2017 with what we're looking at today, we're back within our normal range.
Siddhant Sharma - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. Thank you. And can you give us any other updates on the progress of the auto OEM share (52:11)?
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
This is Jim. Again to emphasize my comments in the script, we have completed the technical feasibility pilot with GM that we'd announced previously. And what I noted was that we are now looking at discussing potential commercial arrangements with them, nothing yet formed or announced, but we're moving into that phase and I just said to stay tune with that.
Siddhant Sharma - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. Thanks.
James M. Travers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
So, with that, let us conclude the call here. And again, I just want to emphasize the fact that I'm very pleased to have Jill assuming the new role of CEO. We're going to work very closely together. I remain extraordinarily excited about the growth opportunities for the company. And again, I really look forward to continue to team with her as we continue that journey.
And again, I want to emphasize the fact we feel very good about the quarter, both our execution and our results relative to what's happening. And again, I always like to highlight the leverage of our model and the ability to generate cash in this business, which I'm sure most of our investors here understand. So, with that, thank you very much, and thank you for participating.
