Ironically, the splashing part of the gas turbine-powered vessel's debut is what is now causing headaches at the Miami, Fla.-based company.

Quick to offer a remedy is Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS), which was awarded the repair contract from Celebrity in August. The company, which brainstormed with Celebrity's executives on September 8 at Kingsmill's conference facilities in historic Williamsburg…

5.0 out of 5 starsThe perjury epidemicByG. Ware Cornell Jr.on April 19, 2011"If it wasn't for perjury I'd be out of business."That always gets some laughs when I say it to clients and to witnesses I am preparing for testimony. I am not encouraging them to lie under oath; quite the opposite. Instead I am telling them a fact of courtroom life-"there are going to be lies told, and you had better be prepared for them." I explain that the fact that people on the other side may lie, it does not allow lies on our side. My job, as a lawyer, is to ferret out those lies and expose them. Once a witness is revealed as a liar on a subject, the witnesses credibility on every subject is shot.James Stewart, as a journalist and as a lawyer, has seen this epidemic grow. When the rich and powerful like Bill Clinton, Barry Bonds, Bernie Madoff think nothing of rising their right hands, swearing to tell the truth, and lying through their teeth, something has gone terribly wrong. But although James Stewart's excellent book focuses on the lies of the power elite, the truth is that perjury is probably the single-most common crime in America today. And as Stewart notes, its not just the witnesses, lawyers are often the enablers, the messengers of deceit, spreading the word, "we need you to say X". And when X is really Y, that is perjury.So where does it stop? Hopefully the end begins now. Our nation cannot endure long if truth is simply a commodity, rather than a sacred flame that lights a democratic ideal.And in spite of the participation of some lawyers in this culture of deception, many of my colleagues before the bar agree with me. When I tell my joke, most don't crack a smile.Read this book and join the revolution.

Top critical reviewSee all 13 critical reviews› 3.0 out of 5 starsDisappointing.ByBenon October 19, 2016Stewart is a fine writer.  Generally, I find his books compelling but, in this case, I am disappointed in his selection of big lies.  Of the five represented, Libby, of Watergate infamy, is barely cogent; Bonds, just plain boring.  Martha Stewart was only sort of interesting.  Not his best, by a long shot.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsA first-rate story teller takes on the lying addiction of the rich and famousByF.  Rothon April 19, 2011Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseLying seems epidemic in American society. Stewart focuses his superb writing skills on the general problem of perjury and lying under oath by highlighting the cases of four celebrated liars: Martha Stewart (no apparent relation to the author), Scooter Libby, Barry Bonds, and Bernie Madoff. For each of these, he asks the same question: "Why would people with so much to lose put so much at risk by lying under oath?" Ultimately, the answer becomes obvious: "They thought they could get away with it."Stewart uses extensive sources for his own narration. Chief among these are notes from investigations, court proceedings, and personal interviews. Although the book is non-fiction, it's a page-turner, because the machinations of the perpetrators and their victims are suspenseful, ensnaring, and powerfully emotional. Each of the perpetrators would ultimately explain their deceits as motivated by "loyalty," but this seems mostly self-serving and devious. Whatever loyalty they had in mind was to themselves, as all were readily prepared to let underlings and associates take hard falls to cushion their own.  In the end, most of the celebrity liars recovered reasonably, with the exception of Madoff who will be in prison for a long time and has lost the love of his family and seen one of his sons commit suicide pursuant to the shame he showered on them.These continuing losses of Madoff as well as those of Bonds, recently convicted of obstruction of justice, aren't covered in the book which was written in 2010 although published in 2011.This book has several strengths, and perhaps just one weakness. The strengths are the readable and interesting writing, about larger-than-life "heroes" turned "villains." As he points out, these villains "evidently expect to be admired for this behavior." Meticulously researched and artfully written, the book provides considerable details, easily read and enjoyed. It also addresses a central problem "lying under oath [that] undermines civilization itself."If the book has a weakness, it would be its failure to look at the bigger picture in order to frame the problem more usefully, to bring it perhaps closer to an appropriate remedy. The bigger problem, in my opinion, is that lying is rampant throughout all of society, not just at the level of criminal investigations and judicial proceedings. While it's true that celebrities routinely lie to protect their wealth and status, the problem seems far more extensive. We have in the US a system rigged for the rich and powerful, whether individuals or corporations, that rewards lying as "business as usual." Why is that? Two reasons, primarily: (1) lying pays and (2) liars are not punished. That might sound hard to believe, if you've not actually investigated it. However, there are few laws against lying, they are usually not enforced, and in many cases--such as politics--the Supreme Court protects liars. The Court has ruled that politicians can routinely lie and broadcasters must be willing (if they are not already eager) to sell to the liars and their campaign organizations advertising time to carry those lies to as many people as they can possibly infect.So, when Stewart suggests that fixing this problem "requires a capacity for moral outrage," he's right, but as a remedy that prescription falls far short. To bring the epidemic under control, we are going to need to invent and employ new solutions. For example, Snopes on the Web publicizes some lies ("urban myths") and many people check Snopes before they pass lies along. PolitiFact and FactCheck, two other Web sites, investigate political lies and policy lies. New products such as Wolfram Alpha, StateOfTheUSA, and numerous regional indicators projects aim to provide curated and reliable answers to important questions. Wikipedia enables many people to edit and polish statements, hopefully bringing them rapidly to a state of truth. A new organization, TruthSeal.org, offers means for people and organizations to affix seals of truth to their vetted claims and to offer bounties for people to present falsifying evidence. In these and other ways, we might create stronger incentives for truth telling and stimulate social networks of people to ferret out lies in the public information commons. By changing the incentives, rewarding truth tellers and punishing liars, we could hope to begin to change the course of this rampant social disease.Without some change to the rules of the game, we should continue to expect the same outcomes, over and over.In fairness to Stewart, he wanted to tell a compelling story and get people thinking seriously about how our society encourages obviously sociopathic behavior. He does that extremely well. Another book will be required to look at the bigger, more general problem, consider the situation from a problem-solving point of view, and lay out the best courses of action for implementing remedies. Readers who might be interested in my own study of that problem and proposed recovery plan should consider TRUTHINESS FEVER: How Lies and Propaganda are Poisoning Us and a Ten-Step Program for Recovery.1010 comments|

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsMaster UntanglerByMiddle-aged Professoron May 14, 2011Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseNo one is better than James Stewart as a financial feature reporter.  He gets to the bottom of a complex series of events and explains them with unsurpassed clarity and objectivity.  If you are interested in the subject he's describing, there is no better source for learning about it.  And those skills are on display in the four lying-related scandals he discusses here:  Martha Stewart, Scooter Libby, Barry Bonds (and other BALCO defendants) and Bernie Madoff.  In each story, Stewart's focus is on the lies the subject told to official investigators, and since such lying is much closer to the heart of the Stewart and Libby scandals than to the Bonds and Madoff events (for the latter two, official lies were more of an interesting sidelight than the core of what will put them in the history books), I found those portions of the book the most interesting and enlightening.  Indeed, for Martha Stewart and Scooter Libbey, Tangled Webs should stand as the definitive treatment.  Read this, and you'll "get it."  In opening and concluding sections, the author ties the four stories together by shucking his customary objectivity for a jeremiade against perjury and official lying.  He has passionate feelings on the subject that no doubt were part of the source of his energy that allowed him to so meticulously record these events.  While I am more than sympathetic to his views on this point---in my case he is preaching to the choir---I did not find those parts of the book particularly persuasive; they are not the reason to buy it.  This may be in part because of the very excellence---the irrefutable, closely documented objectivity---of the main body of the book.  This is one book where reading just the first and last chapters is the exact opposite of what you should do.0Comment|

This was a great dissection of these cases that explains the details of what happened in a way that makes the media circus hash of these complex tales comprehensible.  THe detail is tremendous and I can only imagine the hours and hours of research that went into this book.  I am very impressed and feel enlightened. Great, great book.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent.ByJ. Terryon April 19, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseYes, I bought it twice.  So good am passing  it along to others.Here is what I said in my first review: This book is compelling, and excellent read.  He takes 4 case studies, and breaks down the events.  Martha Stewart, Barry Bonds, Libby Scooter, and Bernie Madoff.  Fascinating turn of events.  I also thought Martha Stewart was an innocent "victim" of sorts, but no longer!  And Bernie Madoll - how did the government screw that one up so badly?  Barry Bonds and cohorts, what a disappointing discovery to see how tainted the athletics system is.  Amazing read.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

That's not the fault of the author, and perhaps all the more reason I should read that chapter. I also have heard so much about Bernie Madoff that I am uncertain whether to read that chapter either. But I read the first two and thoroughly enjoyed and was enlightened by them. Is it fair for me to give a review to a book that I have only half read, and not decided whether to finish? I have decided yes because the first two chapters on Scooter Libby and Martha Stewart were alone good enough to give the book five stars.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsFour Complicated Stories Made EasyByAEPon June 24, 2011Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase"Tangled Webs" is the story of four very complicated recent cases:1. Martha Stewart and the insider trading scandal;2. Scooter Libby and the Valerie Plame, CIA outing;3. Barry Bonds and steroid use in professional sports;and4. Bernie Madoff and his ponizi scheme.All four of these stories have been exhaustively covered in newspapers, magazines, on-line stories, and in television over long periods of time, which made them complicated because these venues presented pieces of the story at any given time.  When I first learned of the publication of this book, I hesitated to buy it because I am wary of most people's ability to tell a complicated story in an easy to understand fashion but I was keenly interested in the subject matter and I had faith that the author could do it based on his past writings.  The purchase was well worth it.  Mr. Stewart presented each story in an easy to understand way by taking all the pieces (people, testimony, e-mails, letters, television shows, stories, etc.) and presenting them in chronological order that no newspaper or magazine writer or television producer has been able to do.  His research is exhaustive and I finished the book knowing so much more than before I picked it up. I also walked away disappointed in not only the four main characters but in other characters and the regulatory agencies that are in existence to enforce the laws of this country.  The author asserts that lying and perjury is at an epidemic and after reading the book, I think anyone would be hard pressed not to agree.  What troubles me is (and is by no way reflective of the author but instead of the world as it is):1.  Martha Stewart should have been charged with insider trading, as should Alisa Waksul and Sam Waksul's father.2.  Karl Rove and Richard Armitage should have been charged with outing Valerie Plame, a covert CIA agent.3.  Barry Bonds and all the other professional athletes who have been taking steroids should be charged with using prohibitive substances to enhance their athletic abilities.4.  The SEC should have uncovered Madoff's ponzi scheme.The stories leave me disappointed in the subject characters but also in the characters that are holding them to the standards we call laws.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Generally, I find his books compelling but, in this case, I am disappointed in his selection of big lies.  Of the five represented, Libby, of Watergate infamy, is barely cogent; Bonds, just plain boring.  Martha Stewart was only sort of interesting.  Not his best, by a long shot.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 starsA Naive Take on White Collar CrimeByNorman A. Pattison June 7, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseI wanted to fall in love with James Stewart’s Tangled Webs, (Penguin Press, New York: 2011). The subtitle alone persuaded me the author was on to something important: "How False Statements are Undermining America: From Martha Stewart to Bernie Madoff." But my love was not to be. I read my way to the very last page, more out of a sense of professional obligation than due to any sense that I was about to discover something new and important.I did not.But I did learn more than I ever thought I wanted to know about the nuts and bolts of the Martha Stewart prosecution and the prosecution of Barry Bonds. I read the sections on Bernie Madoff, but I still do not understand the investigation of him. Yes, I get that his investment firm was merely a gigantic Ponzi scheme, but the covering scam he used to deceive regulators and investors remains impenetrable to me. I am not sure that is Stewart’s fault, but I suspect it is.Stewart is, of course, right: The administration of justice depends on truth-telling. If we lie with impunity, then the center will not hold. Got it. In an ideal and transparent world, discovery of facts would be what the law school professors used to call "a mere matter of proof."Stewart has a lopsided view of the world. He frets about the consequences of witnesses who lie to the government without ever stopping to consider what happens when government lies to the people. This gives the book a quaint, 1950s kind of feel: If we all just told the truth, why everything would be all right.Reality is, and, frankly, always has been, a lot more nuanced.The government has perverted the grand jury process. A device once intended to protect people from an over-reaching government is now a secret tool the government uses to launch lengthy and intrusive searches. The cloak of grand jury secrecy is used to justify a one-sided game of hide and go seek. A federal agent might knock on your door to ask questions. He won’t tell you what others have said about you. He will tell you he cannot relay such information. But he will question you if you permit him to do so. And he will take notes. If those notes don’t match the account given by another witness, you just might face a federal prosecution for lying to a federal official. We let government define the truth while permitting it to deceive.Can someone tell me why it is a crime to lie to the government, but mere business as usual for the government to withhold the truth? The current rhetoric is that the government needs investigative tools to protect us against crime. There was a time in which we viewed ourselves more in need of protection from government. All we like sheep have gone astray. We don’t even know how many crimes are defined in the penal codes of the state and federal governments. We’re broke, and yet we imprison more folks per capita and for longer periods than any other nation on Earth. There’s something wrong here, all right.The fact that a few privileged plutocrats lied to the government and got caught is not what is undermining America. Stewart spend no time arguing this proposition. What is undermining the nation is the loss of a common set of interests and a common conception of right, the very things that Cicero long ago taught define a commonwealth. There is a crisis of legitimacy in the nation that runs far deeper than a few isolated prosecutions.I recently watched an interview with San Francisco’s Tony Serra on the topic of snitching, or becoming an informant for the government. Serra argues that it is wrong to snitch: it undermines a person’s sense of honor, and it undermines the adversarial process, thus turning us all into potential agents of the state when the price offered for what we have to say is right. The government can buy witnesses with liberty, Serra argues. A defendant who offers something to a witness gets charged with witness tampering. This asymmetry is fatal to liberty.So, too, with lying. We get the government we deserve. If we permit government to lie with impunity that cheapens the value of truth. Is it any wonder that a people distrustful of its government will lie to government agents?Clients who lie to government agents face the risk of jail time. They face that risk even if they tell the truth, so long as the government chooses to credit the contradictory tales told by another as truth. The fact of the matter is that determining what is truth is rarely simply a "mere matter of proof." Sometimes the truth is a matter of what one chooses to see. Giving the government a set of two-way mirrors in its search for truth blinds the very people and makes engaging the government risky business for us all.Go ahead and read Stewart’s book. It won’t hurt you. It is a painstaking recreation of several high-profile cases. The book can be read with profit by any criminal defense lawyer handling white-collar criminal cases. But don’t read the book to see what is undermining America. Stewart hasn’t a clue. He apparently believes that if we all just rolled over and gave the government what it wanted all would be well in this the best of all possible worlds.0Comment|

Real crime but reads like a crime drama.BySueon June 13, 2011Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThe book kept my attention all the way through. It's a potentially dull topic (perjury in high places) but Mr. Stewart kept it moving along witout adding artificial drama. There is a lot of detail,as was mentioned in at least one published review that I read, but Mr. Stewart did an excellent job of letting me know why it was all relevant. Happily, he also repeated identification of participants (attorneys and such) who are not well known names, so I was able to keep on reading without having to search back to figure out who the person is. It was like getting three books in one, and each kept me turning the pages. I also learned from it, which was my hope when I bought the book. I really expected it to read more like a public policy text book, and I imagine it may become that as well.0Comment|
