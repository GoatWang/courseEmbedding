  What is Digital Signage?Digital signage is a modern version of traditional signs or posters. The main difference is that we use web portal software to send visual content onto big flat TV screens that are connected to computers. It’s like having your OWN TV CHANNEL for less than the cost of a poster.So now you can throw-out all those old thumbtacks, because you will never have to hang another poster, EVER AGAINYou can see Digital Signage everywhere – in stores, malls, corporate towers, residential buildings and even museums. It uses technologies such as LCD, LED and Projection to display content in digital images, video, streaming media, and corporate information.MyMedia works as a Digital Signage Integrator, using all the tools and expertise you need to effectively create a solid communication channel.  How do we do it?In 2005, we started to work as a Toronto Digital Signage team for corporate initiatives across the city.  Since then, our Digital Signage team has grown to include New York City, providing us with the ability to scale large or small deployments.

Interactive Lobby Kiosk SolutionMarch 9, 2016Blog, interactive lobby, Kiosks, Mobile CheckInNo CommentsDid you ever go to a meeting and then have to wait in the lobby for several minutes to get processed as a visitor? Either the receptionist was too busy answering incoming phone calls or, better yet, she was unable to locate the person you came to meet because they were not at their desk?Fortunately, we’ve solved that problem with a self check-in that sends an instant notification to the individual you’re visiting.This video shows a recent installation that our Toronto Digital Signage team deployed downtown. It does a great job demonstrating how easy it is to use an interactive lobby kiosk solution.Are you wondering — what problem does it really solve? A lot of corporate offices today do not have a receptionist to greet and process visitors, even though they have high standards when it comes to documenting, processing and logging them. This poses a real challenge when a receptionist or security personnel is not situated in the front lobby.A few months ago, one of our Toronto clients asked us for a cost-effective and efficient way to process visitors on each floor of their corporate head office.Our solution was a kiosk with an interactive touch screen, enabling the visitor to sign-in by entering their first and last name, along with a company name. An optional feature is to have their photo taken, which can be kept for future records or sent to the person being visited.After they sign-in, the visitor enters their contact’s name. This step triggers an instant SMS message and voice mail, informing the contact that they have someone waiting for them in the lobby.At this point, the device prints out a badge/sticker for the visitor to wear and we are ready for business!This solution offers immediacy and also reduces wait times and the reliance on a front receptionist and security personnel.To learn more about this application, go to http://www.my-media.tv/applications/interactive-lobby/  Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn

Explainer Videos Has anyone ever asked you …Can you explain it to me in simple terms?Next thing you know,  you’re drawing things on a napkin or a white board.  After a few scribbles, you hear  “Oh now I get it!”Why? Because people understand ideas better in a visual format.Our brains are just wired that way.Despite this well-known fact, most messages are still being communicated through the written word — via emails, websites, brochures and white papers.The result? People are finding it extremely difficult to process all the textual information they are receiving. If they’re time-crunched, they”ll most likely skim through the literature without really understanding important pieces of it.  This is not good news if you have an important message that needs to stand out and resonate with your audience.The solution?MyMedia Animated explainer videos – a cost-effective way of visualizing your message that is both easy-to-understand and entertaining. If you’re concerned about the cost, don’t be.  MyMedia has several pre-packed template themes that make production for your video quick and economical.Get started today!Call us at 1-866-636-0636 extension 221Or fill in our contact form for us to contact you.

MyMedia is an image and video downloader and browser for iOS devices that integrates a number of useful tools to manage media files on your phone or iPad. The inclusion of a custom browser is nice and the media browser, while not as advanced as those in similar apps, is effective, allowing you to access and move through large volumes of audio, image, or video files on your phone, remotely.
When you set up MyMedia you will see a rundown of how the app works, complete with an outline of what it can do and what options you are given to work with the features of this app. The browser may look pared down, at first, but it uses many of the same features from Safari, combined with download tools that will move any media you encounter to your phone or tablet's library. You can then access these files, view them, move them to a cloud storage platform of your choosing, transfer them via Wi-Fi to iTunes, or delete them. Settings are also available to passcode lock your files or change how they are saved and backed up.
MyMedia ran smoothly in all of our tests, finding files, downloading them, and backing them up when we selected them. While the interface is cumbersome, at times, with some options hidden in unexpected places, the app is generally well made so you can find and access these files on the go, with ease.

MyMedia Update Brings PC-to-TV Casting Ability to Roku Users




Watch virtually any web video on your TV with MyMedia’s 
      Chromecast-like screen casting






August 14, 2014 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MediaMall Technologies, the company behind the popular PlayOn 
      streaming software, today announced the availability of an updated 
      version of MyMedia for Roku. MyMedia is a free media server software 
      application that allows users to stream personal media to their TVs via 
      the Roku player or Roku stick. The upgrade brings support for streaming 
      high definition personal media files for free as well as an optional 
      upgrade to include web casting. With the new $4.99 in-channel upgrade, 
      Roku users will now have Chromecast-like functionality, making it 
      possible to cast web videos directly from their PC to their TV via Roku 
      and the MyMedia channel.
    


      “MyMedia is a fantastic, extremely low-cost solution for Roku users that 
      want to stream personal media files like videos, pictures and music, as 
      well as web videos that may not be readily available on an existing Roku 
      channel,” said Jeff Lawrence, CEO, MediaMall Technologies. “MyMedia is 
      easy-to-use, can be set up in less than five minutes, and at a price of 
      only $5 for the casting capability, it is a steal for Roku users.”
    

      MyMedia is now available for free in the Roku Channel Store. The $4.99 
      upgrade, made directly through the MyMedia channel on Roku, gives users 
      access to the software’s easy-to-use casting interface. To download 
      MyMedia for free to your PC visit, http://www.playon.tv/mymedia. 
      Roku users can download the MyMedia channel from the 
      Roku Channel store.

Some Words From Our Clients





“When we started strategizing for an internal licensing system, Mediabox was our first choice. We knew Mediabox had all the parameters we needed to streamline our approvals, royalty tracking and agreement consolidation. The simplicity of the site made for an efficient transition for Pacific Cycle’s personnel and our licensed partners. There is no question, this is a very efficient and time-saving tool. Another important point is Mediabox’s staff; we lean on them regularly with questions and suggestions to see to the ever-changing needs of Pacific Cycle’s licensing tracking system and our partners’ approval protocol. They have been more then accommodating to our needs and continue to build-up their technology”
Pacific Cycle
“Mediabox has proven to be an invaluable tool for our staff, licensors and our licensees around the globe. The website, which is very user friendly, allows our brand and property images and artwork to be available immediately to everyone 24/7. It also allows us to be in charge of what is on the website and the ability to change the art offered and the user access rights – easily, from our own computer, and at any time of the day or night, without having to rely on an outside service’s availability. Mediabox has helped to reduce art fulfillment costs while freeing up valuable staff time to focus on more critical needs. It has been tremendously helpful for our company.”
Joester Loria Group

“As our business has evolved, we find ourselves dealing with increasing volumes of designs on ever expanding product categories. The Media Box system enables us to manage the design and approval process from concept right through to final samples. It allows us to respond to licensees efficiently, no matter where in the world we, or they, happen to be. One key advantage of Media Box is that multiple access by different users means that no matter how many people need to be involved and no matter how large the files, there are no longer long delays in information getting through.”
V&A

The introduction of Mediabox to ITV’s product approvals system has streamlined our process, allowing us more time to dedicate to each licensee and the creative input for all our branded products.”
ITV Studios

“Mediabox is easy to use and very reliable. We have been using it for several years and find that both our licensees and international agents are very pleased with it. The team at Media box is great to work with and always available for questions and advice on better ways to get the job done. We are very pleased with the experience.”

How It Works

PlayOn Desktop is a PC-based streaming video recorder and media server. When you select a show or movie from the PlayOn desktop app, an invisible browser opens and starts streaming the video from the selected streaming site (such as Netflix, or Hulu). PlayOn records online videos as they stream — just like a cable DVR or TiVo. Recordings are saved as .MP4 video files which can be easily transferred to an iPad or iPhone via iTunes, or to an Android mobile device. As an added bonus, when you play back recordings of network TV shows via an iOS, Roku, Chromecast, Android, or FireTV device, PlayOn’s AdSkip automatically skips the ads for you.

 "I love PlayOn. I love the SVR. Obviously one terabyte is not going to be enough storage. Three cheers for PlayOn Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!"
 "I save $20 on my cell phone bill every month now that I don't need so much data from Netflix!"
 "I use PlayOn all the time while traveling...it's a great app!"
 "At this point I've recorded 1,261 Movies, 222 TV Shows and 7957 Episodes — and I'm just getting started."
 "PlayOn is a lifesaver. We can still watch HBO GO on our old Roku because of it."
