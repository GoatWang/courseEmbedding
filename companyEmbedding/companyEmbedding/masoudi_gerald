Home  Product Liability  Preemption  Gerald Masoudi at ACI


Gerald Masoudi at ACI
By Lisa Baird on 10 December 2008 Posted in Preemption


Below are some notes regarding the presentation by the FDA’s Gerald Masoudi today at the ACI Drug and Device Conference. Every effort was made to capture his comments accurately, but please excuse any errors created by capturing these comments on a BlackBerry:
PREEMPTION
FDCA gives FDA role of determining safety and efficacy and warnings, considering factors including patient profile and public health considerations.
Labeling is key method by which FDA communicates risks and benefits. FDA decides for populations, not individuals, and requiring safety and efficacy for every individual would lead to the absence of treatments.
Even with proper risk benefit judgment and prescribing, injuries can occur.
Products should neither under- nor over-warn.
State tort lawsuits decrease patient access, limit treatment options and interfere with the agency’s judgments.
Preemption does not reach manufacturers’ failure to comply with federal requirements (such as contamination with toxic substance) since there would be no interference with the FDA’s judgment.
FDA will make mistakes, but allowing juries to make failure-to-warn determinations would not be superior to the current system and the current role of FDA.
In Wyeth v. Levine, the court may issue a narrow decision–we all will have to wait to see. But it is not new for FDA to support preemption. It has been the agency position in litigation, testimony, and preambles to rules. FDA reiterated its support recently in a pregnancy labeling proposed rule and CBE rule from earlier this year. This readoption should answer any question that the agency’s Final Rule on drug labeling, which also had preemption in a preamble, was improperly promulgated.
FUTURE OF PREEMPTION
The Wyeth decision, of course.
But what about preemption in off-label cases? Sponsor can’t change label without FDA approval. What if physician prescribes off-label because of some prompting by manufacturer? If plaintiff’s tort suit says there should have been warnings for the off-label use, the defense is less strong as there is little federal interest in off-label promotion. This area of law needs more development to answer the question.   
RIEGEL
There may be a legislative response, but again we will have to wait to see.
As to any exception for the manufacturer’s alleged failure to disclose to the FDA, when the FDA has not found fraud, the preemption defense is stronger. It would create interference with the agency’s decisions to allow courts to decide if the FDA was defrauded. Moreover, the FDA should decide what the punishment for it should be for manufacturer nondisclosure.
FDA WARNING LETTERS
FDA warning letters are a statement by the agency that someone is in violation of the law and legal action may be taken. For the past few years, the chief counsel’s office has reviewed all of them.
Because they involve a legal determination, and are very serious for the recipients, they are appropriate for attorney review.
Even if counsel review leads to fewer letters, which is not clear, stronger letters with a stronger impact is a beneficial result of counsel review. It adds heft to both the letter and to the agency’s decision to take an enforcement action, since recipients and the courts know the agency’s counsel has decided that legal action will be appropriate (if the conduct is not remedied) when warning letter issued.

Off-Label Promotion And The First Amendment Updates
By Lisa Baird on 22 September 2016 Posted in Clinical Trials, Industry Developments, Off-Label Use, Regulatory Developments

Although activity around the Amarin and Pacira cases has settled down, questions regarding the FDA’s position on truthful off-label promotion-and whether it comports with First Amendment free speech principles—persist.

As the FDA explained, the changes … Continue Reading






Attention Out-of-State Plaintiffs: The Tour Ends Here. Next Stop, Home
By Kevin Hara on 20 September 2015 Posted in Product Liability

Last year, the Supreme Court sent a resounding message regarding personal jurisdiction when it decided Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S.Ct. 746, 752 (2014).  Bauman announced a significantly more stringent standard for finding a corporation to be “essentially at home” in a foreign jurisdiction and, as a result, made personal jurisdiction harder to establish in … Continue Reading





First Amarin Pharm v. FDA, Now Pacira Pharm, Inc. v. FDA
By Lisa Baird on 11 September 2015 Posted in Clinical Trials, Industry Developments, Off-Label Use, Regulatory Developments

The Southern District of New York certainly is becoming a hotbed for issues relating to the FDA’s ability to take enforcement action against manufacturers who promote their FDA-regulated products for uses outside the approved label indications.  The Amarin Pharm v.

In our modern economy, businesses regularly use all manner of third-party consultants for many different reasons, including cost, efficiency, and expertise.  Less regularly, communications between businesses and consultants are the subject of discovery motion practice in litigation.  Two recent decisions out of the Southern District of New York demonstrate why businesses that use third-party consultants … Continue Reading

By Lisa Baird on 12 August 2015 Posted in Clinical Trials, Industry Developments, Off-Label Use, Regulatory Developments

The Southern District of New York’s preliminary injunction in Amarin Pharm, Inc. v. FDA—prohibiting the FDA from taking action against Amarin over truthful, non-misleading “off-label” statements about its prescription drug Vascepa—understandably has been big news, analyzed here  and  elsewhere. Some are asking whether the FDA will pursue appellate review of the decision.  An indication about … Continue Reading





Amarin Obtains Preliminary Injunction Against FDA Regarding Off-Label and First Amendment Issues
By Lisa Baird on 7 August 2015 Posted in Clinical Trials, Industry Developments, Off-Label Use, Regulatory Developments

In our prior posts about Amarin Pharma, Inc. v. FDA, we wondered what the Southern District of New York would make of Amarin’s request for an order prohibiting the FDA from taking enforcement actions against it over speech regarding “off-label” uses of its prescription drug, Vascepa.  Although Vascepa is regulated as a drug, equivalent products … Continue Reading





New Jersey’s DTC Advertising Exception to the Learned Intermediary Doctrine
By Andrew Stillusfen and Tsedey Bogale on 6 July 2015 Posted in Product Liability

When the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in Perez v.

However, since the ruling, every New Jersey court which has confronted this issue has found that the DTC exception did not … Continue Reading

FDA Sued By Drug Manufacturer Over Constitutional Right To Discuss Off-Label Uses
By Evelien Verpeet on 18 June 2015 Posted in Clinical Trials, Industry Developments, Off-Label Use, Regulatory Developments

The FDA has long sought to ban manufacturers from promoting off-label uses of approved drugs and medical devices.  In taking the position that manufacturers and their agents cannot promote off-label uses, the FDA suggests they are safeguarding the public from misbranded medical products and ensuring that manufacturers do not circumvent the drug- and device-approval processes. … Continue Reading

Insurance Coverage Considerations for Alleged Mislabeling of Herbal and Dietary Supplements
By Lisa Baird on 13 February 2015 Posted in Class Actions, Product Liability, Regulatory Developments

In the wake of the New York Attorney General's recent enforcement actions against four major retailers who allegedly sold herbal supplements that did not contain labeled ingredients or contained ingredients not explicitly identified on the labels, companies throughout the supply chain should consider examining their insurance policies to see whether or not they are sufficiently covered in the event of an investigation, enforcement action and/or litigation. Types of insurance policies that may provide coverage for affected companies are commercial general liability (CGL), directors and officers liability (D&O), errors and omissions liability (E&O), and product recall.… Continue Reading






3D Printing Raises Novel Questions About Potential Product Liability
By Lisa Baird on 11 February 2015 Posted in Health Care, Industry Developments, Product Liability

Over on the Drug & Device Law blog, Reed Smith partner Jim Beck (aka "Bexis") offers his thoughts on the possible product liability implications of printing 3D medical devices. Specifically, Jim examines the question of what party (or parties) would be held liable as the manufacturer in a product liability case involving 3D printing. There are uncertainties surrounding each of the three primary parties who may be considered for liability: the hospital that owns the 3D printer used to produce medical devices; the manufacturer of the 3D printer; or the designer of the software used by the 3D printer to create the products. Jim's post discusses the current issues around naming each of those parties as the manufacturer, and concludes that - at least for the time being - 3D printing presents an unusual situation in which it is feasible that no entity qualifies as a "manufacturer" under the Restatements for strict liability. Additional legal issues like this will likely emerge as 3D printing's popularity continues to increase.… Continue Reading





As 3D Printing Emerges, Legal Considerations and Challenges Arise
By Lisa Baird on 30 January 2015 Posted in Industry Developments, Product Liability

The January 25, 2015 edition of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette featured an article in which Reed Smith partner Chris Healy commented on the dramatic rise in popularity of 3D printing technology and the legal issues that have come about – and may arise in the future – as a result of this trend. The article, “3D … Continue Reading





A Call for Explicit Requirement of Ascertainability in Class Actions
By Lisa Baird on 27 January 2015 Posted in Class Actions, Product Liability

Over on the Drug & Device Law blog, Reed Smith partner Jim Beck (aka “Bexis”) makes a case for adding an explicit ascertainability requirement to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (Rule 23), presently under examination by the federal Advisory Committee on Civil Rules for possible amendment. Bexis points out that many courts already (properly) impose … Continue Reading

By Lisa Baird on 25 June 2013 Posted in Industry Developments, Legislative Developments, Preemption, Product Liability

As reported on Drug and Device Law Blog, in a five-to-four decision by Justice Alito, the Supreme Court has decided Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett, No. 12-142, slip op.

Supreme Court Holds State Law Failure to Warn Claims Against Generics Preempted
By Lisa Baird on 27 June 2011 Posted in Industry Developments, Preemption, Product Liability

This post was written by Christopher C. Foster. As many of you no doubt have heard, the United States Supreme Court last week decided that FDA regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers preempt state law “failure to warn” claims in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, Nos. 09–993, 09–1039, and 09–1501, 564 U.S. ___ (2011). Among other … Continue Reading





Latest Post-Levine Case Holds That Conflict Preemption Bars Plaintiff’s Failure-To-Warn Claims
By Lisa Baird and Michelle Lyu Cheng on 17 June 2011 Posted in Preemption, Product Liability

One of the strongest defenses against product liability claims, including a failure to warn claim, is federal preemption. For cases against prescription drug manufacturers, defense lawyers have specifically asserted conflict preemption to argue that failure to warn claims are preempted by the FDA’s regulations governing the content of labels for prescription drugs.

Courts Continue To Get Express Preemption Right In Medical Device Cases
By Michelle Lyu Cheng on 17 June 2009 Posted in Preemption

Since last year, a number of courts have interpreted and applied the express preemption holdings of Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 128 S.Ct. 999 (2008). Miller v. DePuy Spine, Inc., 07-cv-01639, 2009 US Dist LEXIS 49602 (D. Nev. May 1, 2009), is another example and, although it was decided on May 1, has just recently been picked up by LEXIS.
In Miller, the Nevada District Court granted summary judgment for the manufacturer of a PMA approved spinal implant disc called the Charite Artificial Disc. While many courts, including this one, correctly follow Riegel and hold that the state law claims challenging the design, manufacture and labeling claims are expressly preempted, this court also entered judgment for the defendant on warranty and misrepresentation claims that have a received a more mixed reception in some courts...… Continue Reading

Why Michigan’s “FDA Defense” Survives The Holding In Wyeth
By Michelle Lyu Cheng on 13 May 2009 Posted in Preemption, Product Liability

Washington Legal Foundation’s latest Legal Backgrounder, the "Logic of Michigan’s ‘FDA Defense’ Survives Recent Supreme Court Ruling", authored by Thomas J. Foley, explains why the Wyeth v. Levine, 129 S.Ct. 1187 (2009) ruling does not support a rationale to overturn Michigan law that provides a defense against drug product liability suits where the manufacturer obtained … Continue Reading





House Subcommittee Holds Hearing To Overturn Riegel: H.R. 1346, the “Medical Device Safety Act of 2009”
By Michelle Lyu Cheng on 13 May 2009 Posted in Legislative Developments, Preemption

On May 12, 2009 the Subcommittee on Health, of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, held a hearing on H.R. 1346, the "Medical Device Safety Act of 2009". If passed, it would overturn the Supreme Court decision, Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 128 S.Ct. 999 (2008), which held that under the express preemption clause of the Medical Devices Amendment of 1976 (MDA), the federal requirements created by the premarket approval process for Class III devices preempted state law tort claims that added or differed from the federal requirements. This hearing comes at the heels of public and media scrutiny of this decision, including last year's House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform preemption hearing held May 14, 2008 and the Senate Judiciary Committee's preemption hearing held June 11, 2008.
Before the invited panel of witnesses spoke, numerous members of the subcommittee provided opening remarks, which reflected the division among those who argued that the Supreme Court's analysis in Riegel departed from the legislative intent of the MDA, and those who agreed that the pending legislation would prevent innovation and access to medical devices that are life-saving. Arguments against the bill also noted that moving against preemption would otherwise place safety concerns in the hands of juries across the country, instead of on the FDA's safety and efficacy evaluations. Some focus was also placed on the FDA's effectiveness in policing the manufacturers, with several congress members such as Representative John Dingle, MI and Henry Waxman, CA arguing that the FDA has not been able to identify and take action on defective products, therefore calling into question their effectiveness in ensuring safety, while other congress members such as Representatives Steve Buyer, IN and Michael Burgess, TX argued that if the FDA is underfunded and without resources, the Committee should focus on the FDA, not on tort reform...… Continue Reading

Class II Special Controls Preemption
By Lisa Baird on 29 December 2008 Posted in Preemption

The FDA on Monday issued a proposed rule to classify "tissue expanders" as Class II (special controls) medical devices. These devices are "intended for temporary (less than 6 months) subdermal implantation to stretch the skin for surgical applications."
What makes this notice interesting is preemption. In Riegel v. Medtronic, 128 S.Ct. 999 (2008), the Supreme Court upheld preemption in part because it concluded that the premarket approval (or PMA) process for Class III medical devices results in "federal requirements" specific to the approved device. In the tissue expander proposed rule, the FDA explains its view that these special controls also amount to federal requirements that should result in preemption. It states:
"In this proposed rulemaking, FDA has tentatively determined that general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and that there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance. FDA therefore proposes to establish special controls to address the issues of safety or effectiveness identified in the special controls draft guidance document. If this proposed rule is made final, these special controls would create 'requirements' for specific medical devices under 21 U.S.C. 360k, even though product sponsors would have some flexibility in how they meet those requirements (Papike v. Tambrands, Inc., 107 F.3d 737, 740-42 (9th Cir. 1997)). In addition, if this rule becomes final, as with any Federal requirement, if a State law requirement makes compliance with both Federal law and State law impossible, or would frustrate Federal objectives, the State requirement would be preempted. (See Geier v. American Honda Co., 529 U.S. 861 (2000); English v. General Electric Co., 496 U.S. 72, 79 (1990); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc., 373 U.S. 132, 142-43 (1963); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941).)"
Although this is the first reference we have seen to Riegel in a proposed rule to establish Class II special rules, the FDA is actually not breaking new ground. In 1997, the Papike upheld preemption in a case involving tampons (a Class II device) and an alleged failure to adequately warn of toxic shock syndrome since the FDA had issued regulations specifying the toxic shock syndrome required for tampon packaging. Other tampon cases have followed Papike, and there have been a few latex glove cases, too. See, e.g., Whitson v. Safeskin Corp., 313 F.Supp.2d 473, 479 (M.D. Pa. 2004); Busch v. Ansell Perry, Inc., 2005 WL 877805 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 8, 2005).… Continue Reading

The gap that the Supreme Court’s non-precedential decision, Warner-Lambert Co., LLC v. Kent, 128 S.Ct. 1168 (2008), left open earlier this year continues to force the lower courts to take sides, as was done in the latest case – Grange v. Mylan Labs., Inc., Case No. 1:07-CV-107 (N.D. Utah Oct. 31, 2008). Specifically, the controversy remains … Continue Reading

The Other Express Preemption: Don’t Overlook Over-the-Counter Drugs
By Michelle Lyu Cheng on 7 November 2008 Posted in Preemption

In Carter v. Novartis Consumer Health, Inc., --- F. Supp. 2d --- , No. EDCV08-0334 MRP (JCRx) (C.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 2008) and its companion cases, the Central District of California addressed the express preemption clause of Section 379r of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act governing OTC drugs. Here, the parents of children younger than age 6 filed a complaint against manufacturers alleging that the OTC cough and cold medicines "d[id] not work" and were dangerous to their children. There were no requests for damages based on injuries, but rather for the economic harm of purchasing these products. Plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief, pursuant to various state consumer fraud statutes, and each case sought to certify a class on behalf of all others similarly situated.
The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss based on federal preemption for all of the claims (unjust enrichment, false and misleading advertising, fraudulent concealment, unfair and deceptive business practices, and breach of express and implied warranties), noting that OTC cough and cold medicines are regulated by the FDA pursuant to the OTC monograph, generally described within 21 CFR part 341. Such OTC monographs set forth approved indications for use and age-dependent dosage instructions that must comply with all FDA regulations, and are therefore generally recognized as safe and effective. Claims attacking these federal "requirements" therefore preempted the state "requirements" established by the state law claims. Of particular note was the court's understanding that the state requirements were not defined by its label, but "its ultimate outcome: would a finding of liability impose requirements that are different from or in addition to FDA requirements?" p. 13. Because the claims were premised on attacks based upon FDA-approved statements in product labeling and advertising, such claims were preempted.… Continue Reading





JAMA on Preemption
By Lisa Baird on 21 October 2008 Posted in Preemption

Tomorrow's JAMA contains an editorial entitled, "Prescription Drugs, Products Liability, and Preemption of Tort Litigation" (subscription) by Catherine D. DeAngelis; Phil B. Fontanarosa (JAMA. 2008;300(16):1939-1941 (doi:10.1001/jama.2008.513)).
Suffice it to say, the premise that tort litigation safeguards patient health is faulty. Ensuring patient access to innovative and needed medical options is essential. See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 999, 1009 (2009) (discussing the express preemption statute for medical devices and stating, "the text of the statute - suggests that the solicitude for those injured by FDA-approved devices, which the dissent finds controlling, was overcome in Congress's estimation by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.")… Continue Reading
