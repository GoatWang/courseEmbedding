About
Award-winning and innovative, Opportunity Fund is California's leading microfinance provider. 

Opportunity Fund believes that small amounts of money and financial advice can help people make permanent and lasting change in their own lives, driving economic mobility and building stronger communities. We say “Yes!” to small business owners, low-income students, and families because entrepreneurship, education, and sound financial habits are proven pathways to greater economic opportunity.   Our strategy combines microloans for small business owners and microsavings accounts to help students pay for college and families save for a rainy day. As California’s leading microfinance provider, our team has deployed $516 million and helped more than 20,000 people since 1994.
 

 
MissionTo advance the economic well-being of working people by helping them earn, save and invest in their future.
VisionOpportunity Fund believes that everyone should have the chance to build a dignified life, regardless of their economic background. Our role is to help working families realize their dreams and move beyond worrying about how to live day to day. By investing in those who don’t have ready access to financial resources, we strive to break the cycle of poverty for good.
Core Values
 

Message from CEO, Eric Weaver
At the beginning - when Opportunity Fund was just an idea - we didn’t know if small amounts of money and financial advice could be enough to enable people to make big changes for the better. But I believed there was a way for working people to achieve life goals that once seemed out of reach, simply because they didn’t have the financial means or know-how. Over the last 20 years, we have seen individuals graduate from higher education programs, purchase homes, save at a higher rate than the average American, start small businesses that provide sustainable income and create jobs, and build assets for their families. Most tell us that they could not have done it without the help Opportunity Fund provided. But to me, it’s clear: all our clients needed was your belief in them and a chance to succeed.
I am proud that Opportunity Fund’s investors and staff recognize that entrepreneurship, hard work, and ideas—the pillars of Silicon Valley businesses—are also the pillars of its lower income communities. Together, we are building a diverse, vibrant community where opportunity, knowledge, and access to capital are within reach for everyone living in the Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles.

  Products & Performance  Long/Short Hedge Fund










Long/Short Hedge Fund



The Tech Bust. The Global Financial Crisis. The Crescat Long/Short Hedge Fund strongly outperformed during two of the worst bear markets in history. Investors in the Long/Short Fund value the fund’s strong risk-adjusted returns, achieved with a focus on long and short equities.

Net Returns through 5/31/2017
Risk-Adjusted Return Measures Since Inception
Growth of Initial $1,000,000
Peer Group Analysis from eVestment, inception through December, 2015

Crescat Capital LLC manages hedge funds and separate accounts through its wholly owned subsidiary, Crescat Portfolio Management LLC, an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Registration as an investment adviser does not imply a certain level of skill or training.
Crescat Portfolio Management claims compliance with Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). Prospective clients can obtain a compliant presentation and the firm’s list of composite descriptions by contacting Crescat by phone at (303) 271-9997, or by visiting our website at www.crescat.net/resources/due-diligence/. Returns are presented net of management fees and performance fees. The currency used to express performance is U.S. dollars.
Strategy and Composite Description
The Crescat Long/Short Hedge Fund Composite includes all accounts that are managed according to the firm’s long/short equity hedge fund strategy over which the manager has full discretion. This hedge fund strategy strives to grow and protect client capital through an actively-managed, prudently-diversified, long-biased, long/short equity portfolio comprised of liquid large- and mid-cap global equities. The manager follows a multi-disciplinary, value-based investment process with risk controls. The strategy blends top-down, macroeconomic analysis with bottom-up, fundamental valuation. The investment team’s macroeconomic analysis includes the valuation of currencies, commodities, industries, and markets in order to develop global macroeconomic investment themes that are expressed in the strategy through long and short equity positions. The manager may trade and invest in individual equities as well as exchange-traded funds and related options. The strategy employs a moderate amount of leverage within constraints based on the investment team’s assessment of market risks and opportunities. The strategy’s bottom-up approach to equity valuation starts with a proprietary, fundamental, quantitative model that was originally built in 1997 by the firm’s Chief Investment Officer, Kevin C. Smith, CFA. The model applies an innovative and robust discounted-free-cash-flow methodology to produce daily valuations of the top 2,000 largest and most-liquid global equities that trade on a U.S. exchange. The fundamental quant model has been consistently refined and applied to managing this strategy since its inception. The investment team performs additional qualitative analysis to validate buy and sell signals generated by the model and to integrate model-driven ideas with the firm’s macro themes. The goal of the strategy is to generate high risk-adjusted returns as measured by top-decile Alpha, Sortino Ratio, Omega Ratio, and Gain-Loss Ratio that are in the top 10% of all global hedge fund managers over the long term whose strategy is predominantly long/short equity.
Benchmark Descriptions
The S&P 500 Index is perhaps the most commonly followed stock market index. It is considered representative of the US stock market at large. It is a market-cap-weighted index of the 500 largest and most liquid companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. While the companies are U.S. based, most of them have broad global operations. Therefore, the index is representative of the broad global economy. It is a suitable benchmark for the Crescat Long/Short Hedge Fund Composite which has also traded extensively in large, highly-liquid global equities through U.S.-listed securities.
The HFRX Equity Hedge Index represents an investable index of hedge funds that trade both long and short in global equity securities. Managers of funds in the index employ a wide variety of investment processes. They may be broadly diversified or narrowly focused on specific sectors and can range broadly in terms of levels of net exposure, leverage employed, holding period, concentrations of market capitalizations and valuation ranges of typical portfolios. It is a suitable benchmark for Crescat Long/Short Fund because it has also been predominantly composed of long and short global equities since inception.
Private Securities Offering Legend For Crescat Global Macro Fund LP and Crescat Long/Short Fund LP (Hereafter “Crescat fund or Crescat funds”)
Only accredited investors and qualified clients will be admitted as limited partners to a Crescat fund. For natural persons, investors must meet SEC requirements including minimum annual income or net worth thresholds. Crescat funds are being offered in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and are not required to comply with specific disclosure requirements that apply to registration under the Securities Act. The SEC has not passed upon the merits of or given its approval to the Crescat funds, the terms of the offering, or the accuracy or completeness of any offering materials. A registration statement has not been filed for any Crescat fund with the SEC. Limited partner interests in the Crescat funds are subject to legal restrictions on transfer and resale. Investors should not assume they will be able to resell their securities. Investing in securities involves risk. Investors should be able to bear the loss of their investment. Investments in the Crescat funds are not subject to the protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Performance data represents past performance, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance data is subject to revision following each monthly reconciliation and annual audit. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data presented. Crescat is not required by law to follow any standard methodology when calculating and representing performance data. The performance of Crescat funds may not be directly comparable to the performance of other private or registered funds. Investors may obtain the most current performance data and private offering memorandum for a Crescat fund by contacting Linda Smith at (303) 271-9997 or by sending a request via email to lsmith@crescat.net. See the private offering memorandum for each Crescat fund for complete information and risk factors.
