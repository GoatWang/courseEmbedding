Drift









Picture yourself floating down a tranquil river in a wooden boat. With the gentle current as your only guide, you have no particular destination. Your mind is free to wander. If that feeling of freedom and relaxation sounds appealing, we’ve got good news: we bottled it.

Meet Drift™, our fast-acting sublingual spray that gives you the ease of a vape pen without the smoke. Bring it along to bars, concerts, parties and anywhere else you want to pass the joy around.

WHAT'S INSIDE
Each bottle contains 100 mg of THC from the best locally sourced cannabis, infused into an organic, cold-extracted peppermint oil.

HOW IT WORKS
Spray Drift™ under your tongue, hold it there for 30 seconds and within five to fifteen minutes, you’ll be enjoying a smooth, subtle body high. Every spray contains exactly 1.6 mg of THC, so it’s easy to build your own experience.

WHY IT'S DIFFERENT
When we set out to create a smokeless high that would work more quickly and reliably, we developed a groundbreaking delivery system we call Gravitine™. Exclusive to our Drift™ product, Gravitine™ enhances bioavailability to quickly deliver the full range of cannabinoids directly into your bloodstream. The result? A sublingual experience that’s up to four times faster than any other non-smoked marijuana product, and up to 3 times more potent than conventional tinctures. It’s healthier than smoking, easier to control than edibles, and tastes way better than a tincture. In other words, there is nothing else like Drift™.
