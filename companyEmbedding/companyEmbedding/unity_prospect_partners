Prospect Partners, LLC is a private equity firm that invests in management-led leveraged recapitalizations and buyouts of U.S.-based smaller lower-middle-market companies generating revenues typically under $75 million. Since its inception in 1998, Prospect Partners has raised $470 million in three institutionally-supported private equity funds focused on small niche leaders. Over that time, Prospect Partners has invested nationwide in more than 135 companies in diverse manufacturing, distribution, and service markets, including various specialty consumer, business, healthcare, and industrial industry segments.[1]
Prospect Partners generally invests in profitable, growth-ready companies led by strong management teams that continue to run the business and drive its success.
As an opportunistic investor, Prospect Partners pursues transactions in a number of ways: by working with current management teams seeking a recapitalization, by backing outside executives in a buyout, and by co-investing with independent equity sponsors. Private equity situations in which the firm invests include leveraged expansions, industry consolidations, corporate orphans, transitional sales, and undermanaged companies. Prospect Partners seeks to build equity value in its companies over time through internal growth and/or subsequent acquisitions.[1]
In August, 2010, Prospect Partners closed its third fund.[2] Investors in Prospect Partners III, L.P include some of the nation’s leading financial managers: Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Performance Equity Management, LLC, the University of Notre Dame, Northern Trust, Commonfund Capital, and RCP Advisors.[3]

Testimonials





                                	"Kumar has been associated with us since the beginning of 2010. In the last one year, Prospect Partners have been able to 
                                    add tremendous value to our Recruitment process. Kumar and his team come in with a strong sense of purpose and drive. 
                                    Their quick comprehension of both the position as well as the market for that position gives them an edge over most other 
                                    Consultants. The scanning and depth adds a different dimension to the process rarely seen, so much so, they give the 
                                    Client the comfort of being able to choose not only the best but also from the complete pool available. This becomes 
                                    crucial especially when you are dealing with niche positions, which in the case of xxx, we most often do. 
                                

                                	Prospect Partners have also turned their lack of geographical presence into a strength, as they constantly are in touch 
                                    with you on every mandate. The ownership, earnestness and sincerity of purpose becomes a reality when they are willing to 
                                    travel across the ocean to service you at your doorstep - one gets to see true business partnering in action". 
                                

                                	HR Manger (Head Talent Acquisition and HR Operations)One of the most admired, Fortune 500

                                	"Since the last three years Prospect Partners have been supporting us with middle and senior level recruitment especially 
                                    in life sciences where our company operates, i.e. Healthcare and CropScience. 
                                

                                	Some of these searches had high confidentiality reuirements, speed and accuracy of the search process. 
                                

                                	I must say that Mr. Kumar Krishnan with his network in these industries was able to respond very fast and convince the 
                                    right candidates to present their candidature and also offiered consultative support both to candidates and the company 
                                    through the hiring process. 
                                

                                	As a company that continuously calibrates our brand presence, we have received supportive and constructive feedback from 
                                    Mr. Krishnan after each of the recruitment assignments. Similarly, the feedback which we have given to Prospect Partners 
                                    has also been acknowledged and we see that the improvments have been implemented in their internal process accordingly. 
                                

                                	We continue to work with Prospect Partners and have no hesitation in referring the work they have done for us to any other 
                                    interested parties.

Prospect Partners LLC has recapitalized Itasca, Illinois-based QMI Security Solutions, a maker of physical security and protection products for commercial and residential applications.
PRESS RELEASE
Chicago, Ill.— June 20, 2017: Prospect Partners, LLC, a leading private equity firm investing in lowermiddle-market companies, today announced its recapitalization, with management, of QMI Security Solutions, Inc. (QMI), of Itasca, Ill.
QMI is the leading manufacturer of physical security and protection products for commercial and residential applications, offering stylish, high-quality barriers that deter retail break-ins, prevent theft, and protect against storms. QMI provides security protection for both exterior and interior spaces in addition to repairs and replacements. The company’s custom products include rolling shutters for storefronts, counters, and cases, as well as side folding shutters, hurricane rolling shutters, and screens. QMI reaches a diverse customer base of retail bank chains, mass merchandisers, pharmacies, wireless stores, and households throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Jim Miller, who founded the business in 1986, will continue to lead QMI as President and CEO.
“QMI is an exceptional niche market leader, with top-rated products, a deep commitment to innovation, and a ‘customer-first’ operating strategy,” said Brett Holcomb, a Principal of Prospect Partners. “QMI has consistently set the industry standard for product design and capabilities, and we are excited to partner with Jim and his team to continue building upon the company’s strong brand going forward.” 





Said QMI President and CEO Miller: “Prospect Partners has a great reputation for working as true partners with many successful companies like ours. The team’s belief in our mission, coupled with its investment and support, will help us aggressively pursue many growth initiatives, including developing more physical security products for current and new end markets and expanding QMI’s distribution and market reach. We look forward to this new chapter together.”
QMI becomes Prospect Partners’ 49th portfolio company overall, and the 13th in the firm’s current fund, Prospect Partners III, L.P.
Serving on the board of the holding company, QMI Holding, Inc., from Prospect Partners are Mr. Holcomb, as Chairman, and Rick Tuttle, Founding Principal, as a Director. QMI’s Mr. Miller also serves as a Director.
