Asta Funding Announces The Formation Of A Wholly Owned Subsidiary To Expand Its Personal Injury Claims Funding Business






GlobeNewswire



Nov 15, 2016 4:05 PM EST













 




























































 ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., Nov. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asta Funding, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASFI) (the "Company"), today announced the formation of a wholly owned subsidiary Simia Capital, LLC ("Simia") to continue its position as a leader in the personal injury claims funding business.  The Company has been in the personal injury funding claims business since 2011, operating through Pegasus Funding, LLC ("Pegasus"), an 80% owned indirect subsidiary.  The Pegasus joint venture expires December 28, 2016, and will not be renewed. Instead, the Company has made the decision to liquidate its existing Pegasus portfolio and expand its position in the personal injury claims business by forming Simia, a wholly owned subsidiary.  Gary Stern, Asta Chairman, president and CEO said, "We have enjoyed success over the last five years in the personal injury claims funding business, and we have renewed our commitment to this business segment by establishing a wholly owned entity to conduct its operations moving forward.  Effective January 2, 2017, the Company will begin funding personal injury claims through Simia.  We are excited to expand our presence in this business segment, and look to this as being an important component of the Company's overall growth strategy."  As part of the formation, Simia has retained former GWG MCA Capital, Inc. Chief Executive Officer Patrick F. Preece, who joined Simia as its Chief Executive Officer on November 11, 2016 and has been appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company, effective November 15, 2016.  Mr. Preece was head of asset securitization for Autobahn Funding, a $6 billion commercial paper conduit for DZ Bank that specialized in alternative asset classes.  Throughout his career Mr. Preece has focused on the origination and management of structured finance and asset-backed lending with an emphasis on litigation finance. Mr. Stern added, "Patrick has a wealth of experience, exceptional industry knowledge and an in-depth understanding of the marketplace.  I am confident that Patrick's significant experience in structured settlements, asset-backed lending and esoteric assets will enhance the Company's position in the personal injury funding business, as well as other asset classes that the Company may consider as future investments, and will be a great addition to our existing management team."

GWG Expands Into Merchant Cash Advance Market
Announces Acquisition of Management Team and Assets



















March 04, 2016 16:05 ET

 | Source: GWG Holdings, Inc.






MINNEAPOLIS, March  04, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GWG Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:GWGH) (“GWG” or “the Company”), a specialty finance company and a leader in the life insurance secondary market, today announced its expansion into the merchant cash advance arena with the acquisition and formation of subsidiary GWG MCA Capital, Inc. (“GWG Merchant Cash Advance”). New York-based GWG Merchant Cash Advance provides capital to small businesses nationwide, filling a significant gap in the market for small business funding created by the increased capital and regulatory burdens of traditional lenders. GWG Merchant Cash Advance acquired a $4.3 million portfolio of loans and advances from a subsidiary of Walker Preston Capital. As part of the transaction, GWG Merchant Cash Advance retained former Walker Preston Capital Chief Executive Officer Patrick F. Preece, who has joined GWG Merchant Cash Advance as its President and Chief Operating Officer. Prior to Walker Preston Capital, Mr. Preece was head of asset securitization for Autobahn Funding, a $6.0 billion commercial paper conduit for DZ Bank that specialized in alternative asset classes. Throughout his career, Mr. Preece has focused on the origination and management of structured finance and asset-backed lending with an emphasis on specialty finance. “We are excited to welcome Patrick Preece to GWG’s senior executive team and have him lead this new operating division for us,” said GWG Holdings’ Chief Executive Officer Jon Sabes. He added, “The merchant cash advance division provides GWG with another unique alternative asset class that we expect to contribute profitable earnings and shorter-term duration cash flows to the Company. We expect this division will enhance the value of GWG to its investors, shareholders, and independent financial advisors. Patrick and his team have the resources and expertise to execute our merchant cash advance strategy while bringing senior management acumen and resources to GWG Holdings.” GWG Merchant Cash Advance provides secured loans to established merchant cash advance funders as well as funding advances directly to small businesses across the United States. The combination of product offerings is intended to drive a consistent flow of transactions with attractive risk-adjusted yields to GWG Merchant Cash Advance. “The disintermediation of traditional small business lenders – banks and credit unions – is proceeding unabated,” said GWG Merchant Cash Advance President Patrick Preece. “The steady decline in the share of small business loans provided by banks and credit unions1 creates tremendous opportunities for specialty finance companies such as GWG Merchant Cash Advance.” Experts estimate there is a potential $80 to $120 billion in unmet demand for capital from small businesses, with the merchant cash advance industry’s current size estimated to be approximately $10 billion.2 The establishment of GWG Merchant Cash Advance expands GWG Holdings’ portfolio of assets as well as adding depth to its senior management team. About GWG Holdings, Inc. GWG Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:GWGH) is a specialty finance company and a leader in the secondary market for life insurance. GWG is dedicated to creating a vibrant secondary life insurance market for the economic benefit of seniors seeking post-retirement financial solutions, investors seeking yield derived from non-correlated assets, financial advisors seeking value-added products and services for their clients, and shareholders seeking to benefit from the growth of this marketplace. As of September 30, 2015, GWG’s growing portfolio consisted of $879 million in face value of benefits.
