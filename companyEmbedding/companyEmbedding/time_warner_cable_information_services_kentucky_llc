This document will assist Trading Partners of Time Warner Cable (TWC) in gaining access to the TWC GUI and placing Local Service Requests (LSRs) for porting numbers.






1. Purpose and Audience 


This user guide is directed to those personnel responsible for submitting industry requests to Time Warner Cable (TWC), including order entry and management for number portability.  This document provides guidelines for accessing the TWC graphical user interface (GUI), placing port orders and requirements for one day simple ports, and placing standard or complex port orders.





2. Getting Started


To access the TWC GUI and place a Local Service Request (LSR) for porting out numbers, a carrier must have a user ID and password. Each Trading Partner must complete and submit a Trading Partner Summary and Porting Information forms to: 
Carrier@twcable.com
Once the user ID and password are assigned, the carrier may access the TWC GUI at https://twc-port.neustar.com/gateway/.





3. Ordering Guidelines


The following are guidelines for completing and submitting LSRs to TWC for the purpose of porting a TN away from TWC. 

The end user name and address provided on the End User Form must exactly match the service address and location section of the Customer Service Inquiry response for all TWC commercial accounts.
The operating company number (OCN)/state should be selected based off the numbering plan area (NPA) of the telephone number being requested.  TWC will only port telephone numbers that are used for two-way communication.
Telephone numbers not converted by the new number service provider (NNSP) do not need to be addressed on the LSR. TWC will not disconnect unwanted TNs identified on a LSR port request. The customer will need to contact TWC directly (identified on the bill) to arrange for disconnection of any unwanted TNs.
Desired due dates over 30 calendar days from the submitted date will not be accepted.
Rejected LSRs will be cancelled after five business days. LSR charges may apply pursuant to the terms of the applicable industry agreement.
If you feel your LSR has been improperly rejected, send an e-mail to twc.serviceordersupport@twcable.com
LSRs containing more than 20 telephone numbers, unless otherwise stated in your industry agreement, will be handled as a project. Both parties will negotiate implementation details, including due date/time. 

Project requests should be emailed to twc.serviceordersupport@twcable.com. 
The subject line should state: Project Request/ATN/AN. The body of the email should include the number of telephone numbers porting, desired due date (DDD), and the purchase order number (PON) to be submitted. 
Once approved, TWC will respond with a project code to be placed in the project field (field 20) on the LSR. LSRs submitted with more than 20 telephone numbers that do not include the approved project code will be rejected. LSRs submitted as a project are subject to normal LSR validation.


                                             
                                        




4. Simple Ports

Following are guidelines intended to assist in placing LSRs for Porting numbers out from Time Warner Cable.

Port orders received in complex format must pass complex edits prior to resolving one day vs. complex to determine due date.  DDD for non-simple ports must be a minimum of three business days from the LSR submission date. If the LSR is submitted before 3pm EST this will count as day one. LSRs submitted after 3pm EST are considered to be received the next business day.  The NNSP field is required on all requests for number portability.
In instances where the LSR indicates the port request is non-simple based on the current FCC definition and rule for a simple port, TWC will return a FOC or appropriate response within 24 clock hours.
TWC creates the SV in NPAC for number portability requests.
The NNSP will be responsible for concurring with the SV in order to proceed with the porting process.
Where technically feasible, TWC will apply the ten-digit trigger (TDT) to all TNs being ported out. The TDT will be placed in the switch the day prior to the FOC due date. If the parties agree to a coordinated hot cut, TWC will allow the NNSP 30 minutes from the desired frame due time to activate the telephone number in NPAC. If 30 minutes expires and the TN has not been activated, TWC will rewrite the internal order and send a cancellation notice via TWC GUI. If any of the telephone numbers need to be ported, a new LSR will be required by the NNSP to process the request.
If a coordinated hot cut is not requested, numbers activated by the NNSP in NPAC will be removed from the TWC switch the day following activation by the NNSP.  Telephone numbers will not be removed from the TWC switch until the NPAC version has been activated by the NNSP.
The FOC is only good for five business days past the due date on the FOC. The NPAC SV will be cancelled the sixth day following the FOC due date if activation has not occurred in NPAC or if a supplemental LSR has not been submitted. TWC will rewrite the internal order and send a cancellation notice via TWC GUI. If any of the canceled TNs need to be ported, a new LSR will be required by the NNSP to process the request.
When a disconnection activity type is submitted for a TWC native TN, the number must be in a pending-disconnect status in NPAC.
Any port out order of more than 20 lines requires a negotiated due date and may require a coordinated cutover.  The NNSP must contact TWC to negotiate the due date and the necessity of a coordinated cutover.  For orders of more than 20 lines, contact TWC Carrier Relations Organization at: carrier@twcable.com.
LSR status (FOC or cancel) will be provided within 24 hours of receipt for requests with 1 to 20 TNs. For LSRs containing over 20 TNs, responses will be sent within 72 hours of receipt. These intervals are not applicable in cases where states have specific interval rules associated with this activity. 
Requests with one stand-a-lone residential telephone number will be assigned a FOC date of four business days from the day a clean LSR was received. Requests with 1 to 20 TNs will be assigned a FOC date of 5 business days to complete the procedure from the day a clean LSR was received. TWC considers port out requests of more than 20 TNs a project and the interval will be negotiated. A response will be received within 48 hours informing of the due date issued. The regional office will review the request and provide FOC as appropriate to the size and complexity of the request via the normal confirmation process. 





5.4  Supplement Requests


If the order is in FOC “Accept”, then changing the due date for less than five business days does not require a supplement. TWC will accept a supplement up to 3pm EST the day before the due date or FOC expiration date.   The NNSP must issue a supplemental order to TWC to identify any modifications to the original request.  All modifications to the original request will impact the original confirmed due date. Supplement requests received on the desired due date can experience technical difficulties; therefore, it is recommended that supplements be sent 24 hours prior to the desired due date.



5.5  Partial Port Indicator


A partial port out affects only the telephone numbers identified on the NNSP’s LSR.  The TNs not identified on the LSR remain in service with TWC and are billed appropriately. To assist with the identification and proper processing of partial port out orders, TWC requests the population of a full/partial port indicator on the LSR by the NNSP.
Note: TWC does not accept expedited port out requests (advancing the standard DD) from any service provider, unless there is a service-impacting situation caused by TWC. 



5.6  Service Restrictions


The following service restrictions apply when porting out from TWC:

Ported TNs port within the constraints placed on them by the FCC and specific state regulations. 
The numbers listed below are examples of numbers, which are not portable, as well as their underlying provisioned TN:

555, 960 and 976 NXXs
500, 700, 900, 911 services
Other N11 codes (e.g. 411, 511)

Numbers used for mass calling events cannot be ported.
The TWC policy, regarding the porting of reserved TNs, is to allow porting when reserved numbers are on the end-user service record.
Porting service request restricted on unassigned, previously owned, disconnected, disconnected following suspension for non-payment, or numbers associated with paging services cannot be ported.




5.7  Expedited LSRs


TWC does not accept expedited port requests (advancing the standard DD interval) unless there is a service-impacting situation.  TWC will only consider support of an expedited port on an individual case basis with particular focus on preventing the customer from being out of service.  NNSP must notify and receive approval from the CLEC Operations contact before advancing the due date. If approval is received to advance the DDD less than the standard LSR interval (three days), the expedite field must be populated with a Y.



5.8  Cancellations


For service assurance, it is best to submit cancel requests (SUP1) by 3pm EST the day before the due date or FOC expiration date.  For anything after 3pm the day before, contact:

For residential and commercial orders:  CLEC Operations at 877-594-6039, select option 1, and TWC will try their best to accommodate.

Note: For special projects service assurance, TWC must receive the cancel request (SUP1) by 3pm two days prior to the due date to prevent service interruption.



5.8.1  Same Day Cancellation Contact


For same day cancellations, or next day cancellations submitted after 3pm, submit the cancel request (SUP1) and call TWC to notify of cancellation.  For residential and commercial cancellations, call CLEC Operations at 877-594-6039.



5.8.2  Cancel FOC Policy


TNs not activated at NPAC within five business days from the FOC due date will be canceled by TWC (SPID 853C).  TWC will cancel the subscription at NPAC and issue a cancellation notice to the former NNSP.  If any of the canceled numbers need to be ported, a new LSR will be required by the NNSP to process the request.
