Greetings, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the SGI third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Annie Leschin. Thank you, you may begin.
Annie Leschin
Thank you operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to SGI's third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jorge Titinger, President and CEO and Mack Asrat, CFO.
This call is being webcast and a replay of that webcast will be available on our website two hours after the conclusion of the call and will remain available until the next earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to mention that SGI will be attending the D. A. Davidson Technology Forum in New York on June 1 and the Stifel Internet and Media Conference in San Francisco on June 6.
As a reminder, many of the financial measures that we will be discussing are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise indicated. A full reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in our earnings release and posted on our website. Let me remind you that today's remarks include forward-looking statements and there are number of risks that could cause our future results to differ materially from our expectation.
You can learn more about these risks in the press release that we issued earlier this afternoon and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC. These documents are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.sgi.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
I would now like to pass the call on to Jorge Titinger. Jorge?
Jorge Titinger
Thank you Annie. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. We made solid progress on our strategic priorities during the quarter with one notable exception, the short fall on the top line which I will expand on in a moment. During the quarter, we grew our in-memory HPDA business organically, signed a significant OEM agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and continued to see success with our platform strategy for HPC. We improved our margins, partially paid down our expensive debt and despite lower than expected revenues reduced our breakeven to its lowest point in the last several years. With an increasing contribution from the high growth HPDA business, a more favorable product mix and ongoing operational efficiencies, we achieved profitability on a non-GAAP basis for the second consecutive quarter. The strides we have made to improve our operating and financial model are taking hold.
We experienced a revenue shortfall in the third quarter mainly linked to one of our largest and more consistent federal customers. This customer has been very satisfied with our product performance and service to-dare and as such, we believe we will be successful in winning future business. For the time being, however, the bidding process is delayed. The lower outlook for the federal business together with a push out of two large deals is resulting in a much lower than anticipated Q4 revenue picture and will impact us for the next couple quarters. While some federal spending from the approved budget began during the quarter, most of the funding flow-through has been slower than anticipated to trickle-down due to ongoing participation challenges over specific departmental allocations and recent changes to technical evaluation criteria.

Outside of federal, we furthered our strategy of diversifying our HPC business in life sciences and advanced manufacturing design. We are continuing to pursue large HPC deals to establish incumbency and drive future incremental and repeat business across multiple U.S. government agencies, higher education and research and aerospace. Not only are we adding new HPC customers, but we are also seeing existing customers purchase new products and leverage the unique scalability and performance of our systems by adding compute capacity. One example of this is our ongoing relationship with TOTAL, a platform HPC customer for over a decade. As one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies in the world, TOTAL recently increased their compute power of its SGI Pangea supercomputer by adding i6 capacity to achieve performance of 6.7 petaflops for the equivalent of more than 80,000 laptops combined. The storage capacity of Pangea was also increased to 26 petabytes or the equivalent of six million DVDs. Today Pangea is the number one computer in the oil and gas industry and among the Top 10 most powerful computers worldwide.
In HPDA, the appetite for compute, storage and analytics continues to increase and is laying the foundation for the market to reach new heights. Our UV product line is an excellent solution to address the needs of the high end of this market. This is where we see the greatest potential for exponential penetration, profitability and future growth to set us apart from our peers. As part of our comprehensive effort to ramp our HPDA business and become a leading player in the in-memory market, we are building a variety of direct and indirect sales channels with leading global server companies like Dell and HPE and a number of global system integrators, resellers, cloud and technology providers. These relationships provide significant opportunities in the enterprise, as they enable us to leverage the long-established customer intimacy of our partners. As a result, our SGI branded HPDA pipeline continues to post strong growth and currently stands at nearly $100 million. We remain focused on addressing both on-premise and cloud-based implementations for HANA and we have established relationships with several of the leading providers for hosted HANA solutions. We are seeing strong success with this model and currently have six customers running HANA in the cloud on SGI infrastructure.
Early in the quarter, we announced perhaps the most significant milestone in our emerging in-memory HPDA business. We signed a nonexclusive OEM agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the largest x86 vendor in the world, to exponentially increase our go-to-market capabilities, broaden our SAM and capture a larger share of the A-socket enterprise market. For HPE, our UV product fills out their suite of offerings through this market. HPE has purchased initial systems and trained its sales force and we continue to expect them to ramp and contribute significantly to revenues in fiscal 2017.
Last September, we announced that we have surpassed shipments of 200 terabytes of in-memory HANA appliances to a variety of new and existing customers. As of the third quarter, we have now shipped in excess of 500 terabytes. While still early, the high number of repeat customers we are seeing is validating the value proposition that our solution brings to the enterprise. Based on discussions with industry analysts, we believe we now rank among the top three providers for scale-up HANA appliances in the world measured by terabytes shipped. We are working aggressively to leverage existing HPDA partners and attract new ones to expand our reach into the enterprise. We have the potential to significantly increase engagement and revenue with customers across all. But given the newness of these relationships, particularly with HPE, it is premature to provide specific guidance on the linearity of the ramp.

Despite the delayed spending by federal customers, we are executing well on a number of our strategic priorities. We are diversifying and targeting select HPC vertical markets including life and earth sciences and advanced manufacturing design. We are seeing momentum in our in-memory HPDA product line for the enterprise and have made substantial progress through direct sales, partnerships and reseller agreements. And we are actively focusing on driving operational efficiencies. We believe all of the building blocks are in place for us to achieve future growth and profitability.
Now I will turn the call over to Mack
Mack Asrat
Good afternoon everyone and thank you Jorge. I will start by discussing our third quarter financial performance and then review our outlook. As a reminder, many of the financial measures that I will be discussing are on non-GAAP basis unless otherwise indicated. A full reconciliation to our GAAP financial results is provided in our press release.
For the third quarter, we achieved our profitability objectives for the second consecutive quarter, despite revenue coming in below our expectations. Total revenue was $132 million, 11% higher than the comparable quarter a year ago and 13% lower than last quarter. The year-over-year increase resulted from significant strength we saw in our European operations as well as continued momentum in our HPDA business. The sequential decrease was largely due to delays in federal spending, as Jorge outlined earlier.
Our federal business contributed a very modest $40 million or 30% of total revenue this quarter compared to $56 million or 43% of revenue last quarter. Our non-federal business which includes commercial and international public sector was $92 million this quarter compared to $86 million last quarter and $61 million last year. The strong non-federal results were due to significant growth in Europe including one of our largest customer installations in the earth sciences vertical. We are also very encouraged with the growth in our HPDA business and are on track to achieve our goal of 10% of revenue from UV product line this fiscal year.
Now let me turn to our market sectors. Revenue from the public sector, which includes both U.S. and foreign governments as well as higher education and research, was approximately 44% of total while revenue from the commercial sector was 56%. This compares to a 69/31 split last quarter. Approximately 88% of total revenue came from direct sales, while 12% was driven by systems integrators and other channel partners compared to 84/16 split last quarter. Domestic revenue was 38% in the quarter while international revenue was 62% compared to 52/48 split last quarter.
We had two customers each of which accounted for more than 10% of total revenue this quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29% this quarter, up 170 basis points sequentially. The increase was primarily due to product mix as the UV product line and services accounted for a greater portion of total revenue. In addition, we are being very disciplined with the quality of deals we are targeting and winning to ensure profitable growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $33 million in the quarter, down approximately $2 million from last quarter and $3 million from last year. These improvements reflect our ongoing commitment to continued operational efficiencies and execution. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately $5 million in the third quarter compared with $7 million last quarter and a $1 million operating loss in last year's comparable quarter. Our third quarter results included approximately $2.6 million of depreciation expense.
Despite the lower revenue, we achieved non-GAAP earnings of $0.03 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.14 per share last quarter and a loss of $0.10 per share in last year's third quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings were positive at $0.02 per share and included a $4.4 million gain from the sale of non-core assets.

Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a total cash balance of $103 million versus last quarter's $73 million and generated $27 million of free cash flow. We achieved an 18 day improvement in our cash to cash cycle versus last quarter through focused working capital management. Also to-date, we have paid down a portion of the term loan and secured $7 million of debt in Japan at a much lower rate of approximately 2%. Now our March balance sheet includes $61 million of the term loan and $7 million of new low-cost debt.
Now let me turn to our outlook. Due to the significant impact of the slowdown in our federal business, we are lowering our fourth quarter revenue expectations to at least $120 million. We continue to expect achieve a slight profitability in the fourth quarter with gross margins and operating expenses similar to that of the third quarter. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of at least $530 million and also expect to remain profitable. We believe the slowdown in the federal business is temporary and as a result, we are taking appropriate temporary measures to maintain our cost envelope and continue to apply rigorous deal discipline to ensure profitable growth.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Kurtz with Sterne. Your line is open.
Alex Kurtz
Yes. Thanks. Jorge, can you hear me okay?
Jorge Titinger
I can hear you, Alex.
Alex Kurtz
Hi. Good afternoon. So $70 million comes out of your annual guidance here and I really want to make sure we all understand what happened. Was this book business that's not getting funding? Or is this turns business that you have to go win? Was there more than one or two agencies? Let's start there.
Jorge Titinger
Yes. Sure. So there's two main things in federal and then federal are really two things. One is an agency that has been pretty consistent, close to 10% spender with us for many years and we are basically that is mostly turns business. So there was not necessary backlog of that. And basically it's not coming in. There has been changes in leadership in that agency and with that some redirection of the decision criteria for spending. So that is the biggest portion of the delta. There was one other agency where basically we actually have won the business and their data center is not ready and will not be ready on time to book this quarter. So that one is clearly just a delay. And then we had two international deals that basically were pushed out one to two quarters and then the other three quarters from the whole decision process. So those are the main contributors to the whole delta and frankly we had a bit of a perfect storm in Q4.
Alex Kurtz
So just to clarify that first federal agency that you are talking about would remain missed? Was there a shift in their use of different competitors? And is this agency inside the military intelligence agencies? Or is it outside of that?
Jorge Titinger
Yes. So we have not lost the business to anybody. Like I said earlier, new rejustification of the spending that's been asked by the new leadership and they are looking at when and how to deploy the assets that they need. So we are in the process of trying to understand the new direction, if there is one or if this is truly just a delay. But we have internal coaches, as you can imagine and up until two weeks ago, this was doable inside of the quarter, the portion that's related to that agency. So we are really just trying to get closer to the new team there and understand, is it temporary, is this a permanent change. We are being very conservative in our outlook for this particular customer, not only for Q4, but also for the next quarter until we really have a better picture of what might happen.

Alex Kurtz
Okay. Jorge, just last questions for me. So this customer did not have of funding problem. There was more of a strategic change in how they want to allocate dollars. Is that fair?
Jorge Titinger
Yes. Well, we are not sure if there is a strategic change. What we are hearing is that they are being asked to justify all of their purchases, but from what we can tell, it is not a funding issue.
Alex Kurtz
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Okay. Great. Let's stay on that topic for a little bit. If we look at the guidance going forward, is this issue the only issue that's affecting at the federal government? Are there other agencies that are hesitating? Are there other deals are slipping out in other places?
Jorge Titinger
Yes. So from the last call you remember we guided everybody towards the lower end of our guidance then, right. So we are seeing some delays and we are actually seeing more delays than we expected form this pulling the trigger on that decision. What we are learning is that the whole process of going from through budget to appropriation of actually having that money flow through the different agencies is slower and in many cases more competitive, like who is going to get the money at what time than we had anticipated. This is the only agency where we are also hearing about a potential change in criteria which is why until we understand that we don't know how to account for this as purely for how long a delay from the other agencies. If you remember, the one that didn't have the data center ready, the moment the data center is ready, those tools are going to go get installed and revenued. So at the moment, it's tied to this one agency only.
Mike Kelleher
But there are large sizeable deals that you have seen slip out that you were expecting sooner. Is that true?
Jorge Titinger
Not in federal. Listen, in federal is only the one delay for the data center and then the deals that slipped out were actually two international deals [indiscernible].
Mike Kelleher
Okay. All right. I will get back in the queue. Thanks.
Jorge Titinger
Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Co. Your line is open.
Rich Kugele
Thank you. Good afternoon. Two question from me. What do you mean by criteria, Jorge? Are you talking about the specs of the system? Can you just define criteria?
Jorge Titinger
So we are still trying to understand what that means. Our internal contact there are having to rejustify their systems, where to be deployed, how do we deploy, et cetera. So putting that into a category of potential criteria change. I don't know the specifics right now to actually be able to answer, again with the level of detail that I would like to. But again, this has been a customer of ours for a very long time. They are very happy with the performance of the systems that we ship for years now. And they have been a consistent buyer of our product. So we know it's not dissatisfaction with either technical performance and stability or any of that. We actually get accolades from them on that all the time. And I don't know how much of it is just the change in leadership that is validating what they are going to spend versus other thing that might be part of that.
Rich Kugele
And just as a follow-up to that, do you believe that this is something that gets resolved during the course of the quarter and we can enter the next fiscal year clean? Or do you think you cold linger into the next?
Jorge Titinger
Yes. At the moment we are not counting on revenue from this customer for this quarter and next.
Rich Kugele
Okay. And then Mack, when it comes to the balance sheet, how much did you just explicitly pay off on the debt side? And what are your plans for the rest of the debt?

Mack Asrat
Sure. So as mentioned, we had a $68 million balance at the end of March, $7 million of it is now related to the new loan we got in Japan. So we have been paying little portion of the debt all along. So it's now down to $61 million at end of March. During the quarter, specifically, we actually paid $6 million of that debt of the term loan.
Rich Kugele
Okay. And what's the intention with the rest? Are you going to refinance it? Pay more down?
Mack Asrat
Yes. So we are going to continue to proceed with our current capital strategy, which is paying off the debt and we are looking for opportunities to refinance the balance. We are always looking at also working capital requirements that we have as we look the next few quarters. So we are trying to do the right balancing act. But we are pretty much going to continue to do what we did this quarter, which is continue to chip away at the debt and look for better cost of capital financing elsewhere.
Rich Kugele
Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joan Tong with Sidoti. Your line is open.
Joan Tong
Hi. My questions are regarding the cash flow and then Mack, you mentioned that you are going to look at the working capital need. To be honest, the next couple of quarters, it doesn't look like there will be a whole lot of growth because of this particular situation you have here. Why do we need really working capital to support growth when there is none? And then why won't you give us a definitive answer in terms of paying down the debt?
Mack Asrat
Sure. So Joan, the working capital requirements typically initiate several quarters before the deals actually revenue. So we have a pretty healthy pipeline of both large deals in HPC as well as pretty fair healthy opportunities in HPDA side. So it's not just the next quarter or two, we are actually looking out beyond that to see what our working capital requirements are. So as soon as we are able to say more on that, we will provide more information. But we are looking at the pretty healthy growth as we look out several quarters, not just the next quarter or two.
Joan Tong
Thank you.
Mack Asrat
Sure.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers
Yes. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about first of all what you are seeing in the competitive landscape? And on that topic, this last week or so we saw an announcement out of IBM about Halliburton taking some HPC workloads into the cloud. I am just curious if what you are seeing, are customers asking you about cloud? Do you see cloud as a competitive dynamic in HPC? And then I do have a follow-up.
Jorge Titinger
Sure. So yes, thanks for the question. Certainly the number of conversations about deployment in the cloud has been increasing. And so we see, as an inevitable path to some HPC jobs will be running in the cloud. Now I don't think this is standard low-end cloud, right. So there will be deployments of HPC hardware, HPC connectivity, et cetera, that are offered in a cloud environments, business clouds where essentially the customers will rent instead of buy. So we definitely see that chatter increase. For example, in our HPDA business, it's not quite HPC but fairly similar, we are we are deploying a fair number systems in cloud environments already. And for a lot of our customers today, the way they deploy our systems is in private cloud environment. So we have in the past talked about NASA Ames really running their large computer in cloud environments. So no question, I think there is going to be more and more that goes to the cloud, especially some of the jobs that require fewer nodes to actually run the job. So we definitely see that. And one of our key strategic areas of focus for the near future is cloud. So we that agree with you there. While we are not seeing it necessarily folks are running, they are very small, thousands and thousands of users, very small thousands of jobs in low end hardware clouds really bidding for HPC deals.

Aaron Rakers
Okay. And then I am just curious, when we look at your obviously positive your relationship with HPE, I am just curious of how we how we should think about the trajectory of that going out over the next couple of quarters, even if you can talk about any of the way of the training, everything else that's involved in moving that relationship forward and when that becomes material to your overall revenue?
Jorge Titinger
Sure. So as you know, we signed, I don't remember exactly, but about six weeks ago, the actual agreement that they, HPE train, I am just going to say, over 100 times more salespeople than we have, right. So it's a significant increase on feet on the street selling this solution. We have said before and we continue to believe that with them the total revenue for the UV product line will double next year. So it's a very significant contribution from that agreement. The thing that we don't know yet which is why I said earlier, it's a little too early to talk about the timing of the ramp, whether it's pretty linear quarter-to-quarter or whether it would be a little more backend loaded, we will know a lot more as we start working more closely with HPE. But we have had initial revenue, which we frankly we are accounting this fiscal year. But we see them as a significant contributor for the HPDA business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.
Aaron Rakers
Okay. And then a final quick question would be, when you look at one of the opportunities that seems to exist out there in the market of HPC, looking at the IBM install base, where do you stand on currently, seeing those opportunities present themselves in terms of projects and bids et cetera, in particular on the Blue Gene side of whether you are seeing some of those opportunities themselves up?
Jorge Titinger
Yes. So there's two types of opportunities with IBM, basically stepping out of the normal market, if you will. They are still very, very good in the real high-end. And so we are actually winning a number of ex-iDataPlex customers. And that is fairly standard cluster business for us and it's pretty much open to many, many of the people we compete with. And we have won a fair number of those. With Blue Gene specifically, we are in conversations with a number of the Blue Gene current users who are looking to upgrade or move on to the next solution as the opportunity to actually move on to the next computer comes around and we have a number of potential Blue Gene replacement deals in our pipeline. We have not yet seen a Blue Gene replacements to-date. So they are all out some in fiscal 2017 and some little beyond fiscal 2017. We believe we are well-positioned with the ICE X product to be able to deliver the topology and the performance that Blue Gene users need.
Aaron Rakers
Great. Thank you very much.
Jorge Titinger
Thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with Sterne. Your line is open.
Alex Kurtz
Yes. Jorge, just a quick follow-up for me. When it comes to OmniPath, how does it not look, not really interested about how you have executed on it in Q1 or Q2, but when you think about the end of the year as far as your part of your pipeline, how do you think that's going to trend as we look to Q3 and Q4 as far as customers looking to OmniPath as a potential interconnect choice in your cluster business?
Jorge Titinger
Good question. What we are seeing today is, at least from the customers that we are talking to, there is fair amount of interest for OmniPath 2 that is yet out in the market. OmniPath 1, we are not seeing a lot of differentiation between what anyone can do today in OmniPath 1. So we have a little bit of interest, people who want to check it out and see how it works. But the bulk of the interest is really on the next generation OmniPath. So I don't know if I have detail, as far as particularly the next couple of quarters of how our pipeline looks [indiscernible] OmniPath.

Alex Kurtz
Okay. Well, maybe that's setting up a follow-up a couple of quarters from now. Thanks Jorge.
Jorge Titinger
Yes. We will look into that specifically, so we can answer in more detail.
Alex Kurtz
Okay. Jorge, just a follow-up then, if you guys did have customers adopt OmniPath, does that mean there is more dollars for you potentially in a deal? What's the economic impact for SGI?
Jorge Titinger
The answer is, it depends, right. It depends on whether, because as you know, Alex, these procurements are not necessarily on a fixed price, right and so we think that having just the competitive environment between InfiniBand and OmniPath will provide an opportunity to lower the cost of the total solution, right. But if everybody is offering the same thing and it gets down to price competition, much of the savings will potentially end up being passed to the customers and it will depend on each deal how much of a delta the equipment provider will be able to keep. But it definitely having more than one solution, we think, is definitely a good deal for the industry and for us.
Alex Kurtz
All right. Thanks Jorge.
Jorge Titinger
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We have a follow-up from the line of Joan Tong with Sidoti. Your line is open.
Joan Tong
Thank you all. My question is related to, again, on the federal side. Just we saw the budget details came out regarding the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the NSCI,
the Obama Executive Order. It seems like directionally, the number is looking really decent. I am just wondering how we should take that into 2017 number? I know it's still early, but you talk about federal is being weak, things got pushed out. None of those get lot, so I am just wondering, is there any read into how we should think about fiscal 2017?
Jorge Titinger
Yes. So Joan, we are not giving 2017 guidance yet but we definitely see growth in 2017, in a number of areas, right. And one of the, see the timing of NSCI isn't immediate. There is a lot of discussions. There is a lot of definitional work that's going on which we are a big part of. Those discussions, we are part of the group that's actually looking at that. There has been an expansion of the focus, not just for compute hardware, it isn't just about excess scale computing, but also being able to analyze exabytes of data. So there is now more of a balanced solution that's being look forward to actually we think plays well to our portfolio, our cluster solutions and our shared memory solutions. But it is a multiyear initiative where I think 2017, at least our fiscal 2017 will be very beginning of NSCI deployments. But we do see growth in our verticals. We see growth in HPC verticals. I mean. We see growth in our HPDA business and we will continue to focus on the operational efficiencies that we drive on an ongoing basis to make sure that the growth and we see is profitable growth.
Joan Tong
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jorge Titinger
I want to thanks everybody for joining us today and look forward to continuing to chat with you in the near future. Bye, bye.

Jorge Titinger returned Silicon Graphics International to profitability

By:  |  4:00pm EDT September 30, 2013 





Jorge Titinger’s first day as president and CEO of technical computing leader, Silicon Graphics International Corp. was Feb. 27, 2012 — and the next day, instead of having time to ease into his new role, he was telling investors about the company’s shortcomings the quarter before.
“There were a lot of questions about the direction of the company, why the miss happened and why it was not visible to the prior leadership team,” Titinger says.
What happened the prior quarter, was that the company reiterated guidance in early December 2011. The then CEO left in mid-December and the chairman of the board stepped in as acting CEO. By the time the books were closed and the earnings were announced, the company did not meet guidance.
“Even though it was reiterated less than a month before the end of the quarter, the actual results were worse, from an earnings perspective, than had been expected,” Titinger says. “That coupled with the departure of the leadership produced some significant concerns in the investment community.”
While Titinger was new to his CEO role, he wasn’t unfamiliar with SGI. He had worked for the company, which delivers high performance computing, server, storage, data center, cloud computing solutions and professional services, a few decades prior and had a good grasp of the organization.
“I had the luxury of being able to do a pretty detailed due diligence before joining, so I had some level of understanding of what needed to be done,” Titinger says of the more than 1,400-employee, $753 million company. “I was able to focus on talking to the investment community about what changes were necessary to get the company back on the right track.”
Following the investor conference, Titinger had to develop a plan to move SGI forward.
“It was a great way to come into the company by facing the folks that I need to keep talking to in the future,” Titinger says. “While it was a little adversarial because the results that the company had achieved the prior quarter were not what they were expecting, these are people who want to see what we are planning on doing, how we are turning things around, and they’ll be cheering for us. That’s how I approached it.”
Here’s how Titinger came into a struggling SGI and got the company on the right track.
 
Find what needs fixing
To better understand why the company wasn’t performing up to snuff the quarter before Titinger’s arrival, he spent the first several weeks and months diagnosing issues that needed to be fixed.
“I spent a lot of time traveling, meeting with customers, meeting with suppliers, and meeting with the different groups inside the company to get more clarity on the cause and effect of the issues we had to fix,” Titinger says.
After coming into the company, he realized there were certain business practices missing. Without those practices in place, it wasn’t a surprise that the results were unknown.
One of his commitments to SGI’s board of directors was to develop a strategic plan within three months that would guide the company down the path it needed to follow.
“The diagnosis involved a number of areas: How good are our products in the markets that we’re competing in?” he says. “How good are our processes? Is our strategy the right strategy? Are there relationships with customers at the right level? And lastly, is our team the right team?
“I had spent the early part of my tenure here making sure we had clarity in those areas and where to develop action.”
A lot of the initial focus that Titinger had in the turnaround was putting those business practices in place.
“My diagnosis of the business was that there was a misalignment between structure of incentives and the objectives that the company had, especially with the sales force that was incented on bookings only, and we were too complex for the size that we were,” Titinger says.
“SGI today is a combination of the old SGI and Rackable Systems Inc., and the combined company is still quite a bit smaller than the old SGI used to be, but many of the business practices and processes were from a much larger, complicated company.
“So we have spent a lot of time in this past year simplifying what we offer to the customers, refocusing on certain vertical markets instead of trying to be everything for everybody,” he says.
“The essence of the plan is focus, simplify, be able to deliver more value to a narrowed set of customers, and then clean up the internal processes to make sure we don’t get in our own way when we’re working on behalf of fixing customers’ problems.”
The No. 1 thing that helped Titinger identify SGI’s trouble areas was his ability to listen.
“The tendency to come in with prefabbed solutions will be high,” he says. “Anybody who’s gotten to the CEO level has had lots of successes and there’s a danger in thinking every problem can be solved the same way. I would caution people to not just start applying your tool set into the situation, but spend time listening and keep an open mind so you learn what is relevant in this particular situation.”
 
Take the next steps
The next step, after identifying issues in the business that needed fixing, was to focus on three things.
“One was to set the strategy,” Titinger says. “I view this as a key role for the CEO. You’ve got to set the strategy. You’ve got to drive the culture in the company that will be able to execute that strategy, and then you have to have the right team in place.
“My next steps were exactly down that path. Who are we going to be and what are we going to do? We had to shift the mood from despair to a can-do attitude. That was buried in the company a little bit, so we had to make that come back up. And then we had to strengthen the team significantly given the task we had to go fix.”
Titinger had spent a lot of time talking to customers and employees who served customers — so that’s where the strategy focused.
“If the strategy doesn’t start with the customer, chances are you’re going to have a hard time with market relevance,” he says. “Based on those conversations and that analysis, the focus was where we can differentiate and provide value-added solutions to customers.
“We then mapped our markets from the perspective of where we could bring differentiated value, but at the same time, determine if they were markets that had growth and where we thought we could succeed. We then narrowed down the market focus and narrowed down the product offerings to support those markets.”
Titinger made sure he involved not only the executive team, but people deeper in the organization who needed to execute this strategy during the development process in order to make it successful.
“Strategy serves two purposes — No. 1 is for the company to understand how it can bring differentiated value,” he says. “Everything the company does has to support achieving that. Equally important is what you’re going to stop doing so you can dedicate your resources to those things that you need to do really, really well.”
One of the biggest problems companies may have is saying no to things that either have been going on in the past or are great ideas, but are ones that don’t add value to customers.
“That is the hardest part in the strategy when you’re figuring out what not to do,” Titinger says. “It comes back to the customer. You can have a great strategy that looks great internally, but if it’s not interesting to your customers, it’s going to be irrelevant.”
 
Deliver on the strategy
With an internal goal of three months to deliver a strategy to the board of directors, Titinger started in March 2012 and in May presented the strategy. Endorsed by the board, the strategy was presented to investors in June.
“The strategy in the end really had three pillars,” Titinger says. “No. 1 was simplification of our focus on vertical markets and product offerings. No. 2 was a shift from an infrastructure provider to being a solution provider as a company, and No. 3 was operational excellence to improve those processes that were not necessarily the right ones.”
Today, SGI is right on track with the strategy and ahead of plans on the operational elements, spot-on with the simplification elements, and making the kind of progress Titinger wanted to make.
“Given that we’re on track and maybe slightly ahead on the execution of the plan, my assessment of the company is that we have done very well,” he says. “We have turned the company back to profitability within two quarters. We’ve gone from thinking we needed to raise cash to actually generating cash.
“We have a much more focused product roadmap that addresses market needs. We’ve improved the quality and capability of the senior team and that has long-term positive effects for the future of the company.”
With the new strategy in place, SGI employees are enthusiastic and see a path to success.
“I’m excited about the possibilities the company has to add value to our customers,” Titinger says. “I want our investors to view us as one of their best investments, our customers to view us essential to their success, and I want our employees to view SGI as the best place they can be.” ●

The Titinger File
Name: Jorge Titinger
Title: President and CEO
Company: Silicon Graphics International Corp.
 
Born: Lima, Peru
 
Education: He has a bachelor’s and master’s degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree in engineering management from Stanford.
 
What was your first job, and what did you take away from that experience?
I’m in high-tech by accident. I came to Stanford and studied electrical engineering. I played for the soccer team all four years and played in the North American Soccer League after college. Then the league went bankrupt in 1985 and that’s when I went back to school. I also played soccer on the U.S. Indoor National team from 1988 to 1993.
That was a tremendously fun time. I learned a lot from the world of sports that is relevant to the world of business such as teamwork and feedback. The early parts of my career were divided between running around chasing a ball and going to the office.
 
What position did you play in soccer?
I played center forward.
 
Do you still play?
Yes. I have a saying, ‘The older I get, the better I was.’
 
Do you have a favorite player?
In my office I have a picture of Pele, but today I think Leo Messi is out of this world.
 
What is the best business advice you’ve ever received?
I had a mentor who used to say, ‘Mood is everything; the rest is just details.’ I find that to be incredibly relevant. The other piece of advice is that there is no substitute for hard work.
 
Who do you admire in business?
I started my career at HP and I have studied the path that both Hewlett and Packard took. Those two are people to learn from and admire. They were relentless about driving profitability and doing it by adding value to customers. For me that has always been a guiding principle.
