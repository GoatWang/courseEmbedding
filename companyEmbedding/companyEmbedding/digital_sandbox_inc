Haystax Technology Acquires Digital Sandbox, Inc.
Expands Product Technology Offering in Law Enforcement and Security Markets
















































SAN JOSE, Calif., April 16, 2013 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Haystax Technology, Inc. (Haystax), a portfolio company of the Edgewater Funds, today announced the acquisition of Digital Sandbox, Inc. Haystax provides multi-source information integration, big data analytics and visualization to address the challenges posed by exponential increases in data volume to customers in the intelligence, defense and security communities.

Digital Sandbox is a software company that has been providing threat and risk analysis and monitoring software in the National Security and Homeland Security fields since 1998.

Digital Sandbox's suite of secure and cloud-deployable software tools provide geospatial, temporal, and real-time streaming information feeds to monitor threats and risks for field operations and special events, including four of the last five Super Bowls.
William Van Vleet, Chief Executive Officer of Haystax, said, "The accelerating variety, volume and velocity of data available can overwhelm organizations and leaders responsible for ensuring the safety of major companies and events. We are excited to add Digital Sandbox's technologies to provide our customers with scalable analytics to monitor hundreds of real-time news and social media feeds with mobile solutions to enable entirely new capabilities for prioritized, intelligent decision-making."
Digital Sandbox founders and partners, Bryan Ware and Anthony Beverina, added, "Together, as part of one company, we become a more powerful platform with access to defense and intelligence markets. We are now positioned to compete for opportunities that were, until now, beyond the capabilities of either company alone. We are very excited to join Haystax to raise the level of our service and capabilities for our customers."
Following the acquisition, Digital Sandbox will be known as Digital Sandbox, Inc., a Haystax Company, and will continue to be led by its president, Anthony Beverina. Bryan Ware will serve as the chief technology officer for Haystax Technology. The terms of the transaction were not released.

			MovinHouz
		








(?)






















MovinHouz brings a new experience to the moving industry.  Using the MovinHouz mobile app, customers can Click It…Pic It…Move!  MovinHouz movees (Customers who are moving), with a few picks and a few clicks, can set up their move with thoroughly vetted movers.  All of this takes the stress out of picking a mover and ensures the safety and security of all your belongings.
Currently movees have a very difficult time finding a quality mover.  Today, if someone needs to move, they have to ask around for the best moving company or go online where their information will be sold, resulting in continuous phone calls.  Then, the movee has to make sure that they are being contacted by professionally insured moving companies.  Finally, the movee has to take extra time to meet with multiple moving companies to properly price their moves which could still fluctuate thoughout the move.
MovinHouz’s, MovinPic Technology, ensures that that the moving process is seamless.  MovinPic allows the movee to upload photos of each room and major items.  These photos will be seen by multiple vetted movers who will then each submit a moving quote.  MovinPic enables clear identification of the items to be moved and allows the moving company to see the actual items involved so they can provide the most accurate quote possible.
This creates a win-win for both the movee and the mover.

			Windsor Trucking Solutions
		








(?)






















Windsor Trucking Solutions creates SaaS compliance solutions for the trucking industry. Their IFTA Plus product is an online quarterly fuel tax preparation site that makes it fast and easy for truckers to prepare International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) returns.
Owner operators and small fleets make up the vast majority of the 1.2 million trucking companies in the United States. However, they are greatly underserved with accessible and simple to use solutions in order to remain compliant with state and federal regulations. Many of the solutions available today are made for large fleets, are not user-friendly and are not affordable for the trucker.
IFTA Plus automatically calculates taxes owed or the amount a company will be credited. The solution automatically fills in actual state forms so the company/trucker needs only to sign and send. A mobile app tied into the SaaS solution is scheduled to launch in the next few weeks.
“I’m extremely excited to be part of Digital Sandbox,” said Jason Read, CEO of Windsor Trucking Solutions. “The funding is key for the development of our Partner Integration Platform, which is foundational to the company’s growth and the continuing integration demands from partner organizations.”

(?)































			PreScreend
		








(?)






















PreScreend is a predictive analytics platform that provides businesses and consumers a way to authenticate and verify someone’s real identity. Big data is also used to identify criminal methods and create behavioral DNA, allowing for identification based on how a person acts, rather than their genetic make-up.
PreScreend's first party consent based model provides users with a proactive layer of personal safety and security. In an on-demand economy people get into cars with complete strangers, trust freelancers with proprietary technology secrets, and sleep in the beds of people they've never met. PreScreend's platform searches over a billion data points, and helps you stay safe before meeting strangers for the first time.
The company was founded by local and federal law enforcement professionals who have seen first-hand the need for safer interactions between strangers.
"In law enforcement, we always find ourselves being reactive when someone becomes the victim of a crime,” said Dustin Abercrombie, founder and CEO. “PreScreend will finally provide people with a way to be proactive with their personal safety. This opportunity allows for us to expand our technology infrastructure and automation capabilities while reducing the number of victims exponentially."









(?)











































(?)































			B2G Data
		








(?)






















B2G Data addresses the issue of nursing retention through a mobile app that allows nurses to record activities, earn points for those activities and then redeem those points for incentives such as paid time off, gift cards, raffles and catalog items.
Hospital reimbursement for services is increasingly being tied to care quality. Staffing shortages and temporary staffing can lead to a decrease in overall care quality and patient satisfaction. Hospitals can improve their financial bottom line by focusing on nurse retention, using B2G Data’s Tak mobile app. Tak means “thank you” in Danish.
The initial target audience for the product is hospitals. B2G Data has launched a single location version of the app and plans to launch a multi-location app before the end of the year. 
“We are very excited that Digital Sandbox KC has given their endorsement to our nurse retention app with both encouragement and finances,” said Gary Abram, DEO of B2G Data. “Digital Sandbox KC's support will allow us to expand the app's ability to work with multiple clients at once.” 









(?)











































(?)































			Agreeable
		








(?)






















The Agreeable Company is developing a mobile app (Agreeable) that allows individuals planning meetings (especially those with strangers such as through Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist) to do so in a safer and more reliable manner. The in-app messaging and agreements function allows both parties to work out details, including a no-show fee.
One setting particularly dense with no-shows is online classifieds, with more than a billion ads posted annual. Initial target customers are grouped by frequency of online classifieds use, including super sellers (buy or sell weekly); smart shoppers (buy or sell monthly); and spring cleaners (casual users of online classifieds). 
The app not only allows for meeting details to be set with both parties, but the app also detects whether either party is present at the time of the meeting using the users’ phone location technology. The app then automatically compensates the user when there is a no show. Additional features include a rating system on users and suggested safe meeting locations.
“We’re excited to have been selected for Digital Sandbox KC,” said Ian Hoffman, co-founder and CEO. “It’s great to see others believe in our vision as much as we do, and this will allow Agreeable to grow our website features, giving our customers a more comfortable and full-featured tool for their meetings.”









(?)











































(?)































			Tapyness
		








(?)






















Tapyness is a one question, three button survey presented in a discrete location near an exit that provides consumers an easy way to report on their experience, in context. The results give business owners immediate and actionable insight.
Many small and medium size businesses are not receiving quality data on their customers’ experiences. Large organizations struggle to find “regular” customers willing to participate in long post-experience satisfaction surveys. Businesses need a way to get quick feedback in the manner in which customers consume their content – variable likes, retweets and pins.
Tapyness solves the issue of easy feedback for consumers. A tablet positioned near the exit of a retail establishment asks “How was your overall experience today?” Underneath are three responses (images/ text) from which the customer may choose or “tap:” thumbs up, thumbs middle, thumbs down. A reporting portal and dashboard service provided to the business allows the owner to see aggregate results by day and time ranges.  Further development will allow Tapyness to aggregate Facebook likes/ comments and Yelp stars/ comments to be displayed alongside results of the exit poll.
The initial target audience is small to medium size retail businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, fashion outlets, auto services, grocery stores and professional/ medical offices.

			Routine Success
		








(?)






















Routine Success allows parents of children with ADHD and autism spectrum disorders to easily build digital routines to assist their children throughout the day. Routines are delivered to the child through a discreet, watch-form-factor wearable that minimizes the need for expensive and conspicuous hardware.
Many children with neurological conditions such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) thrive when they establish and follow predictable, repeatable routines. Step-by-step routines that are successful in a controlled environment like the home, where parents are closely monitoring behavior, become more difficult in a classroom.
Routine Success is an app for the Pebble smartwatch that allows parents to build easy-to-follow “routines” for a child through a user-friendly website. The child receives an alert at pre-determined times via a discreet vibration and is prompted to complete the appropriate steps. The routines are completely customizable to meet the child’s unique schedule. At the end of the day, parents can sync the watch with a smartphone and see how the child responded to the routines.









(?)











































(?)































			Flokk
		








(?)






















Flokk is a social event platform that connects people to great event experiences and rewards, while also analyzing pertinent data and content to connect event organizers to sponsors. The platform offers proximity-based promotions, automatic checks, real-time analytics as the event is happening and a customer loyalty program.
Many events only engage with their customers on a limited basis, usually during a transaction like buying a ticket, food or memorabilia. An event’s success can only be measured by the number of attendees.
Flokk’s social networking platform creates flexibility to interact with attendees in real time and allows event organizers to manage public/private offerings to select individuals. The platform provides information about attendees’ trends so that more effective promotions can be offered. For the event crowd, Flokk provides visual metrics to gauge event crowd, identify friends attending and events that are trending.
The product’s target market is companies that manage large entertainment venues and event promotion companies. Additionally, Flokk is targeting people ages 18-44 who attend events and use social media.

Digital Sandbox is a software company that has been providing threat and risk analysis and monitoring software in the National Security and Homeland Security fields since 1998.  Federal, State, and Local agencies use Digital Sandbox commercial software product suites to quantify and monitor risks from natural and man-made threats, and to direct resources based on threat and risk priorities. Digital Sandbox’s suite of secure and cloud-deployable software tools provide geospatial, temporal, and real-time streaming information feeds to monitor threats and risks for field operations and special events, including four of the last five Super Bowls. William B. Van Vleet, Chief Executive Officer of Haystax, said, “The accelerating variety, volume and velocity of data available can overwhelm organizations and leaders responsible for ensuring the safety of major companies and events.  We are excited to add Digital Sandbox’s technologies to provide our customers with scalable analytics to monitor hundreds of real-time news and social media feeds with mobile solutions to enable entirely new capabilities for prioritized, intelligent decision-making.” Digital Sandbox founders and partners, Bryan Ware and Anthony Beverina, added, “Together, as part of one company, we become a more powerful platform with access to defense and intelligence markets. We are now positioned to compet2e for opportunities that were, until now, beyond the capabilities of either company alone.  We are very excited to join Haystax to raise the level of our service and capabilities for our customers.” Following the acquisition, Digital Sandbox will be known as Digital Sandbox, Inc., a Haystax Company, and will continue to be led by its president, Anthony Beverina.  Bryan Ware will serve as the chief technology officer for Haystax Technology.  The terms of the transaction were not released.
