This book contains the genealogy and some brief stories about my ancestors who traveled the Mormon Trail and settled in Utah in the 1800's.  This book includes prominent Reynolds, Hamblin, Bullock, Adair, McIntyre, Richey, Jarvis, Clayton, and McAllister pioneer lines.  For most of these lines, the time period between when they joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints and when they immigrated to Utah are covered.  However, the Reynolds and Hamblin lines are covered down through my father's grandparents.  Some more famous ancestors covered in the book are Thomas Bullock, Samuel Jefferson Adair, and Isaiah Hamblin.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

About Us

Two of the most trusted household brands, Reynolds® and Hefty®, joined together as Reynolds Consumer Products in 2010. While the establishment of this new company made it official, the truth is that Reynolds® and Hefty® products have been found side-by-side in the kitchens of American families for more than three generations.The creation of both the Reynolds® and Hefty® brands is the direct result of American ingenuity mixed with a bit of elbow grease. Reynolds Wrap® foil was invented after aluminum was no longer needed for military use; and became a new staple for American kitchens. Hefty® waste bags were first developed with excess material from an early plastics innovator, creating another household essential.

Music puts Imagine Dragons’ brother “on top of the world”

Arrow, Aja, Dan, and Coulter Reynolds visit Oregon in August of 2014. Dan Reynolds’ band, Imagine Dragons, rose to fame while little brother Coulter served his mission in El Salvador. Coulter Reynolds is now studying communications at BYU. (Photo courtesy Coulter Reynolds)
Two years ago in El Salvador, BYU student Coulter Reynolds heard an Imagine Dragons song on the radio at a local Wendy’s. He was serving a mission at the time and figured his zone leader, who shared his hometown of Las Vegas, was playing a trick on him. There was no way that Imagine Dragons, an up-and-coming band headed by his older brother, Dan Reynolds, would be playing on the radio — especially in El Salvador.
It turns out his zone leader wasn’t playing a trick at all. Coulter’s parents, friends and siblings had been keeping a big secret. Imagine Dragons had recently hit it big in the United States — so big it was headed to the Grammys later that year.
Little brother Coulter was “extremely proud,” but success and family support are nothing new for the Reynolds family.
When asked to describe the Reynolds family, Coulter’s longtime best friend, Jason Bedford, had one word: successful.
“Because both of their parents are really smart and have such strong moral values, they were naturally successful,” said Bedford, a sophomore at UVU studying biology. “(Their) mom was really into them playing piano too, because she always believed that it helped with the brain and helped them with their studies and whatnot.”
All nine of the Reynolds kids were required to take “at least” piano until age 16, Coulter said.
His sister, Sarah Bleazard, who graduates in December with a degree in elementary education, explained that while not all of the Reynolds children aspired to be musicians, they never wanted to give up music as a hobby. According to Bleazard, at one point or another they all played in bands, thanks to their mom. Their good taste in music comes from their dad, but their overall success is a family business.
“I am super lucky,” Bleazard said. “I’m not trying to brag, but I was born into a family that is constantly supportive. They thrive off of helping someone; they thrive off helping the sibling’s success.”
Bleazard said when Dan comes on the radio, her mom, Christene Reynolds, is the first to say, “That’s my son!”
But her support isn’t just for her famous children.
Older brother Dr. Brandon Reynolds returned to hometown Las Vegas to open a plastic surgery practice a few years before Imagine Dragons took off. Christene headed straight to a local mall to spread news about her son. Business cards in hand, she approached each kiosk in the mall. She would agree to try vendors’ products if they would agree to listen to her spiel on her product — her son.
Bleazard said the eight Reynolds brothers have inherited the supportive gene.
“If Coulter said, ‘I really love donuts,’ and that’s what he wanted to do, my brothers would be the first one to fund him and tell everyone he has the best donuts,” Bleazard said.

For now, donuts are not in Coulter’s future. Music, success and family are, however.
Following the footsteps of three of his seven older brothers, Coulter, a sophomore studying public relations and double-minoring in Spanish and logic, hopes to attend law school. He plans to later manage bands in Las Vegas under his father’s law firm. The four other Reynolds brothers attended medical school and currently practice in Las Vegas. Even Bleazard now resides in Las Vegas, working a desk job for her brother while finishing her BYU degree online.
Before he heads to law school, Coulter will spend his summer with his brother following Imagine Dragons on its North American tour. Dan, whom he described as his confidante and best friend, invited him as soon as he returned home from his mission.
“I feel like a little kid that gets Christmas over and over again every day,” Coulter said. “I’d say you’d find me front row, but there won’t be much room there, so you’ll probably find me wherever there is space enough to dance and shake my booty.”
Coulter said his parents, now in their mid-60s, attend every show they can make it to.
“(Mom) will be right there singing and dancing to all the words, and if (Mom and Dad) don’t go, the next day they watch the entire show together,” he said.
From basement bands to law school and the Grammys, one thing is certain: the Reynolds family is the star of the show when it comes to supporting each other’s success.

Reynolds American, Inc. (NYSE: RAI) is an American tobacco company and is the second-largest tobacco company in the United States.[4] Its holdings include R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, American Snuff Company (formerly Conwood Company), Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company and Niconovum AB.
Reynolds American's subsidiaries manufacture and market a variety of tobacco products, including cigarettes (Newport, Camel, Pall Mall, Kent, Doral, Misty, Capri and Natural American Spirit brands) and moist snuff (Grizzly and Kodiak brands).[5]
In 2010, Reynolds American's operating companies sold about 28% of all cigarettes sold in the U.S.[6]
In July 2014, Reynolds American announced the purchase of Lorillard Tobacco Company in a deal valued at $27 billion.
In January 2017, Reynolds American agreed to be purchased by British American Tobacco for $49.4 billion.[7]
History[edit]
Reynolds American was formed in January 2004[8] and began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange as RAI in August 2004.[5]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share of RAI.[8] Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, which manufactures the additive-free Natural American Spirit brand of tobacco products, also became a subsidiary of Reynolds American at that time.[8]
Prior to becoming RAI operating companies, both R. J. Reynolds and Santa Fe were part of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., which traded on the New York Stock Exchange as RJR. RJR became a subsidiary of RAI in July 2004.[8] R. J. Reynolds was established as a tobacco company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1875.[9]
In 2006, Reynolds American expanded into the smokeless tobacco category, with the acquisition of Conwood, the second-biggest smokeless tobacco company in the United States. Conwood manufactures and markets moist and dry snuff, loose leaf, plug and twist chewing tobaccos. At the time of the acquisition, 70% of Conwood's sales came from the growing moist-snuff segment, with the Grizzly brand showing the fastest growth.[10] Grizzly's continued growth since 2006 has made it the best-selling brand in the moist-snuff category.[11]
In 2008, RAI was recognized as a leader in corporate sustainability by being added to the membership in the 2008-2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (DJSI North American). RAI is the only U.S. tobacco company and one of 125 North American companies on the index.[12] Selection for the Index is based on performance in a number of economic, environmental and social criteria.[13]
The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2009 that Reynolds American intended to buy Sweden-based Niconovum AB, a maker of products such as nicotine gum, for $44.5 million.[14] The deal was completed in December.[15]
Former Chairman, President and CEO of Reynolds Tobacco Daniel "Daan" Delen assumed the positions of President and CEO of Reynolds American on March 1, 2011,[16] after former president, CEO and chairwoman Susan Ivey announced she would retire as chairwoman November 1, 2010 and as President and CEO effective February 28, 2011.[17]
Ivey, now known as Susan Cameron, returned as CEO in April 2014 after being elected by the board of directors.[18]
In July 2014, Reynolds American, Inc. announced it would buy Lorillard Tobacco Company for roughly $25 billion a result of slowed sales. The deal is valued at $27.4 billion, including debt.[19][20] Reynolds agreed to pay $68.88 in cash and stock for every Lorillard share and assume its debt.[21] The deal also included the sale of the Kool, Winston, Salem, and blu brands to Imperial for $7.1 billion.[22] The merger became official on June 12, 2015.[23]
A legal notice filed July 29, 2015 said that Reynolds must get a county permit to make Newports at its Tobaccoville plant, so for 18 months Imperial will make Newports and Reynolds will make three brands it sold.[24]
On September 15, 2016, the former speaker of the US House, John Boehner, joined the board of Reynolds American.[25]
On October 21, 2016, British American Tobacco announced that it had offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of Reynolds American for $47 billion.[26] In January 2017, Reynolds American agreed to a $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[7]
