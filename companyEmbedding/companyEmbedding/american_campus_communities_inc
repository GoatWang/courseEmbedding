Where students love living.®



It's not just our company tagline. It's how we run our business every single day.

We believe every student should love where they live. That’s why our number one priority is delivering the best possible experience for students — at every price point. It’s the goal we continually strive for, and the mantra that shapes our values as an organization.




See our values




Built from the ground up.






We understand the student experience because student housing is all we do.




In 1984 our CEO Bill Bayless began his career as a Resident Assistant and found his passion in life: helping students succeed. He turned that passion for student success into the company he runs today. It's a passion we all share. In fact, most of the management team first joined the company as students working at ACC communities.

Steve Beinke
SVP, Tax

Steve Beinke
SVP, Tax
Texas A&M University
B.B.A. Accounting
M.S. Accounting 

First student housing experience: Typical no-frills freshman residence hall. Callaway House was still under construction back then!

Most memorable college experience: That's easy - walking across the stage at Reed Arena with two degrees in hand and zero college debt. 

Favorite thing about college: A&M's rich traditions and the friendships and bonds created with fellow Aggies that last to this day. 

Something most people don't know: I grew up an air force brat and lived in Fairbanks, Alaska for five years. Many years, and many sweltering summers later, I'll still take the Texas heat over brutal Fairbanks winters any day. 

Favorite college-themed movie: Rudy 
As a key member of ACC’s tax function, Steve oversees the planning, organization and implementation of all tax initiatives at American Campus Communities.  In addition to ensuring ACC’s compliance with all REIT tax laws and regulations, and directing the tax due diligence performed in connection with various transactions, he is charged with implementing tax optimization strategies for federal, state, and local tax filings, and drives tax reduction efforts by assessing the company’s current tax strategies and exploring and implementing new tax opportunities.  From an operations perspective, Steve also oversees ACC’s property tax function for its 30 plus state portfolio to ensure that financial results are optimized for investors.
 
Steve’s history with ACC goes back more than ten years to when, as a tax professional in Deloitte’s Houston office, he first prepared the company’s 2005 income tax returns.  Upon ACC’s booming growth in the few years that followed, culminating with the public merger with GMH in 2008, Steve joined ACC full time in 2009.  Prior to joining ACC, Steve spent eight and a half years with Deloitte Tax LLP’s Houston office, where he primarily served REITs and private real estate clients.           
 
Steve is a licensed CPA and active board member of the Boys & Girls Club of Georgetown.  
 



Clint Braun
SVP, Development & Project Management, P3

Clint Braun
SVP, Development & Project Management, P3

Texas A&M University
B.S., Construction Science
 
First student housing experience: Suite-style athletic dorm. There were lots of activities and not much sleep! ACC later built a new res hall right next to the old dorm.
 
Favorite thing about college: I was the first in my family to graduate college, while working full time (finished in 4.5 years). Also, A&M beat UT every year that I was in school. Whoop!
Clint is responsible for development and project management within our P3 (public private partnership) division. His role includes the oversight of all pre-development and development activities, including design, scheduling, budgeting, procurement, construction, and all other aspects of placing assets into service.
 
In 2000, Clint joined American Campus Communities as a project manager. Since that time, he has spearheaded more than 50 projects and supervised the successful completion of more than 30,000 beds and $1.5 billion in development costs, all on time and within the approved budgets. Clint is a LEED® Accredited Professional and has participated at the highest level in the delivery of ACC’s approximately 20 LEED-certified communities, including seven LEED Silver and four LEED Gold projects.

He has also taken the lead in a number of ACC’s largest projects, including two projects with a development value of more than $200 million and approximately eight projects with development values above $100 million. To date, Clint’s two largest and most complex projects are Camino del Sol and Vista del Campo at the University of California, Irvine ($220.9 million, 1,763 beds) and Homeport Hampton Roads for the U.S. Navy ($336.0 million, 3,682 beds).
 
Before joining ACC, Clint held various construction management positions with private real estate developer JPI from 1996 to 2000. 
 



Noel Brinkman 
SVP, Public Private Partnerships

Noel Brinkman 
SVP, Public Private Partnerships

Texas State University, San Marcos
B.B.A., Marketing and Finance, Summa Cum Laude
 
First student housing experience: Falls Hall – a 1966 traditional residence hall. It was later demolished and replaced in 2012.
 
Best college-themed movie/TV show: Rudy
 
Favorite thing about college: The experiences shared with friends and fellow Delta Chi fraternity members.
Noel and his team drive American Campus Communities’ business development efforts under the P3 (public private partnership) model. All told, he has participated in the awarding of roughly $2.1 billion (31,500 beds) in student housing for both public and private universities, with single projects ranging in size from $7.5 million to more than $350 million.
 
One of Noel’s key responsibilities involves helping university leaders determine whether privatization and the subsequent procurement processes are a viable alternative to a more traditional student housing approach. Ultimately, Noel works to demonstrate how these institutions can utilize the private sector to deliver the types of housing that today’s student consumers demand, efficiently and much more cost-effectively – for both the university and the future residents.
 
In his 15+ years with ACC, Noel has served in a variety of capacities – including market analyst, director of development, and VP of on-campus development. He is an active participant in numerous industry conferences, such as NACUBO, ACUHO-I, SCUP, AOA and NACAS.
 
Outside of his work, Noel is busy with his four children and an active member of the local area Boy Scouts board. 



Steve Crawford
SVP, Management Services 

Steve Crawford
SVP, Management Services 

The University of California at Santa Barbara
B.S., Geography  
San Diego State University, M.A., Public Administration  
Former Resident Assistant  

First student housing experience: Private residence hall – on a wonderful floor of 66 people with a fantastic sense of community.

Best college-themed movie/TV show: Good Will Hunting

Most people don't know: I have landed in an airplane on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier

Favorite thing about college: I went to UC Santa Barbara. It’s hard to beat having the beach on your doorstep!
Steve spearheads American Campus Communities’ third-party management division, recognized as the nation’s premier student housing manager. Currently, he oversees 51 managed communities and more than 39,000 beds. Steve’s responsibilities include procurement of third-party management contracts as well as supervising business operations, facilities maintenance, marketing and leasing, residence life and student development, and staffing for ACC-managed communities.
 
However, his primary mission is to deliver the optimal living-learning experience for our student residents, while exceeding the standards and overall goals of our client institutions.
 
More than 25 years ago, Steve began his career in student housing as a Resident Assistant and ultimately Residential Life Director at a privately owned residence hall near UC Santa Barbara.
 
Steve originally planned to fly F-15s in the Air Force. However, poor vision and the end of the Cold War made that dream less likely, so Steve ultimately chose what he calls “the world’s second most exciting profession” – student housing! After graduation, he continued his career at El Conquistador near San Diego State University, and later at Granville Towers, a premier community of more than 1,400 students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.



Ryan Dennison 
SVP, Capital Markets and Investor Relations

Ryan Dennison 
SVP, Capital Markets and Investor Relations

Texas A&M University
B.A. Accounting
M.S. Finance

First student housing experience: Hotard Hall as a freshman at Texas A&M. The dorm was built in 1939 to house food service workers for the campus cafeteria, transitioning to student housing in the 1950’s. I lived with 5 roommates in the television lounge my first semester due to a lack of on-campus housing. While we had a great time, 6 guys in a TV lounge makes it difficult to focus on academics! 

Most memorable college experience: Honestly it was trying to find my dorm on move-in day. I had never seen the dorm before driving myself to college, so I spent about 30 minutes trying to navigate campus with students and parents everywhere. Once I finally located the tiny brick building where I’d live my first year, I thought “seriously….this is it???”

Favorite thing about college: With my closest family over 800 miles away, I loved the thrill of knowing I was on my own and having the freedom and responsibility to make life choices.

Something most people don't know: David Robinson, formerly of the San Antonio Spurs, nearly ruined my career.

Favorite college-themed movie: The Program 
 
Ryan is responsible for the development and implementation of capital market strategies, managing bank group relationships, sourcing capital for growth activities, serving as a primary point of contact with equity and fixed income investors and research analysts, and managing investor communications. He joined ACC in April 2013 as vice president of investor relations, and in 2014 increased his responsibilities to include corporate finance and capital markets.
 
During his tenure, Ryan has assisted with the sourcing of approximately $3 billion in debt or equity and has overseen an expansion of sell-side research coverage to eighteen institutions.
 
Prior to joining the ACC team, Ryan served as the corporate treasurer and director of financial planning and analysis at Thermon Group, Inc. where he assisted with the company’s successful initial public offering in 2011. Ryan began his career as an auditor with Ernst & Young LLP in Austin, Texas where he served in increasing capacities from 2000 until 2010, focusing his efforts auditing public companies. Ryan is a licensed CPA and also enjoys participating in charitable activities, serving as a Board member of the Center for Child Protection.

The University of Central Florida
B.B.A., Management
Former ACC Community Assistant

Favorite thing about college: Meeting new friends and sharing an incredible time with them – plus the beginning of a very challenging, successful career!

He also oversees the development of annual property and strategic plans, implementation of our annual lease up, and coordination of terms.
 
In 2000, Larry began his ACC career as a Community Assistant while attending The University of Central Florida. It’s safe to say Larry knows how to manage every aspect of our communities—because he’s done it personally.

Kimberly Kelley 
SVP/Marketing Operations

Texas A&M University

First student housing experience: Woman's Residence Tower - an all-girl, suite-style, cinderblock accommodation with one window the size of a pizza box.

First student housing experience: Moving into a residence hall that had very industrial metal furniture and sharing a bathroom with 30 other college freshman girls. I was shocked to learn that I did not have a curfew!

Most memorable college experience: On the first night of my freshman year, the RA staff held a hall meeting for all the residents to get to know one another.

Favorite thing about college: Football season, the RA staffs that I was a part of, and the friendships I made.

First student housing experience: Typical cinder-block on-campus residence hall – didn’t have to buy my own stereo, thanks to the loud guy 12 doors down.
 
Favorite college movie: Animal House
 
Favorite thing about college: The freedom, which helped me define who I was and who I wanted to be, plus all the counseling, coaching, and support from professors and fellow students.

Jason Wills
SVP, On-Campus Development

The University of Texas at Arlington,
Journalism and Marketing
 
First student housing experience: I lived in Brazos House for about three semesters. We had pipes running through our rooms that worked for drying laundry as well as communication. You could bang on the pipes to tell people down the hall you were ready to hang out. It was a terrible place and I had a wonderful time.
 
Favorite college movie: Road Trip and Animal House
 
Favorite thing about college: I lived on campus the entire time and was very involved – president of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, editor of the Short Horn student newspaper, an RA and a Student Ambassador. It all gave me a wonderful student experience with friendships and connections that exist to this day. Nobody out there believes in the benefits of student involvement and on-campus life more than I do. 
Jason is responsible for all aspects of American Campus Communities’ on-campus development projects – including market analysis, project feasibility, design, team oversight, and managing relationships with our college or university partners.
 
Every university has a unique vision for the student experience. Jason works closely with our partners to customize housing solutions that best serve the student body as well as the university’s mission and values, architectural design standards, financial goals, and operational needs. To date, Jason has spearheaded 64 projects totaling nearly $3.2 billion in development value – including 17 of our 25 largest projects.
 
Throughout his career, Jason has worked in every functional aspect of student housing – beginning as a Resident Assistant and marketing coordinator with Century Development. One of ACC’s longest-tenured employees, he joined the company in 1997 as a Marketing and Leasing Manager. Over the years, Jason’s role expanded into business development, corporate marketing, and development oversight. Most recently, he served as SVP of Marketing and Development.
 
Jason was deeply involved in the genesis of the 21st Century Project, a groundbreaking initiative of the Association of College and University Housing Officers-International (ACUHO-I). Working with fellow members of the ACUHO-I Foundation Board, Jason helped envision the student housing of the future and outlined the planning principles that are transforming our industry. Under Jason’s leadership, ACC has combined these principles with our experience and operational expertise, resulting in on-campus developments that fully support and enhance the academic experience of today’s university students.
 
Outside of work, Jason is a big supporter of the arts and serves on the board of Ballet Austin.

Where students love living.®



It's not just our company tagline. It's how we run our business every single day.

We believe every student should love where they live. That’s why our number one priority is delivering the best possible experience for students — at every price point. It’s the goal we continually strive for, and the mantra that shapes our values as an organization.




See our values




Built from the ground up.






We understand the student experience because student housing is all we do.




In 1984 our CEO Bill Bayless began his career as a Resident Assistant and found his passion in life: helping students succeed. He turned that passion for student success into the company he runs today. It's a passion we all share. In fact, most of the management team first joined the company as students working at ACC communities.

Overview[edit]
ACC is the nation's largest developer and manager of private student housing in the United States. In 2004, American Campus became the first student housing real estate investment trust, (REIT) to become publicly traded. Currently, American Campus manages approximately 200 properties with over 130,000 beds, many in partnership with universities on campus property. Some developments also involve the use of third party nonprofit owner/lessors, which allow tax-exempt bonds to be used to finance the developments.[citation needed]
American Campus is part of a growing trend of independently operated housing serving university students; in particular, cash-strapped public universities have found it financially beneficial to allow outside companies to assume the debt generated by housing projects, freeing up capital for the university to spend on other facilities. For example, American Campus developed and manages four properties for the University of California, Irvine, that are owned by the nonprofits EAH Housing and Collegiate Housing Foundation, respectively. While under state law, any money charged by the University of California directly for housing must be used for housing purposes, the rent paid by EAH and the Collegiate Housing Foundation for use of campus property can be used for any purpose. Further, the university bears none of the debt used to finance the property, yet uses these private owned facilities as part of the housing guarantee it extends to students.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Buildings S and T in the Hill Country Galleria shopping development,[3] in Bee Cave, Texas, near Austin.[4][5] The ACM headquarters occupies 46,000 square feet (4,300 m2) of space.[6] The company offices were scheduled to open there in December 2010.[3]
Previously American Campus Communities had its headquarters in Las Cimas, an office complex in unincorporated Travis County, Texas, near Austin.[7] ACC sublet area that was leased by Dell USA.[8] ACC moved out of Las Cimas and moved to Bee Caves.[6]

We understand the student experience because student housing is all we do.




In 1984 our CEO Bill Bayless began his career as a Resident Assistant and found his passion in life: helping students succeed. He turned that passion for student success into the company he runs today. It's a passion we all share.

Overview[edit]
ACC is the nation's largest developer and manager of private student housing in the United States. In 2004, American Campus became the first student housing real estate investment trust, (REIT) to become publicly traded. Currently, American Campus manages approximately 200 properties with over 130,000 beds, many in partnership with universities on campus property. Some developments also involve the use of third party nonprofit owner/lessors, which allow tax-exempt bonds to be used to finance the developments.[citation needed]
American Campus is part of a growing trend of independently operated housing serving university students; in particular, cash-strapped public universities have found it financially beneficial to allow outside companies to assume the debt generated by housing projects, freeing up capital for the university to spend on other facilities. For example, American Campus developed and manages four properties for the University of California, Irvine, that are owned by the nonprofits EAH Housing and Collegiate Housing Foundation, respectively. While under state law, any money charged by the University of California directly for housing must be used for housing purposes, the rent paid by EAH and the Collegiate Housing Foundation for use of campus property can be used for any purpose. Further, the university bears none of the debt used to finance the property, yet uses these private owned facilities as part of the housing guarantee it extends to students.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Buildings S and T in the Hill Country Galleria shopping development,[3] in Bee Cave, Texas, near Austin.[4][5] The ACM headquarters occupies 46,000 square feet (4,300 m2) of space.[6] The company offices were scheduled to open there in December 2010.[3]
Previously American Campus Communities had its headquarters in Las Cimas, an office complex in unincorporated Travis County, Texas, near Austin.[7] ACC sublet area that was leased by Dell USA.[8] ACC moved out of Las Cimas and moved to Bee Caves.[6]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
