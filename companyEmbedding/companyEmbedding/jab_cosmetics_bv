Make a Qualified Choice







Is the professional brand-name product line that you are currently promoting and selling in your salon, now easily available to your customers on the Internet, or in a Beauty Supply Store near you (possibly at a better price than you can offer).. 







Are you and your customers satisfied with the quality and efficacy of the professional products and supplies being used and sold in your Salon or Spa..? ... have you asked for our free samples Program and compared our Famous European Quality..?







Are the prices that you are now paying for professional skin care products and supplies attractive and profitable to you..? ...have you done your homework and compared them with our impressive prices ..?







4. Are you aware that some manufacturers and distributors of the well known exclusive in the past salon and spa products (to lower their costs) transferred the formulations, know how, and processing to developing countries ...?







You will find the answers to these questions and solutions to many other professional concerns when you progress through our Web Site







... Skin Care Professional: Stay Secure in Era of political and economic uncertainties ... 







Important and helpful to know :







The Internet and Globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at professional Salons and Spa. This new trend is forcing salons and Spas around the world to find alternative paths to compete and prosper







Traditionally, Salons and Spas were using professional (domestic and foreign) popular brand-name skin care products. Up to recent past, these brands were truly exclusive. Only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale, and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers. This process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beauty-supply stores







Current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the Internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity. Inevitably, the Internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brand-name product that you sell in your salon, in a much faster, more convenient, and more affordable way. The distributors that you rely on for your "exclusivity" are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brand-name products found previously only at professional Salons and Spas like yours







Now literally anyone can purchase retail in a Beauty Supply store or Online almost any salon brand-name product,







 







They are widely available on countless Internet sites 






 






This Trend Is Already Affecting Your Business:







Diminished the professional image of your Salon; 







Diminished your role as a provider of an exclusive product line; 







Inevitably caused the significant decline of your product sales and customer loyalty.







You have worked hard to establish your practice. You have struggled to maintain your clientele. You have invested monetarily as well as emotionally. Now is the time to safeguard and protect your investment.








 





MAKE A SMART MOVE TOWARD YOUR PRIVATE LABEL





Compare RAYA® quality and prices with products you are using now












Recognize, that only promoting your own name on private label (see Options of Private Labeling) skin care and cosmetic products will protect you from having your business and profits undercut by new marketing trends.






Now, as never before, it has become necessary for Salons, Spas, Estheticians, and Dermatologists to promote their name click here on their retail and back-bar products so that they can be protected from declining customer sales and loyalty.






By establishing your name on the label, you are promoting yourself, not other existing brand-named companies, and you are securing your own business. 







By buying directly from the cosmetic manufacturing company, you bypass the middle-man distribution chain and substantially cut your costs. Compare RAYA®'s prices.







In addition, by incorporating our in-salon custom blending click here techniques, you are able to customize treatments to your clients' individual needs. As a result, you are better equipped to compete in the ever-expanding and diverse skin care market.







Discover RAYA® Superior Quality and attractive prices. Compare with Brand Name Products you are using now














With Your Name on the product and our time proven European quality you are progressively securing a place for yourself in the rapidly changing market.

600 SKIN RECOVERY MASQUE





This creamy, emollient rich, antioxidant and multi-vitamin treatment mask is designed to enhance micro-circulation, improve epidermal regeneration, and naturally brighten your skin complexion. Sea Buckthorn Berry delivers effective restorative properties due to its high content of essential fatty acids, carotenes, tocopherols, and phytosterols. Elements which are all essential for healthy skin. Nutrient rich carrot oil, mango butter, and natural plant extracts help to increase the skin moisture level, oxygen uptake, and prevent early appearance of wrinkles.





Contains:

Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use:





This is a moisture rich, creamy, whipped soufflé consistency nourishing mask with a light berry scent. The yellow color comes from Carrot Oil and Sea Buckthorn Oil. It is a non-setting type of phytotherapy mask (does not dry on the skin). Use of masks following serums and creams improves treatment properties and absorption of these products. Mask’s properties could be customized to clients needs by blending appropriate serums (Vital Silk, Vitanol A, Line Preventing Serum) and creams (Vitaplex C, Revitalizing Cream, Bio Effective Night Cream), directly into the mask prior to skin application. A flash “moisture boost” effect helps to seal in the active ingredients contained in this treatment.





In-Salon application:





Analyze your client’s skin to determine the correct treatment mask to use. Remove enough mask for one application with a disposable spatula from the bulk container and place in a smaller container for skin application or custom blending. Use on cleansed skin. Before proceeding protect the client’s eyes with cotton pads dampened in warm water. Apply a thick layer with a brush, spatula or fingertips (a nickel-sized amount or more) over the entire face starting with the neck line, then jaws, cheeks, chin, nose and forehead. Avoid applying mask to lips, mouth, hairline, eyebrows and the area around the eyes. Ask the client if they are comfortable. Leave on for 5 to 15 minutes. The mask should be removed with tepid to warm water and cotton. Tone and refresh with appropriate toner (Aloe Cucumber or Ginseng Toners) and follow with a moisturizer or specialty product. Remove cotton pads from the client’s eyes. For combination skin types, two masks can be used at the same time. Mild masks formulated for oily skin (Volcanic Mud Mask, Mint Mask) can be used on oily areas, and masks formulated for dry skin (Skin Recovery Mask, Collagen Cream Mask, Placenta Nourishing Mask) on the dry areas. For non-sensitive, dryer skin types can be used as a final emollient, calming, moisturizing and skin protective mask following in-salon procedures (Micro-Dermabrasion, Glycolic, Enzymes, LED).





Key ingredient functions and product benefits: 





Helps to reduce visible signs of aging, Supplies vital nutrients to the skin. Promotes skin balance and comfort. Sesame Oil, Safflower Oil, Squalane, Mango Butter, Glycerin and Carrot Oil protect from moisture loss and provide nourishment to the skin. Retinyl Palmitate, Tocophyrol and Ascorbyl Palmitate show skin renewal properties, help to calm inflammation and refine pores. Ginseng Extract, Sea Buckthorn Oil and Aloe Vera Gel provide soothing and healing properties. Collagen, a soluble protein, effectively helps to diminish wrinkles and age lines while restoring elasticity to skin. Contains Pentapeptides for improved Collagen and Elastin production to further reduce and slow the formation of new lines and wrinkles.

600 SKIN RECOVERY MASQUE





This creamy, emollient rich, antioxidant and multi-vitamin treatment mask is designed to enhance micro-circulation, improve epidermal regeneration, and naturally brighten your skin complexion. Sea Buckthorn Berry delivers effective restorative properties due to its high content of essential fatty acids, carotenes, tocopherols, and phytosterols. Elements which are all essential for healthy skin. Nutrient rich carrot oil, mango butter, and natural plant extracts help to increase the skin moisture level, oxygen uptake, and prevent early appearance of wrinkles.





Contains:





Aloe Vera Gel, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Zinc Oxide, Glyceryl Stearate, Titanium Dioxide, Sesame Oil, Safflower Oil, Squalene, Guar Gum, Sea Buckthorn Berry Oil, Carrot Oil, Extracts of Chamomile, Ginseng, Cucumber, and Ginkgo Biloba, Phenoxyethanol, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocophyrol, Ascorbyl Palmitate and Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Mango Butter, Fragrant Oils, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Marine Collagen, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid. Caution: Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use:





This is a moisture rich, creamy, whipped soufflé consistency nourishing mask with a light berry scent. The yellow color comes from Carrot Oil and Sea Buckthorn Oil. It is a non-setting type of phytotherapy mask (does not dry on the skin). Use of masks following serums and creams improves treatment properties and absorption of these products. Mask’s properties could be customized to clients needs by blending appropriate serums (Vital Silk, Vitanol A, Line Preventing Serum) and creams (Vitaplex C, Revitalizing Cream, Bio Effective Night Cream), directly into the mask prior to skin application. A flash “moisture boost” effect helps to seal in the active ingredients contained in this treatment.





In-Salon application:





Analyze your client’s skin to determine the correct treatment mask to use. Remove enough mask for one application with a disposable spatula from the bulk container and place in a smaller container for skin application or custom blending. Use on cleansed skin. Before proceeding protect the client’s eyes with cotton pads dampened in warm water. Apply a thick layer with a brush, spatula or fingertips (a nickel-sized amount or more) over the entire face starting with the neck line, then jaws, cheeks, chin, nose and forehead. Avoid applying mask to lips, mouth, hairline, eyebrows and the area around the eyes. Ask the client if they are comfortable. Leave on for 5 to 15 minutes. The mask should be removed with tepid to warm water and cotton. Tone and refresh with appropriate toner (Aloe Cucumber or Ginseng Toners) and follow with a moisturizer or specialty product. Remove cotton pads from the client’s eyes. For combination skin types, two masks can be used at the same time. Mild masks formulated for oily skin (Volcanic Mud Mask, Mint Mask) can be used on oily areas, and masks formulated for dry skin (Skin Recovery Mask, Collagen Cream Mask, Placenta Nourishing Mask) on the dry areas. For non-sensitive, dryer skin types can be used as a final emollient, calming, moisturizing and skin protective mask following in-salon procedures (Micro-Dermabrasion, Glycolic, Enzymes, LED).





Key ingredient functions and product benefits: 





Helps to reduce visible signs of aging, Supplies vital nutrients to the skin. Promotes skin balance and comfort. Sesame Oil, Safflower Oil, Squalane, Mango Butter, Glycerin and Carrot Oil protect from moisture loss and provide nourishment to the skin. Retinyl Palmitate, Tocophyrol and Ascorbyl Palmitate show skin renewal properties, help to calm inflammation and refine pores. Ginseng Extract, Sea Buckthorn Oil and Aloe Vera Gel provide soothing and healing properties. Collagen, a soluble protein, effectively helps to diminish wrinkles and age lines while restoring elasticity to skin. Contains Pentapeptides for improved Collagen and Elastin production to further reduce and slow the formation of new lines and wrinkles.

Make a Qualified Choice







Is the professional brand-name product line that you are currently promoting and selling in your salon, now easily available to your customers on the Internet, or in a Beauty Supply Store near you (possibly at a better price than you can offer).. 







Are you and your customers satisfied with the quality and efficacy of the professional products and supplies being used and sold in your Salon or Spa..? ... have you asked for our free samples Program and compared our Famous European Quality..?







Are the prices that you are now paying for professional skin care products and supplies attractive and profitable to you..? ...have you done your homework and compared them with our impressive prices ..?







4. Are you aware that some manufacturers and distributors of the well known exclusive in the past salon and spa products (to lower their costs) transferred the formulations, know how, and processing to developing countries ...?







You will find the answers to these questions and solutions to many other professional concerns when you progress through our Web Site







... Skin Care Professional: Stay Secure in Era of political and economic uncertainties ... 







Important and helpful to know :







The Internet and Globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at professional Salons and Spa. This new trend is forcing salons and Spas around the world to find alternative paths to compete and prosper







Traditionally, Salons and Spas were using professional (domestic and foreign) popular brand-name skin care products. Up to recent past, these brands were truly exclusive. Only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale, and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers. This process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beauty-supply stores







Current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the Internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity. Inevitably, the Internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brand-name product that you sell in your salon, in a much faster, more convenient, and more affordable way. The distributors that you rely on for your "exclusivity" are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brand-name products found previously only at professional Salons and Spas like yours







Now literally anyone can purchase retail in a Beauty Supply store or Online almost any salon brand-name product,







 







They are widely available on countless Internet sites 






 






This Trend Is Already Affecting Your Business:







Diminished the professional image of your Salon; 







Diminished your role as a provider of an exclusive product line; 







Inevitably caused the significant decline of your product sales and customer loyalty.







You have worked hard to establish your practice. You have struggled to maintain your clientele. You have invested monetarily as well as emotionally. Now is the time to safeguard and protect your investment.








 





MAKE A SMART MOVE TOWARD YOUR PRIVATE LABEL





Compare RAYA® quality and prices with products you are using now












Recognize, that only promoting your own name on private label (see Options of Private Labeling) skin care and cosmetic products will protect you from having your business and profits undercut by new marketing trends.






Now, as never before, it has become necessary for Salons, Spas, Estheticians, and Dermatologists to promote their name click here on their retail and back-bar products so that they can be protected from declining customer sales and loyalty.






By establishing your name on the label, you are promoting yourself, not other existing brand-named companies, and you are securing your own business. 







By buying directly from the cosmetic manufacturing company, you bypass the middle-man distribution chain and substantially cut your costs. Compare RAYA®'s prices.







In addition, by incorporating our in-salon custom blending click here techniques, you are able to customize treatments to your clients' individual needs. As a result, you are better equipped to compete in the ever-expanding and diverse skin care market.







Discover RAYA® Superior Quality and attractive prices. Compare with Brand Name Products you are using now














With Your Name on the product and our time proven European quality you are progressively securing a place for yourself in the rapidly changing market.

300 Vitamin-B Cream





This highly effective, yet very light, day cream is recommended for normal to oily, blemished and problem skin. A complex of natural botanical extracts, vitamins, and amino acids help to moisturize and balance the skin, while natural Vitamin B Complex (Yeast Extract) helps to regulate oil gland secretion to reduce the possibility of clogged pores, inflammations, and breakouts associated with an oily skin condition and the use of make-up products. After cleansing and toning, use once or twice daily.





Contains:





Aloe Vera Gel, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Decyl Oleate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Alginate, Aquas Extracts of Chamomile, and Cucumber, Blackcurrant Extract, Tamarind Extract, Apple Extract, Yeast Extract (Vitamin B), Carbomer, Ginseng Extract, Allantoin, d-Penthanol, Retinyl Palmitate, Glucose, Fructose, Sucrose, Dextrin, Glutamic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Guar Gum, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid.





Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use: 





This non-greasy, water based oil control formula can be used as a final step in oily and blemished skin facial by applying over moist skin. Designed to be compatible with Camphor Soufflé, Mint Soufflé and Active Cleansing Gel cleansers, and Camphor, Eucalyptus or Blemish control astringents. For a more aggressive treatment Glycolic gel GX50 or Blemish control gel can be used prior to cream application. This cream does not leave residue.





Key ingredient functions and product benefits:





It is important to maintain a regular moisturizing routine to keep the skin from becoming too irritated or dry. Dehydrated oily skin can result in breakouts as the skin overcompensates by producing more oil. An oil control moisturizer may be desired in order to reduce shine and maintain skin’s moisture balance, therefore reducing the need for make up powders (which can contain pore clogging ingredients). The primary cause of dryness in oily skin is excessive water evaporation from the skin surface. Rich in humectants (the substances that can trap and hold water) this product helps to keep the skin hydrated while controlling oil overproduction. Amino acid complex, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, and Sodium Hyaluronate provide moisture binding activity. Fruit extracts of Blackcurrant, Tamarind, and Apple help to balance the skin’s pH and control bacteria. Yeast Extract (Vitamin B) controls oil. Allantoin and Aloe Vera help to soothe problem skin. Absorbs rapidly providing immediate hydration.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
