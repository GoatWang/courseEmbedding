Bakken Update: Adding To The Oil Glut, Part 2 - Eagle Ford Production Increased 46.5% Per Well In 2015 - The United States Oil ETF, LP (NYSEARCA:USO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Bakken Update: Adding To The Oil Glut, Part 2 - Eagle Ford Production Increased 46.5% Per Well In 2015Nov.21.16 | About: The United (USO) Michael Filloon Oil & gas, energy, hedge fund manager, commoditiesValley New LiveSummaryMega-Frac style completions are showing even bigger improvements in the Eagle Ford than the Bakken.Operators are increasing the number of stages and volumes of frac sand and fluids with good results.Completion design is still in its infancy, and we believe better technologies and design are on the way.The Bakken and Eagle Ford improvements are nothing short of spectacular, and the reason breakevens continue to head lower.Oil and gas received a bullish lift from the Trump upset. The drop in oil price since 2014 has created difficulty for levered E&Ps. Things could change. Trump's protectionist vision of US energy independence could provide relief. Reduced taxes, refiner credits, and decreased regulation are all possibilities. This could provide a more level playing field. If refiners are the focus, the WTI/Brent differential could change. US production would also increase. Depending on policy, there are disagreements on its effect. Some believe this will push down the price of oil. Oil production increases should increase the world glut, but we have a different vision. Protectionist policies may not decrease world oil prices because the biggest consumer would be self-sufficient (we would still need to import heavy sour crude). WTI (West Texas Intermediate) would de-lever from Brent because the customer base would be different, as would be supply and demand. Trump believes he can get US refiners to switch to lighter grades of crude (this would require a significant investment to make the conversion to larger volumes of WTI). This should be a positive for the US Oil ETF (NYSEARCA:USO), but there's a low ceiling to prices. Trump's economic vision has US refiners using more WTI and Canadian crude as feedstock. Depending on legislation, we could see US oil prices increase and Brent decrease. Wider differentials could be problematic. We do not know how it will affect world oil markets. If the price of WTI increases, it would be a negative for crack spreads. This means refiners could have increased difficulty competing internationally. Without its number one consumer, OPEC will be more ineffective. Difficulties policing production of members could become chaotic. It would be every man for himself.
 Unconventional production continues to improve. Opinions differ, as some believe there is limited upside. They believe we have maxed out our ability to recover more oil in place. Petroleum engineers would disagree. Unconventional well design is in its infancy. Recent changes have been effective. The move from cheaper sleeves to plug and perf has increased production per foot. There is a good chance it will continue. 

 (Source: Bill Barrett) Bill Barrett Corp. (NYSE:BBG) has improved well design. It was using a 40-stage sliding sleeve, then moved to plug and perf. It increased the number of stages while maintaining lateral length. This effectively shortens each stage from 237.5 feet to 172.7 feet. The perf intervals tightened from 240 feet to every 60. Operators continue to increase the volumes of sand used per foot. Pioneer (NYSE:PXD), RSP Permian (NYSE:RSPP), Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG), Concho (NYSE:CXO), Devon (NYSE:DVN) and Cimarex (NYSE:XEC) are just a few names increasing sand usage. Mega-Fracs have worked very well. In some instances, the completion uses sand only and no ceramics. EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) has done this for years. This is bullish for sand producers like U.S. Silica (NYSE:SLCA), Fairmount (NYSE:FMSA), Hi-Crush (NYSE:HCLP), Emerge (NYSE:EMES), and Smart Sand (NASDAQ:SND). It is bearish for ceramic proppant producers like CARBO (NYSE:CRR). Frac fluids usage is also increasing. This benefits Flotek (NYSE:FTK) and Newpark (NYSE:NR). In our last article, we covered Bakken oil and natural gas production from 2013 to 2015. This comparison found that Mega-Frac style wells continue to show impressive production results, with an increase of 27.3% from 2013 to 2015. From 2014 to 2015, the number of completions decreased by 30% but oil production decreased just 16%. The trend is more production per location. More importantly, we are seeing more production per foot. This increase currently offsets approximately half of the production lost to decreased activity. The Bakken was the first major basin developed in the United States. It was followed by the Eagle Ford and Permian. We are analyzing oil data to show the differences by basin. It is possible these production increases are greater in areas with lower breakevens. If so, we could assume that other core acreage with less attractive economics also has greater upside to production.

There was a very large decrease in the number of completions. This coupled with the production data provides a significant uptick in oil and natural gas per well.

After the decrease of 8.5% in 2014, a 46.5% increase was delivered in 2015. This compares to increases of 5.7% and 19.6% in North Dakota over that time frame.

The 2015 increase in the Eagle Ford was greater. From 2013 to 2015, Eagle Ford oil production per location increased 34%. This compares to the 27.3% increase in the Bakken. Better source rock stimulation continues to produce better oil production results. EOG was the first to experiment with the idea. We first highlighted these changes to well design in May of 2013. It has taken time for operators to see these improvements and implement. There was a big change to both design and where locations were completed in 2015. High-grading was just beginning, but the combination helped show industry improvement. Further improvements are on the way as we are just figuring out how to frac. If newer well designs are any indicator, we could see core play production increase significantly around $55/bbl to $60/bbl WTI.

Karnes County's long reign as the top crude oil-producing county in Texas appears to be ended.
After months of battling for the top spot, the Permian Basin's Midland County has decisively unseated the Eagle Ford Shale county from that perch, according to the latest production figures from the Railroad Commission of Texas.

Midland County produced more than 6.5 million barrels of crude oil in May compared to nearly 6.2 million barrels in Karnes County, preliminary figures show.




Located about 60 miles south of San Antonio in a "liquids-rich window" of the Eagle Ford, Karnes County emerged as a hot spot in the early days of shale boom and maintained that position. But during the crude oil downturn, new drilling activity decreased in Karnes County and shifted to the Permian Basin of West Texas, where the combination of several oil-rich geological layers and low service company prices have made it the hottest shale play in the United States.
Since 2008, the Eagle Ford has produced more than 2.3 billion barrels of crude oil since 2008, University of Texas at San Antonio Economics Professor Thomas Tunstall told the Business Journal.
Despite the average Eagle Ford well producing double the oil of those in the Permian Basin, Tunstall said the sheer volume of new wells in the Permian Basin is more than making up the difference. Midland and three other counties in the Permian Basin have steadily climbed the charts, displacing those in the Eagle Ford.
"It may take 10 years, but eventually production in the Eagle Ford will not be able to keep up with the Permian," Tunstall said.




 


So far this year, some 35 companies have filed 607 drilling permits for new oil wells in Midland County, with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE: PXD), Midland-based Endeavor Energy Resources LP and Fort Worth-based Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. leading the pack.
South Texas Energy & Economic Roundtable President and CEO Omar Garcia said whether or not Karnes County is the state's top crude oil producer, the Eagle Ford is experiencing a slow but steady recovery that is benefiting the region's economy.

Over the past seven months, some 23 companies have filed 389 drilling permits for new oil wells in Karnes County. Houston-based EOG Resources Inc. (NYSE: EOG), the San Antonio office of Marathon Oil Corp. (NYSE: MRO) and Canadian oil company Encana Corp. (NYSE: ECA) are listed as the top three drillers.
The diverse mix of exploration and production companies in Karnes County includes San Antonio-area operators such as Ageron Energy LLC, BlackBrush Oil & Gas LP, GulfTex Energy and Tidal Petroleum, who are also getting a piece of the pie.
"While Karnes County may not be the top oil producer, the Eagle Ford region continues to see activity increasing as compared to 2016," Garcia said. "The activity along the Gulf Coast and a steady rig count have contributed to continued economic activity in the area."

Located about 60 miles south of San Antonio in a "liquids-rich window" of the Eagle Ford, Karnes County emerged as a hot spot in the early days of shale boom and maintained that position. But during the crude oil downturn, new drilling activity decreased in Karnes County and shifted to the Permian Basin of West Texas, where the combination of several oil-rich geological layers and low service company prices have made it the hottest shale play in the United States.
Since 2008, the Eagle Ford has produced more than 2.3 billion barrels of crude oil since 2008, University of Texas at San Antonio Economics Professor Thomas Tunstall told the Business Journal.
Despite the average Eagle Ford well producing double the oil of those in the Permian Basin, Tunstall said the sheer volume of new wells in the Permian Basin is more than making up the difference. Midland and three other counties in the Permian Basin have steadily climbed the charts, displacing those in the Eagle Ford.
"It may take 10 years, but eventually production in the Eagle Ford will not be able to keep up with the Permian," Tunstall said.




 


So far this year, some 35 companies have filed 607 drilling permits for new oil wells in Midland County, with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE: PXD), Midland-based Endeavor Energy Resources LP and Fort Worth-based Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. leading the pack.
South Texas Energy & Economic Roundtable President and CEO Omar Garcia said whether or not Karnes County is the state's top crude oil producer, the Eagle Ford is experiencing a slow but steady recovery that is benefiting the region's economy.

Over the past seven months, some 23 companies have filed 389 drilling permits for new oil wells in Karnes County. Houston-based EOG Resources Inc. (NYSE: EOG), the San Antonio office of Marathon Oil Corp. (NYSE: MRO) and Canadian oil company Encana Corp. (NYSE: ECA) are listed as the top three drillers.
The diverse mix of exploration and production companies in Karnes County includes San Antonio-area operators such as Ageron Energy LLC, BlackBrush Oil & Gas LP, GulfTex Energy and Tidal Petroleum, who are also getting a piece of the pie.
"While Karnes County may not be the top oil producer, the Eagle Ford region continues to see activity increasing as compared to 2016," Garcia said. "The activity along the Gulf Coast and a steady rig count have contributed to continued economic activity in the area."
