Taconic Capital Launches Sidecars for Claims Trades in Iceland


					April 11, 2013

					 
                    Stephen Taub
				

					The event-driven and opportunity-focused hedge fund firm has raised $160 million for two new sidecars, a source says.
				



New York–based Taconic Capital Advisors, a
    multistrategy hedge fund firm, is betting on trade claims
    against the three largest failed banks in Iceland and has
    created sidecars as investment platforms.
According to a source, the sidecar funds have raised a total
    of $160 million in two separate closings. The vehicles are no
    longer open to new investment, a regulatory filing shows. The
    funds are called Taconic Sidecar Fund I, a Delaware limited
    partnership, and Taconic Side Offshore Fund SPC, an offshore
    partnership.
The firm has been investing successfully in trade claims on
    Icelandic banks through the main funds. But this is the first
    time Taconic Capital, founded in 1999, has formed sidecar
    funds. The firm, which managed more than $6.9 billion as of the
    beginning of 2013, runs event-driven funds and opportunity
    funds. According to an investor, "This is an investment
    position held in the existing funds; sidecars were created for
    investors who wanted additional exposure."
Investors in the new vehicles have committed a certain
    amount of capital but don’t have to write the
    checks until the firm is ready to invest. Investors may
    withdraw 100 percent of their capital on a monthly basis. But
    investors may be charged a 1 percent fee on any withdrawals
    made prior to September 1, 2014, the filing said.
In one of the more dramatic consequences of the global
    financial crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers
    Holdings, Iceland’s three major banks —
    Glitnir banki, Landsbanki Íslands and Kaupthing Bank
    — were placed in receivership in October 2008. The
    banks had total debt obligations of about $75 billion,
    according to New York–based law firm Richards Kibbe
    & Orbe in a letter to clients in November 2010. Claims
    filed against the three banks that were tied to the bonds and
    other debt instruments issued by the banks before the crisis
    totaled more than $100 billion.
Since the banks’ failure, a secondary market
    for complex Icelandic claims has emerged involving investment
    banks and hedge funds in the U.S. and Europe, "in spite of the
    substantial legal and economic difficulties involved in trading
    the claims across multiple jurisdictions," the law firm said in
    the letter.
It isn’t clear why Taconic has deemed Icelandic
    bank claims an attractive investment worthy of sidecar
    vehicles. Taconic declined to comment for this article.
In its regulatory filing, Taconic said the sidecars expect
    to invest most of the assets in Icelandic investments, which
    may include fixed-income securities and other trade claims
    against impaired companies.
Sidecars, which are independently managed, separate funds,
    differ from side pockets, which are usually attached to a
    bigger fund. Taconic’s sidecars have a one-year
    investment period, ending in March 2014. According to a source,
    the harvest period is set for two years, although it could be
    extended. The funds charge a 0.25 percent management fee and a
    20 percent performance fee with an 8 percent preferred
    return.
The firm said it may launch additional sidecar funds in the
    future with different investment strategies and different fee
    structures.
Taconic was founded by Frank Brosens and Kenneth Brody, both
    Goldman Sachs & Co. alums. Brosens was a partner who once
    served as head of risk arbitrage, while Brody was a general
    partner and member of the management committee. Brody also
    previously served as president of the Export-Import Bank of the
    United States during the 1990s.
The firm’s flagship Taconic Opportunity fund
    and its Taconic Opportunity Offshore fund were up about 13
    percent in 2012.
