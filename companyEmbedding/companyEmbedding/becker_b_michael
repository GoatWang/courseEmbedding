 Mike Becker's outstanding workbook, takes you through the measuring and drafting process to create your perfect basic pants pattern

Getting the measurements is key to successful pants drafting. The hip is especially difficult to obtain. The special measurement device that you make yourself will take care of this problem.


As you work through the book, you will see each screen shown in the book as your work should appear on your computer screen. Seventy six brilliantly illustrated pages walk you step-by-step through each step in the process, with exceptionally clear and easy-to-follow instructions. 

Once you complete your personal Pants pattern, Mike shows you a wide variety of variations of length and style changes so you can create split skirts, shorts, clam diggers, pleated pants, and much more. In the process, you'll learn how to thoroughly use the DesignaKnit Original Pattern Drafting section!

NOTE: Written using DAK 7, the instructions are still valid using DAK 8 - the screens may look a bit different, but the concepts and tools are the same.

 Day Number Four in the Hospital


Life has been hectic since this past Sunday when Lorie and I drove to New York City for another visit to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center’s (MSKCCs) urgent care facility. Drainage from my chest tube once again changed from amber fluid to the color of a fine Cabernet wine, which signaled that bleeding resumed. More alarming […]

 Never Thought I’d Do It Again


Despite the hectic backdrop of late, I’ve been busy researching treatment options for patients like me with incurable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). My first inclination was to pursue another immunotherapy, as there are a lot of clinical trials with novel immunotherapies and combinations currently recruiting. With my disease progressing, however, […]

 Damned If I Do, Damned If I Don’t


As discussed in my prior blog post, the recent CT scan at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) didn’t turn out as we had hoped. Not only did the cancer show signs of progressing, but a blot clot was also found in my left iliac artery near my pelvis. I had been on Lovenox (enoxaparin) […]

 It Could Always Be Worse


After a full day of activities yesterday, Lorie and I decided to grab an early dinner in Bethesda, MD at a restaurant recommended to us. We really haven’t explored much of the local establishments, so it was nice to venture out and try something new. We sat down and I immediately focused on the cheese […]

 Thankful for Cancer?


In recent blog posts, I discussed my interest in trying new things, such as transcendental meditation, acupuncture, sound therapy, etc. I connected with other terminal cancer patients and found that some of them were pursuing similar avenues. Through these interactions, I was introduced and started reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal […]

 Help Eradicate Six Cancers Caused by HPV


As a sexually transmitted disease, discussions surrounding human papillomavirus (HPV) can understandably be uncomfortable and/or embarrassing. Interestingly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is so common that nearly ALL sexually active men and women get the virus at some point in their lives. About 79 million Americans (~25% of the […]

 Watching the Calendar


Earlier this week, Lorie and I made our biweekly visit to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for my infusion of the experimental agent M7824. The two day trip was uneventful and included a variety of imaging and other diagnostic tests, including an ultrasound of my spleen and a chest x-ray to monitor the pleural […]

 Puppy Power


I am often asked how I stay upbeat and positive in the face of a terminal cancer diagnosis. Keeping busy/distracted and trying new things are definitely key pieces of advice I would offer fellow survivors. Recently, I started acupuncture and sound therapy with Sharon Czebotar. I was skeptical about acupuncture until being offered the service while […]

 Roller Coaster


It’s been a couple of weeks since my last clinical post, so I wanted to provide an update following this week’s NIH appointments. First, surgical insertion of my Aspira® drainage system has dramatically improved the pleural effusion in my left lung. It’s essentially a chest tube/catheter that allows me to drain the fluid buildup on […]

 Memoir Published


Well, gulp! My memoir is finally done and published. A Walk With Purpose chronicles my career path from an investment advisor to chief executive officer of an oncology-focused biotechnology company, and finally into a terminal cancer patient confronting his own mortality. It is a memoir about both my life and illness, battling stage 4 head […]

"Truthfinder is a very accurate updated system. Their information is proper. And can be very helpful too." -Juan M.









Notice
This site contains REAL police records (court records of driving citations, speeding tickets, felonies, misdemeanors, sexual offenses, mugshots, etc.), background reports, photos, court documents, address information, phone numbers, and much more. Please BE CAREFUL when conducting a search and ensure all the information you enter is accurate.
Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
