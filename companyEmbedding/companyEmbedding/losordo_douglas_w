NeoStem Appoints Douglas W. Losordo as Chief Medical Officer


August 6, 2013    				   	












Andrew L. Pecora to Assume New Role as Chief Visionary Officer
NEW YORK, Aug. 6, 2013 — NeoStem, Inc. (Nasdaq:NBS) (“NeoStem” or the “Company”), a leader in the emerging cellular therapy market, announced today the appointment of Douglas W. Losordo, MD, FACC, FAHA, as Chief Medical Officer of the Company. Dr. Losordo is a leader in cell therapy research and a renowned cardiologist. Most recently, Dr. Losordo was Vice President, New Therapies Development, Regenerative Medicine and Baxter Ventures at Baxter International.
Dr. Losordo is well regarded for his career-long efforts to develop novel therapeutics and as a scientist he obtained over $35 million in National Institutes of Health funding for discovering and developing new therapeutic concepts in the laboratory, providing the basis for clinical studies. He has led first in human studies in multiple gene and adult stem cell therapies in patients with cardiovascular diseases, including therapies now in Phase 3 testing. He is a highly sought after speaker, having given over 200 international lectures. He is an associate editor of Circulation Research, the basic science journal of the American Heart Association and serves on the editorial boards of a number of scientific journals.
“I am excited to join NeoStem in its pursuit of promising cell therapies, including a product candidate using CD34+ cells to repair ischemic tissue, taking us a step closer to true disease modification or reversal, instead of relegating patients to symptom palliation,” said Dr. Losordo. “The Company is hard at work to unlock the future of cell therapies, a shared goal to which I have also devoted my professional career.”
Andrew L. Pecora, MD, FACC, the Company’s outgoing Chief Medical Officer, will assume the role of Chief Visionary Officer of NeoStem, where he will continue to assist in building a leading global cell therapy company. Dr. Pecora will also continue in his role as Chief Medical Officer of Progenitor Cell Therapy (“PCT”), NeoStem’s contract development and manufacturing subsidiary, and Chief Scientific Officer of Amorcyte, LLC, NeoStem’s subsidiary developing a cell therapy to preserve heart muscle function after a severe heart attack, as well as remain a member of NeoStem’s Board of Directors.
Dr. Andrew Pecora said, “The Company has made a sound investment in Dr. Losordo who is an extremely talented and well-respected physician researcher in the cell therapy field. I look forward to collaborating with Dr. Losordo as the Company continues to identify and evaluate regenerative medicine opportunities.”
Dr. Robin L. Smith, Chairman and CEO of NeoStem, said “We are extremely fortunate to have Doug Losordo join our leadership team. Doug will no doubt complement the stellar medical regime that Andrew Pecora has built, as well as help us move forward in our efforts to develop novel proprietary cell therapy products and platform technologies.”
Dr. Losordo is an adjunct professor of medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. From 2006 to 2011, he was the director of the Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute and the Eileen M. Foell Professor of Heart Research at Northwestern University’s School of Medicine and director of the Program in Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. From 2004 to 2006, he was a Professor of Medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine and Chief of Cardiovascular Research at St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston. He is board-certified in internal medicine, cardiovascular disease, and interventional cardiology. Dr. Losordo’s major research interests encompass angiogenesis/vasculogenesis, progenitor/adult stem cells, tissue repair/regeneration, and vascular biology. He received his medical degree from the University of Vermont.

Alphabetical Listing
Faculty by Department
At a GlanceFeinberg offers a premier medical education and top-notch research programs in large part because of the expertise, experience, and dedication of its faculty. Numbering about 4,000, the medical school's faculty roster includes some of the best minds and hearts in medicine and biomedical research. Many have gained national and international prominence.New FacultyMaryam K Pezhouh, MD, MScAssistant Professor of PathologyMy primary research interests are in the field of Gastrointestinal Pathology, with particular interest in Inflammatory bowel disease and infection.Rimas V Lukas, MDAssociate Professor of Neurology (Neuro-oncology)Dr. Lukas, sub-specializing in neuro-oncology, is interested in the care of patients with primary brain tumors and spinal cord tumors as well as central nervous system (CNS) metastases.  Dr. Lukas's research centers on clinical trials in neuro-oncology.  Additionally, he has a strong interest in medical education in the U.S. and internationally and conducts research in neuroscience medical education.Marina  Arvanitis, MDAssistant Professor of Medicine (General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics)I am a primary care pediatrician and internist, and a health services researcher. My research focuses on health literacy and patient engagement, including the development of health literacy-related quality measures and primary care-based interventions aimed at improving health outcomes. As a primary care physician for patients of all ages, I am particularly interested in how children develop health literacy skills within their families and larger communities, and interventions that can enhance family health literacy.Gemma L Carvill, PhDAssistant Professor of Neurology - Ken and Ruth Davee Department and PharmacologyThe primary aim of our research is to identify the genetic factors and biological mechanisms that cause epilepsy. We use a variety of sequencing technologies to identify new genetic causes in both the DNA regions that code for proteins (genes) and those that control the expression of these genes (regulatory regions). 

The second mission of our lab is to capitalize on the advances in gene discovery in epilepsy to create neuronal models of this disorder. Many of these 'epilepsy' genes are involved in the control of expression of other genes. In other words, they are responsible for switching certain genes 'on' or 'off' during the development and/or functioning of the brain. This switching is dependent on the 3D structure of DNA - called the epigenome. We use stem cell biology to create models of these 'epigenetic' genes to study how mutations affect the structure of the epigenome and the pathways affected. Identifying these pathways are the first step in finding new targets for therapeutics.Christina E Boots, MDAssistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Reproductive Endo and Infertility)Infertility, assisted reproductive technology, polycystic ovary syndrome, effects of nutrition and metabolism on reproductive outcomes, recurrent pregnancy loss, fertility preservation, and diminished ovarian reserve.J. Chad Duncan, PhDAssociate Professor of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationMy current research interests include psychosocial aspects of disability, prosthetics/orthotics and the world of work, and outcome measures. For the past few years I have been investigating how to determine appropriate  protocols for prosthetic and orthotic patients based on informed decision making.Monica M Laronda, PhDAssistant Professor of Pediatrics (Endocrinology)The Laronda Lab investigates fundamental regenerative medicine problems using stem cells and supportive biomimetic environments. Our main objective is to develop a patient-specific ovarian follicle niche that will support systemic endocrine function and fertility in women and girls with disorders of sex development or premature ovarian failure.
http://www.pediatrics.northwestern.edu/research/labs/laronda/index.htmlRenee  C B Manworren, PhDAssociate Professor of PediatricsMy research seeks to culturally transform our sensitivity to children's pain: to better prevent, assess, treat and understand children's pain, especially for predictable pain and pain in children with communication limitations. My focus is acute, post-operative and procedural pain; risk factors for challenging to control acute pain, including genetic differences in pain sensitivity and analgesic metabolism; transition from acute to chronic pain; and predictors of adverse acute pain treatment outcomes, including opioid misuse. I am also the PI for an NIH Center of Excellence for Pain Education and have conducted educational research of pediatric healthcare provider and students knowledge and attitudes regarding pain since 1998.
