Tatoian will continue to report to Denis McGlynn, president and CEO of Dover Motorsports, Inc.

"Mike joined us eight years ago and immediately immersed himself into the operations and culture of our team while earning the respect of both his co-workers and those outside the company as well," Denis McGlynn, president and CEO of Dover Motorsports, Inc., said. "Mike is a valuable and popular contributor to our efforts here and Dover International Speedway will benefit from his leadership for many years to come."

In 2015, Dover will host a national series tripleheader from May 29-31 with the NASCAR Camping World Truck, XFINITY and Sprint Cup Series racing Friday through Sunday. The track will host the third race of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup and final event in the Challenger Round along with another XFINITY race in September.

During his tenure with Dover Motorsports, Inc., Tatoian helped bring the Firefly Music Festival to the speedway. Held at the track since 2012, the four-day event attracts 80,000 fans per day. Another event, the Big Barrel Country Music Festival, was announced Thursday and will bring country music stars Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Jake Owen, Cassadee Pope and more to The Woodlands at Dover International Speedway from June 26-28, 2015.

Tatoian has more than 25 years of experience in professional sports ownership, management and operations. As CEO and managing partner of Victory Sports Group, LLC., he oversaw the development and management of minor league baseball, minor league hockey and arena football teams. He also served as COO of United Sports Ventures, Inc., a company that owned and operated eight minor league teams.

Currently serving as the chairman of the Advisory Council for USO Delaware and previously serving as an honorary commander at the Dover Air Force Base, Tatoian is also a nominee for the Fisher House Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Service Award, a national award that recognizes an individual who has contributed extensively to the support and welfare of members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families.

A graduate of the University of Northern Iowa, with a degree in Public Relations and Marketing, Tatoian and his wife Tammy live in Middletown, Delaware.

He is a liar and he discriminates. If I could give him zero stars I would! And he was a weirdo truly a strange man to my 4 yr old daughter he was very creepy to her! Don't was…te your time! He literally is a liar! After reading more lies about me from this man I must edit this review.... I just want to say this review has absolutely nothing to do with anger. I waited almost a month before I wrote review. This man lied to my face and said exactly this.. That Mass health does not cover pretty much anything with accept ion x-rays and cleanings. He also said that Mass Health makes him refer any other dental work such as dentures and things of that nature, that is not the truth therefore he lied to my face. Also he scheduled my appointment and during this time over the phone he pretty much told me mass health would cover those things and he scheduled my appointment for 1:45 so when I got there he had Megan say that I was late for appointment it was because I had gone to him 4 yrs ago and my gosh he was a terrible man to me and my daughter but he did send me to tiffs dental school. My daughter really was horrified of him. Had I known it was him I never would have made the appointment! Oh and also he tells you I scan tell you everything you have done by checking your teeth which is completely laughable he tells everyone that has bad teeth that they had G.e.r.t. Which is gastrointestinal problems basically and that it causes somethings like acid reflux or something like that ! But I never ever ever had anything like that in my life ! Not even with my 2 pregnancies. Unfortunately he is just one of those dentist that discriminates. He does not care to cater to the lower income population unless he decides it isn't going to be too much work for him to handle. Believe me I am not angry I actually forgive him for treating me so horribly and lying to his staff about the time of my appointment and making me sit there and wait over an hour knowing he was not going to treat me. I just want to note that it's the year of forgiveness mercy and peace I have no reason to write things in a review that are not accurate. He treated me with no respect or dignity ,he was just rude and lied lied lied! Also the receptionist I believe her name is Megan , she was very personable and kind and a very nice person who actually treated me with respect and dignity. She spoke kindly to me! She was wonderful during my visit. I have nothing negative to say about the customer service from her. She gets 5 stars. I will pray for him to learn how to treat lower income demographic. Oh my gosh do the kids ever end with this man. Mass Health currently covers so much more than what he's telling us, they cover partials dentures fillings and lots of other dental procedures so apparently he either doesn't want to help or just doesn't know? Either way doesn't seem right to me. Call any other Dentist locally and they will tell you that Mass Health does cover all that for EVERY AGE , My gosh I feel terrible , maybe he just doesn't know what he's talking about?? more » Worst dentist ever!
