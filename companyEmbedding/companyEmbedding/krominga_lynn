LONG ISLAND JOURNAL; Pedigree Grand House Gets a New Family

LYNN KROMINGA and Amnon Shiboleth were kicking about on their boat in Quantuck Bay when they noticed the white stucco English country cottage. Set back beyond the reeds, the grand home, known as Meadowcroft, looked inviting, with a broad veranda suited to sipping ice tea and savoring the panoramic views.''We sort of zoomed in,'' recalled Ms. Krominga, 54, a lawyer, recognizing the Quiogue property from a real estate sales brochure she had casually flipped through. ''So I started begging. I just wanted to go and see it.''When they saw the interior two months later, Ms. Krominga, the former general counsel for Revlon, realized it was her dream house. But the Manhattan couple cherished the waterfront getaway they owned on two acres in Remsenburg. They weren't in the market for a new home.''When she starts saying, 'I don't want to buy it,' and she says it seven times, you know that's exactly what she wants,'' Mr. Shiboleth said. ''You don't have to be a magician.''

Mr. Shiboleth, 61, an international lawyer and investor, quietly did some research about the landmark home designed 100 years ago by Wilson Eyre, a prominent Philadelphia architect associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, and the founder and editor of House and Garden magazine, now HG.

From the green Tiffany lamps on the entrance pillars to the wings curved like a warming embrace toward the gravel driveway, the Dutch door and the intricately patterned iron radiator covers, the 9,000-square-foot house oozed character and charm.''It's a big house, but on the other hand you don't get the impression it's big,'' Mr. Shiboleth said, wandering through the sprawling abode, showing off cozy nooks, wainscoting, pocket doors and three stairwells. ''It's very intimate.''He, too, was love-struck. Mr. Shiboleth shelled out more than $3 million for the 3 1/2 acre estate in the winter of 2000 and picked up an adjoining 3 1/2 acre plot the following year for an additional $1 million.Meadowcroft originally stood on 12 waterfront acres, with more than 120 acres across Montauk Highway. Meadowcroft was built for Theodore E. Conklin, who made his fortune in brass and copper, and was occupied by five generations of the Conklin family. The lighting was all done by Louis Comfort Tiffany, whose business was around the corner from the Conklins' in lower Manhattan.Just in time for the home's 100th birthday, Ms. Krominga and Mr. Shiboleth are completing its $2 million restoration, including replacing an asphalt roof with terra cotta tiles that resemble the original and putting two sets of Tiffany sconces found in the basement back on the walls.To celebrate, they commissioned Michael McKenzie, a Manhattan-based author, to research and write ''Meadowcroft: A Century of Elegance in the Hamptons.''''Meadowcroft lyrically is a very good litmus paper for what has happened in the Hamptons for the last 100 years,'' Mr. McKenzie said.

No larger than a McMansion, its high ceilings and large windows are as fashionable as ever. Each of its seven fireplaces is different. ''It's an old house done in a very old-fashioned style, Arts and Crafts, but practically it's very similar to what we believe a house should be right now,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''It doesn't feel like a big white elephant.''Theodore B. Conklin Jr. was born at the gentleman's farm in 1920 and spent every summer of his youth there. While he wintered in Greenwich, Conn., members of the family used Meadowcroft year round.''The house was never closed from the day it was built,'' said Mr. Conklin, who now splits his time between homes in Boca Grande, Fla., and Westhampton Beach. He recalled how the milk was brought over every morning from Meadowcroft's farm.

No matter where they roamed or how many other residences they owned, the Conklin clan considered Meadowcroft home.''It was the anchor,'' said Theodore B. Conklin III, 56, the owner of the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, who spent weekends, summers and vacations on Quantuck Bay but also lived in Manhasset and Manhattan while growing up. ''It certainly gave me a great sense of the value of permanence of a family home that was important to three or four generations of family. These days that gets more and more special.'' Theodore B. Conklin Jr. and his twin brother, Bruce, sold Meadowcroft in 1989.Ms. Krominga and Mr. Shiboleth, who share the home with their daughter, Karen, 11, made some accommodations to 21st-century living. They enclosed the front archway that split the house between the men's billiard and smoking rooms and the living and dining rooms. Bookcases have been added and the smoking room is now a music room. But the throne-like chair with Tiffany glass panels and storage for a badminton set still dominates the veranda.''It's for the princess Lynn,'' Mr. Shiboleth said.A wine cellar and gym were added in the basement, along with a movie theater in the attic. The caretaker's quarters have been moved and the original toolhouse renovated as a guest cottage. But the blanket of fuschia-toned rhododendrons still lines the driveway, while the pool and the Jacuzzi added near the veranda were designed to blend with the mansion's century-old feel.''The idea was, let's bring it back to its old glorious days,'' Mr. Shiboleth said.Keeping the Devil at BayPraising the Lord and the town of Babylon, the Rev. Jimmy Jack and the Rev. Robert Lloyd stood recently in the parking lot of the Freedom Chapel in Amityville. Choir members belted out gospel tunes. Feet tapped, hands clapped, bodies jiggled. Testimonies were recited and hallelujahs filled the morning air as the two ministers, brothers-in-law and suburban evangelists, stuck shovels into the rubble of an open lot at the groundbreaking for a $2 million church.

Behind them was the original Freedom Chapel, a storefront Assemblies of God operation where close to 400 congregants meet weekly in a former warehouse on Route 110 for a rollicking, music-rich worship service.''The sign in the front says a loving church for a hurting generation,'' said Mr. Jack, the senior pastor. ''We are so excited to grab the people of this world, of this community, who are lost, found and have no destiny and no purpose and no hope and give them hope in the future through the love of Jesus Christ.''The new two-story church will have a sanctuary seating 500 to 600 and 12 classrooms to replace the makeshift trailers on the edge of the parking lot. When the new church is complete, the storefront church will be converted to a gym, basketball and recreation center. In the summer, 700 to 800 children attend the church's series of weeklong basketball camps on the parking lot.''We bus in the kids from all the drug-infested areas of Long Island,'' Mr. Jack said. ''We are giving them a sense of self-worth and purpose.''Mr. Jack, 45, of Deer Park, who is white, is executive director of the Long Island arm of an international drug and alcohol rehabilitation program called Teen Challenge. Mr. Lloyd, 58, of Wheatley Heights, who is black, is executive director of Long Island Citizens for Community Values, which fights sexual abuse and pornography. In 1990, they started a local Teen Challenge with an outreach coffeehouse at a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Amityville.''We didn't have a whole lot of money but we had a lot of faith,'' Mr. Jack said.With a $350,000 donation from Jack Toback, a street preacher and a marketer for car dealerships, and his wife, Nancy, from Long Beach, the pastors established a string of six residential homes in Albany, Brentwood, Babylon and West Babylon to minister to troubled souls. They have 65 residents and a staff of 25.Freedom Chapel opened in 1996, attracting members of the community as well as Teen Challenge graduates and converts from tent crusades. Barry Baugh, who is a graduate of the Teen Challenge program, was Mr. Jack's first reclamation success from prison. Mr. Baugh was serving time in the Nassau County Jail for drugs when he was released into Mr. Jack's custody. Mr. Baugh was born again and became a minister at the church.''Our goal is to reach the neighborhood,'' Mr. Lloyd said. ''They are being fed physical food. They are being fed spiritual food. It's about changing people's lives, leading them to the Lord so they can come back here and make the town of Amityville, the Town of Babylon, a wonderful place to live.''
