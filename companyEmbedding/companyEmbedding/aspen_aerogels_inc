	Spaceloft Insulation for Building and Construction













































Overview


Insulation for Building & ConstructionThroughout the Building Envelope - Save Space and Improve Energy Efficiency With Spaceloft® Flexible Aerogel Blanket InsulationFrom the modern high rise to heritage structures and everything in between, the need to conserve energy in our buildings creates a multitude of technical issues for architects and homeowners alike. Common challenges include: Lack of insulation space Dynamic building physics Preserving historical featuresImproving energy efficiency using thick, conventional insulation inevitably requires the surrender of space - and that can potentially impact architectural integrity, lessen living standards for the tenant or reduce investment income for the owner.  In many new build and retrofit projects, poor performing insulation can actually result in damage to an occupant's health or building fabric. In extreme cases, a building can be rendered uninhabitable.Outstanding Thermal Performance for Building ApplicationsFor over 10 years, Spaceloft® aerogel blanket insulation has been the super-insulation material of choice to address heat loss in space challenged environments.

	Spaceloft Insulation for Building and Construction













































Overview


Insulation for Building & ConstructionThroughout the Building Envelope - Save Space and Improve Energy Efficiency With Spaceloft® Flexible Aerogel Blanket InsulationFrom the modern high rise to heritage structures and everything in between, the need to conserve energy in our buildings creates a multitude of technical issues for architects and homeowners alike. Common challenges include: Lack of insulation space Dynamic building physics Preserving historical featuresImproving energy efficiency using thick, conventional insulation inevitably requires the surrender of space - and that can potentially impact architectural integrity, lessen living standards for the tenant or reduce investment income for the owner.  In many new build and retrofit projects, poor performing insulation can actually result in damage to an occupant's health or building fabric. In extreme cases, a building can be rendered uninhabitable.Outstanding Thermal Performance for Building ApplicationsFor over 10 years, Spaceloft® aerogel blanket insulation has been the super-insulation material of choice to address heat loss in space challenged environments.  Spaceloft® has the lowest thermal conductivity of any durable thermal insulation available today.  Its flexible, hydrophobic and breathable format supports use in a wide range of applications including: Walls (internal & external) Floors Ceilings, Dormers and Pitched Roofs Terrace & Balcony Gutter & Soffit Window, door and fenestration inserts Point, repeating & linear thermal bridging treatment Services, ducts, hot water pipeworkVersatile Insulation for Any SpaceSpaceloft® blanket insulation is highly versatile.

	District Energy Insulation for Steam Distribution Networks







































Product Info


District EnergySuperior Insulation for Steam Distribution and District Heating SystemsImproving energy efficiency in our built environment comes with difficult challenges for our energy distribution network.  Traditional thermal insulation materials may force the system operator to choose between energy performance and available space, especially in underground applications.  Variable climate conditions have seen an increase in flooding, which can render many traditional insulation products unsuitable for safe and reliable service in district energy environments. How do district energy operators combat flooded service and the short-comings of traditional insulation? Many have turned to Pyrogel® and Cryogel® insulation. Today, many engineering companies and their clients consider Pyrogel and Cryogel insulation essential components of their process sustainability solutions, corrosion defense, and reliability programs.The best medium- to high-temperature district energy insulationPyrogel insulation is used in medium- to high-temperature steam distribution network service up to 1200ºF (650ºC) where sustained mission critical performance in difficult environments is essential, as in district energy environments. Pyrogel repels liquid yet allows vapor to pass, making it a smart choice where the potential for flooded service exists. This homogeneous resistance to liquid reduces the possibility of uncontrolled condensate and steam formation, protecting workers and the general public alike.Pyrogel insulation’s blanket format supports simplified logistics: A single part number can be used to protect pipework and accessories from condensate to main-steam lines, valves, and vessels.  Pyrogel easily can be pre-cut to shape and delivered to the installation location. The ultra-thin format maximizes worker comfort and improves operator safety in enclosed spaces.Pyrogel insulation has the lowest thermal conductivity of any industrial insulation product. Just 2" (50 mm) of Pyrogel XTE meets existing ASHRAE 90.1’s most stringent heat loss requirements. The equivalent reference insulation requirement is over 5” (125 mm) as shown below. Pyrogel excels in space-challenged environments such as ducts, tunnels and vaults.Thickness comparison to satisfy ASHRAE 90.1 – 2013 requirements for steam pipe

NORTHBOROUGH, Mass., May 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspen Aerogels, Inc. ("Aspen Aerogels") announced today that it was awarded $2.75 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). This funding will be used by Aspen Aerogels over a period of three years to develop a windowpane technology that incorporates a transparent silica aerogel to provide insulation and condensation resistance. This UV-stable silica aerogel layer will be incorporated between two thin transparent sheets of glass to create a double-glazed pane. If successful, Aspen Aerogels' insulated windowpane units could be used to replace single panes in windows where thickness and weight preclude replacement with double-pane units.


"We are very pleased to have been chosen for this award and to be a part of ARPA-E's innovative project portfolio," said Dr. George Gould, Vice President of Research and Development at Aspen Aerogels. "The award will enable us to significantly leverage our investments in development of both revolutionary products and next generation rapid production processes." Aspen Aerogels, a leader in manufacturing aerogel based insulation products and technologies, is partnering on this project with research teams from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who will model and test the novel aerogel window materials against national energy and durability performance standards.
Aspen Aerogels, Inc. received this competitive award from ARPA-E's Single-pane Highly Insulating Efficient Lucid Designs (SHIELD) program, which seeks to reduce heat-loss for improved building efficiency by developing innovative materials that are both transparent and insulating to retrofit existing single-pane windows. Only 14 SHIELD project teams were selected for funding.
In addition to advancing the materials science required to produce highly insulating and transparent aerogel materials, the project team will also investigate rapid aerogel production techniques that are intended to lower the cost to market for transparent window applications while preserving the required optical, thermal and mechanical properties.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
