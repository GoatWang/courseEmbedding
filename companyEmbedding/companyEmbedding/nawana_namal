Max Reinhardt and Namal Nawana/DePuySynthes Spine
DePuySynthes Spine President Replaced
Walter Eisner • Tue, November 27th, 2012
Print this article 

Namal Nawana resigned from his position as worldwide president,  DePuySynthes Spine on November 27. Max Reinhardt,  current vice president,  worldwide marketing,  will be named the new president.
Debbie Williams,  the company’s communications director,  confirmed the news to OTW in an email on the same day.
Namal Nawana
Nawana took the DePuy Spine position in March 2011. Since then,  DePuy merged with Synthes,  Inc. to form DePuySynthes,  the largest orthopedic company in the world. Michel Orsinger,  head of Synthes took over as head of the combined companies.
Nawana began his career as a research engineer at Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1992 before serving as a product development engineer with Howmedica International. He was with Johnson & Johnson and DePuy for more than 15 years,  serving in roles in engineering,  marketing,  sales and general management in Canada.
In 1997,  Nawana joined Johnson & Johnson Orthopaedics as a technical support manager in the UK. He was promoted to sales director,  DePuy Orthopaedics and Trauma,  France and where he led a team that achieved a sales turnaround. In 2004,  Nawana was promoted to general manager for DePuy Canada and later was appointed to lead and build the DePuy business in Australia. When promoted to area vice president of Johnson & Johnson Medical,  Australia and New Zealand in 2009,  he assumed responsibility for MD&D (Medical Devices and Diagnostics) franchises in Australia and New Zealand,  leading a team of over 700.
Williams told OTW that Nawana was pursuing opportunities outside of Johnson & Johnson.
DePuySynthes
Including the Synthes business,  worldwide spine sales for the company was down 3% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 6% during the last quarter. Outside the U.S.,  sales grew approximately 1% operationally.
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson's CFO told analysts on October 16 that since the closing of the deal that united DePuy and Synthes in mid-June,  "Our first priority is no disruption to customers. But the updates that we’re getting tell us that things are moving along just fine. We’re integrating obviously the spine businesses,  because they’re the two businesses that we had that were similar. So that’s where the bulk of the integration is occurring."
"And so far so good. We’re going to take this carefully. We’re going to be measured in the way we do this so that there’s very little disruption if any,  and we’re confident that’s the right way to do it for the long term. The leaders are intact. We’re very pleased to have the Synthes leadership team join Johnson & Johnson,  and as you all know,  Michel Orsinger,  the previous CEO of Synthes now leads our entire combined orthopedics business."
Max Reinhardt
Reinhardt began his career with Johnson & Johnson at DePuy Spine in 2002 as director of sales and marketing in the UK. In 2006,  he relocated to the U.S. as vice president,  U.S. sales for DePuy Spine,  then in early 2011,  assumed the position of vice president,  worldwide marketing for DePuySpine. Earlier this year,  he was appointed to lead the combined DePuySynthes Spine Global Marketing organization.
He earned his Higher National Diploma at Sparsholt College of Agriculture in the UK with a degree in fish farming and fisheries management and his Master of Science degree in marketing from the University of Hull,  also in the UK. He started his career in sales,  marketing and general management roles for medical device companies including Steris and Olympus.

Nawana Named DePuy Spine President
Walter Eisner • Thu, March 17th, 2011
Print this article 




Namal Nawana/DePuy Spine 
DePuy Spine has a new leader.
His name is Namal Nawana. Nawana was appointed to the position of Worldwide President on March 15. He replaces Gary Fischetti,  who was promoted to Company Group Chairman for all DePuy franchises in January.
A company spokesperson told OTW via email that Nawana began his career as a research engineer at Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1992,  then,  serving as a Product Development Engineer with Howmedica International.  He has been with Johnson & Johnson and DePuy for more than 13 years,  serving in roles in Engineering,  Marketing,  Sales and General Management in Canada and ASPAC.
In 1997,  Nawana joined Johnson & Johnson Orthopaedics as a Technical Support Manager in the UK.  He was promoted to Sales Director,  DePuy Orthopaedics and Trauma,  France and where he led a team that achieved a sales turnaround. In 2004,  Namal was promoted to General Manger for DePuy Canada and later was appointed to lead and build the DePuy business in Australia. When promoted to Area Vice President of Johnson & Johnson Medical,  Australia and New Zealand in 2009,  he assumed responsibility for MD&D (Medical Devices and Diagnostics) franchises in Australia and New Zealand,  leading a team of over 700.
He earned Medical Engineering and Master of Medical Science degrees from the University of Adelaide in South Australia and an MBA at Henley Management College in the UK. He also earned a Johnson & Johnson’s Six Sigma PE Black Belt.
Nawana is taking charge of DePuy's spine business at a time of pushback for some spine procedures from payers,  pricing pressure from competitors and a low-single-digit growth rate for the spine market. Some analysts are predicting that market to grow in the 3% to 4% range in 2012.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alere Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Juliet Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Juliet Cunningham - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you.
Good afternoon. Joining us for Alere's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call is Namal Nawana, our CEO and President; and Jim Hinrichs, our EVP and CFO. Both Namal and Jim have prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions.
Our third quarter earnings release and the webcast presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. We'll also post our prepared remarks on our website shortly after the conclusion of this call. As a reminder, this conference call is being webcast live on Wednesday, November 4, 2015. The audio replay of this call will be available on our website through November 11, 2015. And our prepared remarks and earnings presentation will be posted and archived on our IR page.
Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call, including, among others, statements with respect to anticipated future financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2015. Important additional information regarding these forward-looking statements is included in the first slide to the webcast presentation. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties described in our Form 10-K/A, Form 10-Qs and other SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements.
In addition, during this call we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our third quarter earnings release, and is posted on our website.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Namal Nawana, CEO and President of Alere.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Juliet. And thanks to all of you joining us.
Jim will go through our financials in detail shortly. But I'm going to focus on three key topics this afternoon. First I'll discuss our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance, focusing mainly on revenue composition. Then I'll review our business unit results, including major product and market drivers. And finally I'll report our progress on key initiatives and plans that support Alere's success heading into 2016 and beyond. I'll be referencing some of the slides we've included in our earnings presentation, available on our website.
Beginning with our third quarter performance. Revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share were below our expectations at $602 million and $0.54, respectively. As you can see in our earnings presentation on slide three, compared to the prior year period, revenue declined by $33 million in foreign currency exchange, $13 million in Pain Management and $8 million in INRatio, $9 million from BBI revenue and lower sales into our consumer joint venture, and $9 million in CD4 and Malaria products sold in Africa.

Organic growth declined a negative 1.7% during the third quarter. Excluding Pain Management, organic growth was 0.3%. Despite these challenges, our core businesses had solid growth with increased sales in core platforms and services. From a global region perspective, Latin America grew organically by 19% year-over-year. Asia-Pacific grew 5%, Africa declined 12%, Europe declined 4%, and North America declined by 2%. Excluding Pain Management, North America grew by 1.2%. Jim will provide additional color of regional results later in the call.
Now, I'd like to review the business performance in each of our three core business units. Unless otherwise noted, all growth figures are on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and dispositions.
Beginning with our Cardiometabolic business, which grew organically by 4.3%, Q3 revenue was $208 million, and was driven by 15% growth in Asia and 2% growth in North America. From a product perspective, Afinion continues to perform well, with approximately 1425 placements during Q3 including large hospital placements in North America. Overall, Afinion A1C grew 26% globally in Q3.
Epoc grew 23% as we fulfilled backorders and began adding new customers and expanding our presence further into the emergency department and other parts of the hospital. Patients on testing grew 12% and meter-based Triage grew in excess of 10%. This growth was offset by a lower INRatio in LDX cholesterol product sales.
Our Infectious Disease business generated Q3 revenue of $164 million dollars, a 3.9% decline in organic growth. The decrease in organic growth compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by a 7% decline in Europe and a 13% decline in Africa. Africa declined due to lower CD4 and Malaria sales. In the case of CD4, the WHO recommended that doctors and clinicians prioritize viral load to monitor the success of antiretroviral therapy, but also acknowledged the need to include CD4 if viral load is not routinely available and also to help stratify risk. Given that point of care CD4 is lower cost, more accessible, and it provides connectivity through the cellular networks we continue to believe that our paying with (6:17) CD4 remains a key tool to improve health outcomes. The change in guidelines has created some uncertainty in the CD4 market, but we expect CD4 sales to return to growth in 2016.
Secondly, we've seen many opportunities to convert lab based CD4 testing to point of care in the HIV market. Malaria sales in Africa have also been impacted by the timing of tender shipments, which tend to fluctuate, and also continued pricing pressure. While we don't see pricing pressure abating in the near term we have new Malaria innovations in the pipeline that we believe will help mitigate the current pricing environment and deliver better economics in the future.
Turning now to flu, global flu sales had a solid quarter with organic growth of 18% versus the prior year period. Total global flu sales in Q3 were $20 million including $5 million in Alere i. The focus of our sales force in Q3 was to get Alere i in place ahead of the flu season, and they did that admirably. We've now achieved more than 2800 instrument placements around the world year-to-date. And we believe we'll exit the year with greater than 4,000 instrument placements. This sets the stage nicely for future kit revenue, whether it's for flu, strep or any other future analytes.
I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize the Alere i team for a job very well done. With their hard work we've added large hospital groups and networks to our Alere i customer roster, and we estimate the competitive conversions were 43% year-to-date. In addition, we estimate that about 20% of new Alere i customers were doctors and clinicians who previously didn't test for flu, but are now realizing the benefits of rapid molecular diagnostics at the point of care to improve patient health outcomes. We've had a very positive customer response. And we believe that we are well positioned to lead in the point of care molecular tests on our new multi-analyte platforms.

Importantly, we've now completed the automation of our Alere i manufacturing line. And this, coupled with scaling volumes, will help substantially lower our COGS in future quarters. Just last quarter we added strep A to the menu, the first sales in Q3. And we now expect Alere i strep sales to ramp steadily. Also during Q3 we received clearance to use our Alere i flu assay with viral transport medium. And this additional claim enables us to better serve our hospital customers. In addition, we expect to enter clinical trials to expand the Alere i menu with RSV in the fourth quarter of this year. We're also making excellent progress on C. difficile and chlamydia/gonorrhea as new analytes.
Global HIV sales grew 2.9%, driven by solid growth in Asia-Pacific and strong demand for our Determine Combo products in the U.S. In addition, we've shipped over $1 million in Alere q products over the past two quarters, and are excited about the opportunity for this point-of-care molecular platform going forward.
Moving now to our Global Toxicology business, Q3 revenue was $163 million, a 3% year-over-year decrease and was driven by pain management, which declined 63% from the prior year period. Excluding pain management, our core toxicology revenue grew by 6% during Q3, which represents 10 consecutive quarters of organic growth.
Our efforts to stabilize Pain Management have not yielded the desired results. Despite Q3 being the first quarter to show stabilized lab volumes, we continue to have payment pressure. The national payer we contracted with in July has not yet ramped volume and other contracting efforts have stalled as the market awaits a final pricing determination from CMS.
As you may be aware, CMS released its preliminary determination for the clinical lab fee schedule, but the recommendations will not be finalized until November. This remains a very turbulent period in the pain management market segment, as evidenced by continued pricing pressure and numerous competitors exiting the market. We've closely monitored this business and have cut costs wherever possible. At the same time, we have evaluated strategic alternatives to pain management throughout the year, and we'll continue to do so. Pain Management now represents less than 5% of total toxicology revenue and less than 1% of Alere revenue.
Switching gears to our core Toxicology business, organic growth drivers included our global Reagents business, which increased by 13% and employer services, which grew 8% year-over-year. In our Reagents business we achieved two additional 510(k) clearances during Q3, including EDDP, a methadone metabolite and PCP, a drug of abuse. As you recall, we previously cleared six drugs, bringing our year-to-date clearances now to eight. We continue to pursue key clearances to improve our portfolio and now have the building blocks to enter the regulated workplace and hospital markets. We will approach this new market early in Q4, and expect a strong launch with key laboratory and trade partners in early 2016.
In employer services we expanded our reach to more than 3,700 eScreen enabled clinics, adding approximately 120 new clinic partner locations. We signed approximately $2 million in national account wins with large employers and third party administrators, which are now working to onboard in Q4. Finally, in July we announced the acquisition of US Diagnostics, a leading provider of drug tests in the U.S. The integration has proceeded well, and we're already seeing the anticipated financial returns from this acquisition. Our Toxicology team is looking forward to an active fourth quarter as they implement multiple product and customer wins. And we still expect to return to overall revenue growth in Q4.
Lastly, I want to take a step back and share some thoughts with you on our progress to date and priorities going forward, because in times of volatility it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. We are in the process of transforming Alere to be a world-class global enterprise. We've sharpened our focus on core products, removed more than $100 million in costs, and reported three consecutive quarters of organic growth prior to the third quarter. As you can see on slide four, the operational discipline being exerted by the organization is evident when analyzing the trailing 12 months operating expense trends, which normalize the seasonal revenue variance.

Although we face significant revenue challenges in Q3, we've demonstrated our ability to exercise strong expense management discipline, which contributed to a 54% increase in non-GAAP adjusted EPS compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date we delivered non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $1.62 per diluted share from continuing operations and organic growth of 1.3%.
As we continue to focus our business on Rapid Diagnostics, we are pleased to report that we are on track to close the BBI divestiture this quarter, and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and redeploying capital appropriately. We continue to pursue the divestiture of SPD, a consumer joint venture with P&G ,and the litigation we discussed previously is now progressing in a positive direction for SPD. Based on these developments, we expect to move forward with the SPD disposition in 2016. We also continue to pursue the divestiture of other non-core assets to reduce our debt.
With that as a backdrop, I'll provide our revised guidance. Based on our current business outlook, we expect 2015 revenue to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.5 billion dollars, and non-GAAP adjusted EPS of between $2.20 and $2.25 per diluted share. Full year adjusted non-GAAP EPS growth year on year would therefore be in the 19% to 22% range.
Finally, looking longer term, we believe the financial thesis for Alere remains fully intact. We've done the checks and firmly believe that our markets are still growing organically in the mid-single digits, and we fully expect to return the company to organic revenue growth in Q4 and next year. Further, between product mix and a multitude of margin enhancement projects, there are significant multi-year leverage opportunities throughout our P&L.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. Thanks very much Namal.
Good evening, everyone. I've got two topics that I want to cover today. First, I'll review the third quarter financials. I'll provide color on various drivers, and then I'll discuss some of the key financial initiatives that are underway to improve long term profitability at Alere. But before I get into the details, I want to stop and give you what I think are the three key financial takeaways from the third quarter.
First and most obviously, third quarter revenue, and therefore earnings, were below our expectations. The primary drivers of this revenue shortfall were misses in Africa, Asia and a few of our non-core, soon to be divested businesses. We understand these misses and do expect to bounce back in the fourth quarter, which I'll describe shortly.
Second, is the restructuring and cost base improvements that the team instituted last year continued to yield measurable and visible results, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter, with operating expense discipline driving strong leverage to the bottom line for the full year. This phenomena will persist despite lower than expected revenues.
And finally, we've reset our fourth quarter and full year 2015 expectations, which are very achievable, and we're pushing very hard to finish the year strong with positive momentum going into 2016.
So moving to the third quarter numbers, please note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results unless otherwise specified. And for comparison purposes, you'll find a full reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP in our third quarter 2015 press release on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Net revenue for the third quarter was $602 million. That compares to $649 million in the prior year period. The 7.3% or $47 million year-on-year decrease was primarily driven by a negative foreign exchange impact of $33 million, a $13 million decrease in Pain Management, $9 million in lower sales of BBI and sales into our consumer joint venture, and $9 million in CD4 and Malaria sales in Africa. Partly offsetting these declines were year-on-year increases in cardiac markers, patient self-testing, Afinion, Epoc and core Toxicology.

If we look beyond the year-on-year variances, I suspect that many are asking what changed for the third quarter versus what we expected 90 days ago. As I noted in my summary comments, the shortfall versus our recent expectations came primarily from Africa, Asia and select non-core businesses.
More specifically, in Africa, as Namal mentioned, changing CD4 guidelines, as well as delayed tenders and price competition in the malaria market hurt third quarter sales. We do expect fourth quarter to be a much stronger number in Africa with CD4 and Malaria products bouncing back a bit, and sales of HIV products filling the rest of the gap.
With respect to Asia, the shortfall in China was driven by economic volatility which caused some distributor destocking. Korea has the hangover effect of the MERS outbreak, which dampened overall utilization in that country. Notwithstanding those issues, we expect Q4 to be a much better overall number in Asia with China, Japan and India leading the way.
And finally, looking at our non-core or Other revenue, the shortfall was primarily due to sales in our consumer JV, which carry very low margins, and BBI revenue declines. As you know, this business is scheduled to be divested later this quarter.
Continuing with third quarter revenue, Professional Diagnostic revenue of $580 million was comprised of $208 million in Cardiometabolic Disease, $164 million in Infectious Disease, $163 million in Toxicology, $45 million in Other revenue, which reflected the divestiture of BioNote, DGP and Alere Analytics. Consumer Diagnostic revenue was $19 million, and License and Royalty revenue was $3 million in the third quarter. From a geographic split standpoint, 59% of our revenue from the quarter came from North America, 17% from Europe, 14% from Asia-Pacific and 10% from the rest of the world.
Now looking at gross margins, adjusted gross profit was $293 million, with a 48.5% gross margin in the quarter. That compares to $324 million with a 49.8% gross margin in the year ago period. The two biggest headwinds by far continue to be foreign exchange, especially the significant negative currency moves we saw in Latin America and Asia. And product mix again primarily due to lower contribution from the high margin Pain Management business. These are the same trends we've been discussing all year, and compared to the second quarter, gross margin remained relatively stable sequentially.
Looking at expenses, adjusted operating expenses totaled $187 million, 31% of net revenue, that's down 10% year on year. Adjusted operating expenses were comprised of $27 million in R&D, and $160 million in SG&A, which were 4.5% and 26.5% of revenue, respectively. The modest increase that we saw in R&D from the second quarter run rate was expected and reflects continued build out of project management capability, and investment in our critical projects. SG&A went down quarter over quarter primarily as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, and continued cost controls around discretionary spend on things like travel and expenses, as well as consultants.
Moving down to P&L, adjusted operating income was $105 million in the third quarter, a 10% year on year decline, and adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 17.5% of net revenue. Adjusted interest and other expense was $38 million in the third quarter versus $60 million last year, driven by lower interest expense from debt pay down and our June refinancing as well as realized foreign exchange losses that did not repeat this year. Those were losses from last year.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $135 million and our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 28.4%, largely in line with our expectations and significantly below last year's rate.

Finishing up on the P&L. Thanks to the lower interest and tax expense adjusted net income from continuing operations increased 61% year on year to $48 million or $0.54 per diluted share, with diluted common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter of 100.8 million.
Turning to balance sheet and cash flow. As of September 30, we had $479 million in cash, $2.7 billion of debt net of cash. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $105 million. Free cash flow was $84 million. This is an improvement over the first half of the year as a result of higher net and continued focus on better working capital management.
We're still a bit behind last year though, and we continue to push to get our full year free-cash flow number, even with last year's number, of approximately $120 million. As a reminder, this is a high bar as it includes cash flow from discontinued operations of approximately $30 million. Finally as Namal said, we expect BBI to close shortly, and that should bring in another $117 million of cash in the fourth quarter.
Now looking toward the fourth quarter and the full year, Namal provided our revised guidance range of approximately $2.48 billion to $2.50 billion on the top line, and between $2.20 and $2.25 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share. Although we only provide annual financial guidance at this stage in the year with only one quarter remaining, it seems reasonable that we do the math, and tell you that our full year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue in the range of $640 million to $660 million, and our non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.59 to $0.64 in the fourth quarter.
Now although these results in the fourth quarter are a step up from Q3, which reflects normal seasonality at Alere, they're clearly achievable, and we feel we've got good line of sight to them. We're approaching the fourth quarter aggressively to help ensure that we achieve these results. More specifically both Namal and I are personally taking steps to ensure resources and direction of Alere of the key markets that will make or break the fourth quarter. In addition, we are proactively targeting discretionary spend with reductions in travel and expenses, outside consulting and non-revenue generating new hires.
Now as I mentioned, I want to finish by sharing some thoughts on the longer term underlying cost drivers, and the potential for continued enterprise light profit improvement. Last quarter, I said that we see the potential to systematically remove tens of millions of dollars in cost over time as we simplify Alere and manage the company as one global enterprise. And since then, we've continued to work on these opportunities, which will come through strategic initiatives in things like pricing, global procurement, IT and corporate infrastructure simplification, our internal operating and service delivery models better treasury and tax planning, and a host of other things.
Now these are obviously multi-year initiatives, but we've already realized some small quick wins in a number of these. We've built capabilities and made changes to the way we look at pricing and discounting. We've hired a Chief Procurement Officer and initiated a true global strategic sourcing effort. We've consolidated and now have access to tens of millions of dollars in cash, and we brought in a new tax leader and team to build our internal tax accounting and planning capabilities, which we expect will drive better long term results.
We expect all these things to contribute meaningfully to our results in 2016 and beyond. Most importantly, we've initiated work on a broader corporate wide simplification project designed to find complexity and drive it out of the organization. We believe this effort will benefit all of our stakeholders by making it easier for our customers to do business with us and ultimately drive a more profitable enterprise for our shareholders. We're in the early stages of this journey, and we plan to share our longer term targets and metrics as a result of this work in early 2016.

Finally, I want to take the opportunity to thank all the Alere employees around the globe for their hard work and helping us achieve the vision for Alere. Without the great people here, none of what we're trying to do would be possible. And so with that, I think we can open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. First question comes from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead, sir.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Yeah. Good afternoon. Jim so just trying to understand a little bit more some of the moving parts in the quarter as how you're thinking about them going forward. When you ran through a litany of things that were worse than expected in terms of revenue, but on a number of those things you said you expected them to get better in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter guidance doesn't seem to imply a lot of improvement, no growth really year-over-year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is should we – to what extent should we be thinking about this Q3 as an anomaly related to timing and some of the other factors that you related versus a new base of which we should be thinking about sequential and year-over-year growth going forward? And then I have a follow-up question.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So first of all, thanks, Bill. Let me start and then I'm sure Jim will add a couple of things here. So we did have some discrete areas which performed worse than our expectations. And certainly even late into the quarter we expected them to do better than they actually ended up delivering, particularly Africa and Asia in this case. I think you know we've had Pain Management and INRatio as headwinds throughout the year. Pain Management we had thought would remediate more than it did in Q3 ultimately. We signed a national payer. But – and we stabilized volumes. But we certainly didn't see the actual payments come through in any significant way. So we had price pressure essentially there.
So thinking about the moving parts going forward, I think again we feel good about our Africa business having a stronger Q4. We have good line of sight to the pipeline of contracts and tenders there. And so that seems to be something that should flow back in Q4. We also see Asia accelerating again. I think we had great growth in India again in Q3. But China was at a much lower level than usual, 5% growth. A lot of turbulence in that marketplace during the quarter. And we do anticipate that will come back.
I think the broader question is how do we get to the mid-single digit growth of our markets? And that's something we feel again good about getting to during the course of 2016. But we still have some of these headwinds persisting in Q4. So we're being, I think, naturally conservative after the Q3 results. With respect to our Q4 expectations we certainly want to deliver at stronger organic growth levels. But I think that we'd be looking into 2016 for that now.
Jim, do you want to add anything?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No. I think that's pretty much summarized. One thing I'd say, Bill, is you know the things that we identified, those three critical things, they were – they're pretty compartmentalized. We have good visibility in them. We do expect a bounce back in the fourth quarter. In terms of growth in the fourth quarter we do expect to grow the company organically in the fourth quarter, which we did not do in the third. So we're going to be getting back to organic growth, much like we did in the first and the second quarter. And you can see what our guidance range implies.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC

Okay. So you do expect positive organic growth in the fourth quarter. Okay. That – and then just to follow up, I mean are any of these issues at all related or fallout potentially from any of the cost-saving initiatives that have gone on? And is there anywhere where now looking at it you have perhaps underinvested or overcut? Or are they really more macro environmental issues versus operational issues?
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So first of all, no. I don't think they relate to the cost saving measures we've taken, which again were very specific. A lot coming in R&D initially as well as in G&A functions. And I think that, again, they captured in fairly discrete areas. We've got Africa where we've actually invested in feet on the street. And we do anticipate growth going forward really related to two product groups, CD4 and Malaria there. And then in Asia, which I think is much more timing oriented and that's I think a Q3 issue more than anything else. We have won tenders which we anticipate will drive growth going forward. So I don't think it's a question of us under investing. I think that we've still got actually much more opportunity on the OpEx line going forward. And we will make select investments for growth in all of our geographies based on our normal business planning process, which really is underway at the moment and finalizes as we get through the year.
William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. Thanks.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

And our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to sort of ask a similar question in a different way, which is to say you guys are obviously making a series of important investments in the infrastructure of the company. A lot of it will hopefully improve forecasting. If you were to maybe hypothetically imagine a world where you had a lot of this infrastructure in place, is it fair to say that a lot of the issues that caught you by surprise this quarter could've been maybe more visible? I'm just trying to get a sense of the extent to which you think that what happened this quarter was a function of just not having the controls you need in place to forecast effectively.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. Great question, Isaac, thanks. And I think the short answer – I mean a couple things. First is, the word, control, has a very specific meaning in finance. And so I think we have a well controlled close and a well controlled financial reporting process. When it comes to forecasting that's a different matter. And so let's talk about forecast accuracy.
I will tell you that this company has been run for a long, long time with a series of smaller entities that rolled up and so therefore the information flow was sometimes scattered. We are in the process, as Namal and I have talked about, of converting to more of a global view and a global enterprise view of things. We've instituted a number of new processes in place that I think makes it better. And so a couple months ago we instituted a monthly financial review with all the executives and all the finance leadership that probes much more deeply into the monthly results and what that means for the forecast. And that was, like I said, instituted just a short time ago. It was not part of the Q3 forecasting process. And so I think we're getting better on that front. I think the information flow is definitely getting better globally.
And so I think the short answer to your question is, as we continue to invest in some of these global infrastructure type things, and as we continue to look at the company more globally, we will have better visibility. I also will tell you though, within two or three weeks of the quarter ending we were still contemplating a much higher revenue number than got reported. And a couple of these last – a couple of things changed in the last two or three weeks of the quarter that took the number down below, well below what we were expecting, even with only a few weeks left. So that was definitely a change towards the end of the quarter. That possibly could've been picked up, but not sure – it was better infrastructure, but not sure that we would've been able to do too much about it at that point.

The long-winded way of saying, yes, we are investing. Yes, our visibility is getting better. It's better now than it was six months ago or a year ago. And it will get better over the course of the next couple of quarters.
The last thing I'll say is very tactically that sometimes not having great harmonized systems is an excuse. That should not be an excuse. We are absolutely using what I describe as good, old-fashioned person-to-person contact. And Namal and I are participating on weekly calls with many of the go-to-market leaders in the regions that are very important for us to make our fourth quarter. And we're staying very tightly abreast of what's happening in each of those regions. So we're trying to make up for it with just a little bit of old-fashioned discussion.
Namal, anything to add?
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Look, I think you covered it. But one thing I would add is I'd emphasize the accountability. We – this is not the revenue result we were planning for. And in real terms, had we achieved just flat organic growth I think we would've delivered and over-delivered on our earnings calls. And so the miss is very disappointing. I think it is – we understand it. I think the team is extremely engaged in reversing this and getting to market growth, which we absolutely believe we can deliver.
So I think as much as the forecasting is an area of opportunity for us to improve, the biggest area is actually delivering and delivering the performance. And as we planned our financial year, we certainly did not plan for going backwards in this quarter, and I think we have to be accountable to that. And again, in terms of managing risk for our company and making sure that we can be there, we had anticipated at least flat. I'll say more than that, but at least flat. Had we got to at least flat, I think that the earnings result would've been certainly in line. So that's all I would add there, Isaac.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey, I appreciate all the color. That's very helpful. Maybe one follow-up, more tactically on the Infectious Disease business. You guys didn't call out flu; obviously the trend that we've seen elsewhere in the industry quarter to date suggests sort of a so-so quarter. Can you comment on if that presented (35:25) a tough comp or a headwind for Infectious Disease? Thank you.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So great question. We've seen some of the reporting. There is the GHX reporting that occurs November 10th-ish, so we'll see formally then on market shares, et cetera. Now, from my standpoint, we're tracking pretty much how we expected to in Flu. Our focus in this quarter was really around getting our Alere i asset in place. I think we did that very, very well. We now have over 2,800 Alere i's placed ahead of the flu season.
So what you're seeing in the flu market at the moment is really customers preparing for the flu season and buying in to have the necessary stocks on their shelves. For us, that was a fairly normal quarter. Yes, we had 18% growth overall, but it's about the same when you add the Alere i flu in, as what we experienced last year. So rather than – the only shift we anticipate is that as Q4 and Q1 come around, in a normal flu season scenario, we anticipate doing a little better with Alere i out there, and that is certainly something we would forecast.
But in terms of the size of the flu season, we're not calling the size of flu season. Typically we have to wait until kind of week 50 to see whether there's been an inflection in the reported rates. If we haven't seen it by about week 50, then we tend to think that it's going to be a lighter season. But until then, we don't really call it.

Our next question comes from Dane Leone from BTIG. Please go ahead, Dane.

Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I do appreciate the level of detail, given the challenging quarter. When we break down the revenue misses, it seems like the consumer business is on the track to be divested by BBI, on the track to be divested really within the core areas, it's mostly in the CD4 and the Malaria business. Can you help us kind of differentiate the confidence that you have in some of the core businesses rebounding in the fourth quarter against the commentary that you gave that you guys were caught off guard in the last two to three weeks of the third quarter?
So what I mean by that is you're obviously looking at trends for the first month of the fourth quarter to give you confidence that you can hit the numbers that you just laid out. How does that differentiate then being caught off guard perhaps late in the quarter versus your expectations?
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's a great question, Dane. Let me get you started on this and Jim can add. Yes. BBI is being divested, though we're a little shorter than we expected this quarter, and as was SPD. Heading into Q4 as we look on a sequential basis, so kind of bridging up from our Q3 results to our Q4 anticipated result, we do anticipate the flu will have a bigger part in that quarter, that financial cycle. I think everyone knows that.
We also anticipate a rebound in Africa. That's only going to be a moderate rebound in CD4 and Malaria. We think really CD4 will be 2016 to get back to the kind of growth that we had been experiencing. But HIV has been doing really, really well for us. We're at 9% year-to-date growth in our HIV screening, and that's really on the back of both Determine and well as that fantastic launch for Determine Combo in the U.S. where we've been seeing really wonderful success. So HIV I think the Screening business will do well in Q4 and heading forward.
And 23% growth on our Epoc range in Q3 is good growth. It's not as good as we think it should be. And so we think that that will contribute more in Q4. A lot of good opportunities for our sales organization at the moment. So I think a lot of focus on Alere i, I think in Q4. We've already really got Alere i set where we want it, and anticipating about 4,000 placements by the end of the year. But Epoc I think is a big opportunity. Great momentum in Afinion, 26% growth for our (40:04). That continues to really drive.
And then core Toxicology, you know 6% growth in the quarter, obviously with Pain Management it's a real bit of a downer overall, but the core Toxicology is 10 straight quarters of good growth, good organic growth. And again we anticipate particularly Reagents and Employer Services doing well into Q4. So I'd say across the board many of our core platforms did perform in Q3, and many of our plans, most of our plans were well executed in Q3 but these areas that did surprise us were of significant enough size that we're now overcome in the quarter. But Q4, I'd say, they're the key things I call out.
Any I missed?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I wouldn't add to the detail. I think that's right in terms of where the pockets of growth are going to come from and where the rebound is going to come from. And we said that in our script and then again in this answer. I think one of the things you asked about was how do we avoid a surprise? And so as I mentioned, we're much more involved, just personally involved in these things, and you'd be amazed at the kind – what we're trying to do actually is de-risk the month of December and try to drive as much sales as we can into the early part of the quarter.
Certainly, we are part of the way through the fourth quarter. And the guidance we've given reflects our insights into the quarter, thus far. And then the last thing, I'd say is again, the personal involvement, you'd be surprised or amazed or maybe you wouldn't on when the CEO is the personally involved in talking to country managers and sales leaders about how they're doing, the sense of urgency lifts. And so I think that's an important component as well, not to say that it's not always urgent, not to say that we're not in touch with it all the time. But when you're doing something every week and the CEO is touching people every single week, it just creates a heightened sense of awareness that I think is important right now for the company.

So between the detail that Namal gave and the product rebounds and the process that we're implementing, I think you've got a little bit of color as to how we're hoping the fourth quarter is considerably better than the third.
Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Great color. Maybe, just one follow-up on China. Given this lower sales growth there, I think you guys mentioned specifically, it was distributor inventory destocking. What did you see in sell out versus sell in? So where the sell out rates were good, that maybe the sell in was just a temporal response to reduce some inventory levels and then things will go back to normal?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I don't have that number directly in front of me but when we spoke to the country manager and the region manager, we were – it was very clear that the economic uncertainty that has prevailed in China while they don't believe that there's a fundamental reduction in demand for our products, it's pretty clear that some of these distributors, many of whom are smaller distributors, are not eager to outlay capital to buy inventory and in fact are bleeding inventory down. So I don't have the exact in versus sell in versus sell out number in front of me but that was a very clear topic of great discussion in our discussion with them about their quarterly results.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And I have made comments about China and Alere in the past and I'll make them again which is I think that what China needs, Alere has, relevant products and we are underpenetrated overall. So I think our outlook on an annual basis for China always remains positive, and on a go-forward basis also. And we're still at early stages with new assets like Epoc in that market. So I think we're in the process of just changing the profile of how we derive our revenue, how we access our customers in China. And I'm confident that our team there will do well over time and build our capability.

Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Anthony Charles Petrone - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. And good afternoon. Maybe just a couple to jump in again on CD4 and Malaria. If I'm hearing you correctly, either Namal or Jim, on the Malaria side specifically. It sounds like there was a combination of share shift, but perhaps slippage. So is part of the Malaria experience in the quarter, was that actually slippage? And do you expect to get that back in the fourth quarter? And then just on Other revenue, I'm just wondering if you can break out what the impact of moving to discontinued operations is on that line item. And so is this sort of the run rate that we should expect going forward? And then just one follow-up on EPS. Thanks.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So I think we'll just jump in and out here, Jim.
But for Malaria I think there was a little bit of slippage in the quarter. And we'll see a little bit change in Q4. But I would say the main thing is that we have lost price in Malaria. And that price pressure is relevant to understand. It's probably a little more than we anticipated. And I think most importantly, we would've anticipated a bigger offset of incoming volume to offset that price in our initial plans. And so what is our outlook going forward? Again I would say the need for malaria tests is great. You know there's still so much to do in that field. And I think that volumes will continue to go up over the coming months and years. And equally from our standpoint we're part of the process which is trying to eradicate that disease over a longer time horizon. But to do that you need a more higher sensitivity test.

So I think the real thing is to solve the problem we need to have better tests. We're in the process of doing that. And it's not too down in the future where we'll have a new product with a different price I think to address that market. In the short term I think continued pricing pressure, but offset by volume. So our job is to make sure that we're winning the tenders and bringing in the volume. And for the remainder of the questions...
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
On Other revenue, right, Anthony? And what...
Anthony Charles Petrone - Jefferies LLC
Yeah, correct. On discontinued ops. Is this sort of the run rate we should expect going forward?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. So that Other revenue category, the one that we reported about $45 million, which was down about $20 million year-on-year, that – it's actually not a disc ops line. It's basically just sort of a mish mash of assorted things that don't fit anywhere else. And many of those, to your very good point, are in the process of being divested. And so that line will likely continue to shrink. So if you look at the $45 million we reported, that has got some obvious negative pressure from divestitures of businesses that were in last year's results that aren't in this year's results.
In addition, it contains BBI, which will close in the fourth quarter. So it will decline even further from that number into the fourth quarter. And then as we continue to divest smaller businesses that that line will continue to shrink probably, well definitely, through 2016. So I actually don't have a very precise estimate to give you for the fourth quarter, because it depends a lot on when we actually close the BBI transaction, but it will definitely be lower in the fourth quarter.
Anthony Charles Petrone - Jefferies LLC
That's helpful. Then just the last one in the EPS guide, it seems that the prior range was sort of $2.40 to $2.50, a lot of moving parts on divestitures, and then the issues in infectious disease. I'm just wondering if you could sort of quantify what is divested businesses in that EPS shift versus what occurred in the underlying business? Thanks again.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. So there's a couple of moving parts, as you suggested, the divestiture of BBI and then the offset with the acquisition of USD, which was an acquisition we closed in July. So I think net-net, again, not knowing precisely when BBI will close, there is somewhere on the net of those two is somewhere between a $0.02 and $0.04 loss of EPS to the company in this year's number. And that's the only significant divestiture that would impact the guidance this year, those net.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And the reason for the BBI one contributing to that Q4 I think decline further relates to its performance also, which is understood, understood by the potential acquirer and – but measurable. To the earlier point, on the disc ops, I think we've done the appropriate cleanup of the business, and I think it's – we feel good about the measures taken. So a small business like BioNote that we sold last year, they do contribute to a revenue decline. Other small businesses like our German health management business, they did have some revenue attached to them, some significant revenue attached. But they did not have a lot of earnings attached to them. So we've been able to protect I think the earnings line well, despite some of those decisions.
Anthony Charles Petrone - Jefferies LLC

And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Hey guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but thinking about that new range of $2.20 to $2.25, if BBI is only out for two months of that quarter and you're talking about $0.02 or $0.03 of potential dilution. What's the base that we should be thinking about to grow our models for 2016 to make sure that we're thinking about that appropriately? Because the fear would be growth off of a number that's not quite the real number as the portfolio will be constructed for 2016.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Great, great question. Obviously we'll provide you that kind of reconciliation as we get towards the end of the year. The one thing I will tell you is BBI's performance is backend loaded. And so a lot of their earnings do come in towards the end of the year. That's what we've seen traditionally out of them. And so actually losing them in November/December has a disproportionate share. It's not like one-sixth of their contribution goes away. It's something more than that in general. So again, I think if you think about year-on-year what we might be losing, if you took that number that I gave you and kind of doubled it and said that might be a starting place that might be a good starting place. We're going to give you a much more detailed reconciliation when we give guidance next year for the full year of 2016. Okay?
Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then secondly, looking at some of the disclosures between segment gross profit margins, it actually looked like your Other businesses and corporate had negative gross margin if I – or gross profit dollars, if I'm reading this correctly. Because it looked like the professional diagnostic segment, at least according to the reconciliation, had about $305 million of GP. But the entire company had $292 million. And historically that's not the case. Usually the PDX (51:20) number is slightly below the consolidated number. So was there something in there that we should be thinking about?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You know what, Nick, let me and Juliet take that and dig into it and get you an answer back. I don't have that at the tip of my tongue right now. The split of gross margin and expenses between the segments is largely allocation based. And so answering it on the fly is probably not the best thing here. Why don't we – Juliet and I will take that question. We'll dig into it and we'll get you an answer just as quick as we can.
Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And then, just two quick ones more. Given the size of the delta relative to the kind of existing guidance, did you guys think at all about pre-announcing, considering the level of miss here? Or were you trying to figure out what October looked like to give you a better sense of how to come out with guidance?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. That's a great question. We did discuss it. You know I think the conclusion was when you have a miss you want to make sure you've got the best possible information, both on the reasons for the miss and also what it means going forward. And so we used all of the time to the best of our ability to figure that out. We spent a lot of time talking to the regional leaders, a lot of time talking to the business – global business unit leaders, and a lot of time pressure testing both our short term and long term assumptions about this business, and a lot of time looking at what we can do on the expense line.
And also, more time in October to try to get a sense of where the quarter was going. So I just gave a long-winded answer to your assumption which is yeah, we wanted to take as much time as we could to get the best information possible. And that's why we chose to take it all the way up to the normal earnings release date.

Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then lastly, in terms of the initiatives that Jim, you started to embark on, or the whole team started to embark on regarding margin improvements, strategic pricing, tax planning. If we think about those impacts over the next kind of three years, how should we be thinking about the quarterly allocation of that? I know you'll probably give more in depth color when you guys are at the JPMorgan conference or at an Analyst Day at some point in the first quarter, but just wanted to get a better sense of the cadence of the margin improvement that you think is inherent in this business, because clearly with the reset today, I think investors would try to hope that we don't have another reset happening in a couple months. Thanks.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. That's a great question. I think I'm going to defer until we've got a deeper laid back project expectations on our three year strategic plan, which we're in the process of working through right now, as well as our 2016 budget, which we're in the process of working on now. So, a lot of moving parts here inside the company and we'll have way better information on all of those things in 90 days or 120 days.
The one thing I would tell you just to temper expectations, I would not expect that we'll give you sort of quarterly cadence on when we'll see margin rollout. I think what we'd like to do is give you long term targets, and then measure progress against them. And that's kind of the way I think we'd like to handle it. But at the very least, hopefully early next year, you'll get some of those longer term targets.
Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you.

And our next question comes from Zarak Khurshid from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi there, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a multi-parter on Malaria to start. We haven't heard too much about that business over the years. I was just wondering if you could break out how large of a business is that for you? What's sort of the underlying organic growth that you've seen? What's the nature of the pricing pressure there? Is it essentially government purchasers that play various vendors off of each other to secure better pricing, or is there some other dynamic?
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So Malaria has been a growing business for us. We experienced really strong growth last year, and I think that's one of the issues here is the massive tender wins last year and strong comparables. But since then, I think that there's also been a response from our competitors in the marketplace, and also, specifically with respect to price. So this year what we're seeing is that volume growth being tapped and the price pressure being much more acute.
So, I would say that the outlook remains one of strong volume growth based on need. And the – and continued price pressure in the near term with respect to competitors trying to maintain a business. We have – this is a sizable business for us on any given quarter. And during the course of last year I think we're probably north of $70 million in malaria tests. I'd have to check the exact number.
Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks for that color. And then you talk about your continued optimism around organic growth. Given the reset to the EPS guidance here, what's your view on the free cash flow? Is that being impacted more or less than the EPS here? And any color on free cash flow going forward would be helpful.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Yeah. I think the short answer is it's probably being impacted less. I think the free cash flow opportunity – obviously net drives free cash flow. There's a couple of things going on in free cash flow. One is, obviously when EPS comes down net comes down. But the corresponding opportunity around better inventory, better receivable management I think overshadows that. And so I think we still have an opportunity. And you see we did not come off our cash flow target for this year.
We're actually – again, one of the things we did to prepare for this is, okay, are we still on track with our free cash flow number? And again, we've instituted a cash flow forecasting process and we've got visibility – trying to get better visibility into it. And we did not come off it because we do believe we can still get to that approximately $120 million free cash flow number. So again, obviously when net comes down, cash flow comes down. But I do think we've got the opportunity to offset some of that.
The other thing – the other component of free cash flow is, in addition to operating cash flow, is obviously capital expenditures. CapEx is a little bit lower and we've got control over CapEx than we expected so far year-to-date. And we've got control over the – obviously what we spend in the fourth quarter. And so CapEx will be slightly favorable to our plans as well. And that'll help drive free cash flow. So those working capital and CapEx combined should offset the negative impact of the EPS takedown. And free cash flow feels like it's going to be where we thought it was going to be.
Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got you. Thanks, Jim.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah.

And our next question comes from Mark Massaro from Canaccord. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I apologize if I missed a good portion of this call. In the press release you talked about some of the tenders taking longer to ramp in Africa and Asia. How much of that do you expect will contribute to Q4 revenues? That's my first question.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So firstly, one of the tenders for Africa is of such size that it really was a major issue for us in our Q3 number in terms of what we'd expect it to begin to contribute. I think that one is pushed out probably into 2016 at this stage, it's a CD4 tender. So we've been anticipating that, and we've been actually bringing the customer on board. So it is a win, but it is going to be a longer to ramp up. So I think that's the most significant one. There have been other tenders, I think also just the buying patterns in Africa are such that people do sometimes hedge in mind of when they want certain of their deliveries (59:36), and so we see that volatility. So I think that there's a moderate impact in improving Q4. I think for CD4 it really is being pushed out into 2016 now.
Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. And you're not the first company to talk about some softness in Europe. Can you just maybe characterize what the month of October was like in Europe? And any signs of stabilizing? Or do you think it will remain an uncertain environment?
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
This is Jim. I don't think we want to be in a position where we're sort of commenting on intra-quarter results. We can talk a little bit about what happened in the third quarter, and that was overall softness, which you've heard, and in particular in some of our distributed products. And Namal can comment on that, but I don't think we should be commenting on anything intra quarter. Go ahead, Namal.
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

We did I think relatively well in Europe in the prior few quarters. And so again coming off that into this quarter, I would say that Europe goes on holiday in July and August, and in our case they didn't come back from holiday in September. So just – it has been worse than usual. I think hitting going forward, I don't think we're going to be bouncing back here in Europe to strong growth soon, and I think that's what we have to deal with as a business, is planning appropriately for a region which is probably going to take some further time. We do have some new assets, and there are some positive trends, particularly with products like Afinion and Epoc, but – and again, on an overall basis it's – we're just – I think we have to manage through a challenged region. I think most challenging of all has been the currency degradation on top of what has now turned into organic decline. So I don't see a flip back for Europe. I think we as a business are relying much more on the growth we expect in Asia and also we don't expect Africa to be anything but a short term issue.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. I just wanted to add to that which I just want to sort of put an emphasis on the point. We don't, one of the things that you asked about sort of inter quarter information, obviously, we're not going to give that. But when it comes to what are we planning for in Q4, we are not planning at all for any sort of significant snap back in Europe. It's one of the areas that we don't expect to snap back in the fourth quarter, so nothing heroic planned in Europe for us to hit our numbers.
Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay, thanks that's helpful. And can you maybe comment on whether or not you think it's possible to approach the organic growth rate you had in Q2? Obviously, you had a lot of things contribute in Q2. But just as we think about the fourth quarter, is it reasonable to expect a low single-digit organic growth rate?
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, the range we've provided is very low, and I think that we're conservative in our thinking around Q4 at this stage as we've articulated for revenue. I think that beyond Q4 and heading into 2016, certainly confidence is much greater that we're going to get to good growth. And I think the team really wants to perform. The team understands what it's going to take to perform. And so I think we just have to go and get it done. So Q4 does not plan for a big bounce in our organic growth, but heading into next year, I think there's a lot of things that are going well for us, and some of these headwinds do turn off basically because they're down to zero in some cases. So I think naturally we anticipate things like Epoc, Afinion, Triage, Alere i, those things starting to contribute positively and less headwinds offsetting them.
James F. Hinrichs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Afraid we're kind of past the hour here, so if that's okay, I think we're going to hand it back to Namal. He's going to make some final comments, and then we'll deal with any final other questions, on a one-on-one with people.
Go ahead, Namal?
Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, thanks, Jim.
So look, I think it's fair to say the revenue in the quarter was not what we were planning. But we did continue to progress as an organization. I think we are becoming a stronger organization every quarter. We had strong operating discipline which drove $0.54 of earnings which is again a strong improvement over prior year but also on the basis of the revenue delivered quite a good result.
I think most importantly, we do have a clear line of sight of restoring organic growth moderately in Q4 but accelerating in 2016. And with our revised guidance of $2.20 to $2.25 in earnings per share, that still represents roughly 20% earnings per share growth this year for full year which I think is again, one of our biggest areas of focus is delivering strong financials heading into 2016. So thank you very much for your interest and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Bye-bye.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Juliet Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.Juliet Cunningham - Vice President-Investor RelationsThank you.Good afternoon. Joining us for Alere's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call is Namal Nawana, our CEO and President; and Jim Hinrichs, our EVP and CFO. Both Namal and Jim have prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions.Our third quarter earnings release and the webcast presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. We'll also post our prepared remarks on our website shortly after the conclusion of this call. As a reminder, this conference call is being webcast live on Wednesday, November 4, 2015. The audio replay of this call will be available on our website through November 11, 2015. And our prepared remarks and earnings presentation will be posted and archived on our IR page.Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call, including, among others, statements with respect to anticipated future financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2015. Important additional information regarding these forward-looking statements is included in the first slide to the webcast presentation. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties described in our Form 10-K/A, Form 10-Qs and other SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements.In addition, during this call we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our third quarter earnings release, and is posted on our website.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Namal Nawana, CEO and President of Alere.Namal Nawana - President, Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you, Juliet. And thanks to all of you joining us.Jim will go through our financials in detail shortly. But I'm going to focus on three key topics this afternoon. First I'll discuss our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance, focusing mainly on revenue composition. Then I'll review our business unit results, including major product and market drivers. And finally I'll report our progress on key initiatives and plans that support Alere's success heading into 2016 and beyond. I'll be referencing some of the slides we've included in our earnings presentation, available on our website.Beginning with our third quarter performance. Revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share were below our expectations at $602 million and $0.54, respectively. As you can see in our earnings presentation on slide three, compared to the prior year period, revenue declined by $33 million in foreign currency exchange, $13 million in Pain Management and $8 million in INRatio, $9 million from BBI revenue and lower sales into our consumer joint venture, and $9 million in CD4 and Malaria products sold in Africa.Organic growth declined a negative 1.7% during the third quarter. Excluding Pain Management, organic growth was 0.3%. Despite these challenges, our core businesses had solid growth with increased sales in core platforms and services. From a global region perspective, Latin America grew organically by 19% year-over-year. Asia-Pacific grew 5%, Africa declined 12%, Europe declined 4%, and North America declined by 2%. Excluding Pain Management, North America grew by 1.2%. Jim will provide additional color of regional results later in the call.Now, I'd like to review the business performance in each of our three core business units. Unless otherwise noted, all growth figures are on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and dispositions.Beginning with our Cardiometabolic business, which grew organically by 4.3%, Q3 revenue was $208 million, and was driven by 15% growth in Asia and 2% growth in North America. From a product perspective, Afinion continues to perform well, with approximately 1425 placements during Q3 including large hospital placements in North America. Overall, Afinion A1C grew 26% globally in Q3.Epoc grew 23% as we fulfilled backorders and began adding new customers and expanding our presence further into the emergency department and other parts of the hospital. Patients on testing grew 12% and meter-based Triage grew in excess of 10%. This growth was offset by a lower INRatio in LDX cholesterol product sales.Our Infectious Disease business generated Q3 revenue of $164 million dollars, a 3.9% decline in organic growth. The decrease in organic growth compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by a 7% decline in Europe and a 13% decline in Africa. Africa declined due to lower CD4 and Malaria sales. In the case of CD4, the WHO recommended that doctors and clinicians prioritize viral load to monitor the success of antiretroviral therapy, but also acknowledged the need to include CD4 if viral load is not routinely available and also to help stratify risk. Given that point of care CD4 is lower cost, more accessible, and it provides connectivity through the cellular networks we continue to believe that our painless (6:17) CD4 remains a key tool to improve health outcomes. The change in guidelines has created some uncertainty in the CD4 market, but we expect CD4 sales to return to growth in 2016.Secondly, we've seen many opportunities to convert lab based CD4 testing to point of care in the HIV market. Malaria sales in Africa have also been impacted by the timing of tender shipments, which tend to fluctuate, and also continued pricing pressure. While we don't see pricing pressure abating in the near term we have new Malaria innovations in the pipeline that we believe will help mitigate the current pricing environment and deliver better economics in the future.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com
