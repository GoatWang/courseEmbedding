Timothy J. Gallagher
Favorite class in law school: Trial Advocacy taught by Judge Myron Bright of the 8th Circuit
Pet peeve about practicing law: Lawyers that think they have to fight everything
Favorite courthouse: St. Louis City Civil Courts Building
If I wasn’t practicing law, I would be: In the restaurant business.
Year started practicing law: 1988
Favorite Amendment to the US Constitution: For political correctness, as a Civil Trial Lawyer it should be the 7th Amendment which guarantees the right to a trial by jury in civil cases, but being a wine lover, I am glad that the 21st Amendment was passed in 1933, abolishing the 18th Amendment’s prohibition on the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors.
I felt like a real lawyer when: I walked out of the Missouri Supreme Court after my first Oral Argument in that Court in October, 1993.

Timothy J. Gallagher has 25+ years' experience as a Trial Lawyer. For the last 18+ years Tim has focused his practice on representing people who have sustained serious injuries from automobile accidents, medical malpractice and products liability.
Tim began practicing law in St. Louis in 1988, with Amelung, Wulff & Willenbrock an established Insurance Defense firm where he had the opportunity to learn from highly respected personal injury defense lawyers. Early in his career Tim gained valuable trial and appellate experience which included being on the losing side of the largest personal injury verdict in the history of St. Charles County and winning a case in the Missouri Supreme Court.
In 1996 Tim "switched sides" and began representing plaintiffs in personal injury cases.
Tim has tried jury cases in the United States District Court in St. Louis and in the Missouri State courts of St. Louis City, and the Counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson, Lincoln and Franklin. He has argued appeals before the Missouri Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court. He has won some cases and lost some cases. But most importantly, Tim has worked to help hundreds of people through difficult times in their lives.
Tim has earned a reputation as a dedicated, compassionate advocate and a creative thinker. Most clients are referred to Tim by other attorneys.  Tim believes that one of the highest compliments he can receive is when a lawyer that has been on the opposite side of a case with him refers an injured friend or family member to him.
Whether a client was referred by another lawyer, or finds Tim through the internet, Tim treats all of his clients with honesty and respect- even when that honesty is to tell somebody that there aren't enough facts to support a lawsuit or it doesn't make economic sense to pursue a case.  Tim has found over the years that when people have been injured or suffered a loss they often just want to talk to a lawyer to see if they "have a case."  Tim believes that it is his duty to provide an honest evaluation.  To Tim that is what it means to be a Counselor at Law.
For more than a decade Tim has maintained an AV Peer Review Rating from Martindale-Hubbell. Tim shared the top of the list for The Missouri Lawyers Weekly's "Top Plaintiff Lawyers 2008" for his role in winning the largest personal injury verdict in the State of Missouri that year. In January of this year Tim received the Missouri Lawyers Weekly Award for Most Plaintiff's Verdicts or Judgments which he shared with Matt Davis. He was named a Missouri- Kansas Super Lawyer in 2009,  2011 & 2014.
In addition to his practice of law, Tim served his community as an elected member of the City Council of Richmond Heights, Missouri from 2002 to 2010. He is an active member of Little Flower Parish in Richmond Heights where he served on the School Board from 1999 to 2002.  He was a volunteer CYC coach for his children's sports teams, when they were in grade school from 1996 to 2011.  Like Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa, (who is also a lawyer) Tim retired from his baseball managerial career on top after his son's 8th grade team won the CYC City / County Championship in 2011. From 2010 through 2014 Tim was a volunteer coach for Rosati- Kain in the BAMSL Sponsored High School Mock Trial competition.

Product Description▼▲
What does God want for our lives? How can we assess when feelings, even pleasant ones, are signs that God is calling us in a particular direction? In Spiritual Consolation, Fr. Timothy Gallagher introduces us to the teachings of Ignatius of Loyola on this crucial question. Through the use of real-life examples and the Ignatian principles from the Second Rule, Fr. Gallagher shows how all of us, especially those with busy religious lives, can learn to hear and follow God's leading.

For the last 18+ years Tim has focused his practice on representing people who have sustained serious injuries from automobile accidents, medical malpractice and products liability.Tim began practicing law in St. Louis in 1988, with Amelung, Wulff & Willenbrock an established Insurance Defense firm where he had the opportunity to learn from highly respected personal injury defense lawyers. Early in his career Tim gained valuable trial and appellate experience which included being on the losing side of the largest personal injury verdict in the history of St. Charles County and winning a case in the Missouri Supreme Court.In 1996 Tim "switched sides" and began representing plaintiffs in personal injury cases.Tim has tried jury cases in the United States District Court in St. Louis and in the Missouri State courts of St. Louis City, and the Counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson, Lincoln and Franklin. He has argued appeals before the Missouri Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court. He has won some cases and lost some cases. But most importantly, Tim has worked to help hundreds of people through difficult times in their lives.Tim has earned a reputation as a dedicated, compassionate advocate and a creative thinker. Most clients are referred to Tim by other attorneys. Tim believes that one of the highest compliments he can receive is when a lawyer that has been on the opposite side of a case with him refers an injured friend or family member to him.Whether a client was referred by another lawyer, or finds Tim through the internet, Tim treats all of his clients with honesty and respect- even when that honesty is to tell somebody that there aren't enough facts to support a lawsuit or it doesn't make economic sense to pursue a case. Tim has found over the years that when people have been injured or suffered a loss they often just want to talk to a lawyer to see if they "have a case." Tim believes that it is his duty to provide an honest evaluation. To Tim that is what it means to be a Counselor at Law.For more than a decade Tim has maintained an AV Peer Review Rating from Martindale-Hubbell. Tim shared the top of the list for The Missouri Lawyers Weekly's "Top Plaintiff Lawyers 2008" for his role in winning the largest personal injury verdict in the State of Missouri that year. In January of this year Tim received the Missouri Lawyers Weekly Award for Most Plaintiff's Verdicts or Judgments which he shared with Matt Davis. He was named a Missouri- Kansas Super Lawyer in 2009, 2011 & 2014.In addition to his practice of law, Tim served his community as an elected member of the City Council of Richmond Heights, Missouri from 2002 to 2010. He is an active member of Little Flower Parish in Richmond Heights where he served on the School Board from 1999 to 2002. He was a volunteer CYC coach for his children's sports teams, when they were in grade school from 1996 to 2011. Like Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa, (who is also a lawyer) Tim retired from his baseball managerial career on top after his son's 8th grade team won the CYC City / County Championship in 2011. From 2010 through 2014 Tim was a volunteer coach for Rosati- Kain in the BAMSL Sponsored High School Mock Trial competition.Read less

Verdicts & Settlements
Settlement reached in fireworks explosion case
On July 2, 2003, a trailer full of fireworks exploded in Bonita Springs, FL killing 5 people. The surviving children and the mother of two brothers who died were referred to Tim Gallagher by out of state lawyers. The case was filed in Missouri because the main defendants were a fireworks manufacturer and pyrotechnic show producer located in the St. Louis area. Tim Gallagher represented the family through 3 years of complex litigation that included dozens of depositions, a variety of expert witnesses and procedurals challenges that took the case all the way to the Missouri Supreme Court. The case settled a few weeks before trial in June, 2008.

What Our Clients Say
"Matt Davis went out of his way to make sure my needs were met. He drove 75 miles to meet me halfway between Sikeston and St. Louis, just so I wouldn’t have to drive the whole distance. I was very satisfied with how prompt Matt was about getting things done, and couldn’t have been more satisfied with the way things turned out. At the very beginning Matt told me it was going to be a hard case to win, and he asked me what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to carry on and he did. Matt did a very good job, and he did very good by me."
– Shannon
