Life[edit]
Childhood and education[edit]
Wright was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1947. His parents were missionaries in Brazil, though Chris as the youngest son was born after they came back at the end of the Second World War. He grew up in Belfast and was nurtured as an Irish Presbyterian. He studied classics at Cambridge in the 1960s, and then started his career as a high-school teacher in Grosvenor High School, Belfast. In the 1970s he studied for his PhD at Cambridge University in Cambridge, England, in the field of Theology, specialising in Old Testament economic ethics; his book from this work was published as God's People in God's Land (Eerdmans and Paternoster).
Early professional experience[edit]
Wright was ordained in the Anglican Church of England in 1977 and served as an assistant pastor in the Parish Church of St. Peter & St. Paul, Tonbridge, Kent, England.[3]
Foreign mission service[edit]
In 1983 Wright moved to India with his wife, Liz, and four children to teach at Union Biblical Seminary (UBS) in Pune for five years. At this time he and Liz were mission partners with Crosslinks, an evangelical Anglican mission agency. While at UBS he taught a variety of Old Testament courses at B.D. and M.Th. levels.[3]
All Nations Christian College[edit]
In 1988 Wright returned to the UK as academic dean at All Nations Christian College, an international training centre for crosscultural mission. He was appointed principal there in September 1993 and held that post for eight years.[3]
Current role[edit]
In September 2001 Wright was appointed to his present role as the International Ministries Director[1] of the Langham Partnership International (LPI).
Wright and his wife belong to All Souls Church, Langham Place,[2] where he enjoys preaching from time to time as a member of the ministry team. This is also the church, of course, where LPI's founder, John Stott, was rector emeritus.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Wright enjoys running, birding and watching rugby football. He has a passion to bring to life the relevance of the Old Testament to Christian mission and ethics. He has written several books mostly on that area. He loves preaching and teaching the Bible, which he does now mostly through the Langham Preaching seminars in different parts of the world. When not travelling around the world for this ministry, and giving international leadership to LPI, Chris gives about three months of each year to his continuing writing projects.
Wright and his wife Liz live in London and have four adult children and a growing number of grandchildren.

Christopher J.H. Wright


Revd Dr Christopher J. H. Wright (born 1947) is an Anglican clergyman and an Old Testament scholar. He is currently the International Ministries Director of Langham Partnership International[1]. He was the principal of All Nations Christian College. He is an honorary member of All Souls Church, Langham Place[2] in London, UK.

Life[edit]
Childhood and education[edit]
Wright was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1947. His parents were missionaries in Brazil, though Chris as the youngest son was born after they came back at the end of the Second World War. He grew up in Belfast and was nurtured as an Irish Presbyterian. He studied classics at Cambridge in the 1960s, and then started his career as a high-school teacher in Grosvenor High School, Belfast. In the 1970s he studied for his PhD at Cambridge University in Cambridge, England, in the field of Theology, specialising in Old Testament economic ethics; his book from this work was published as God's People in God's Land (Eerdmans and Paternoster).
Early professional experience[edit]
Wright was ordained in the Anglican Church of England in 1977 and served as an assistant pastor in the Parish Church of St. Peter & St. Paul, Tonbridge, Kent, England.[3]
Foreign mission service[edit]
In 1983 Wright moved to India with his wife, Liz, and four children to teach at Union Biblical Seminary (UBS) in Pune for five years. At this time he and Liz were mission partners with Crosslinks, an evangelical Anglican mission agency. While at UBS he taught a variety of Old Testament courses at B.D. and M.Th. levels.[3]
All Nations Christian College[edit]
In 1988 Wright returned to the UK as academic dean at All Nations Christian College, an international training centre for crosscultural mission. He was appointed principal there in September 1993 and held that post for eight years.[3]
Current role[edit]
In September 2001 Wright was appointed to his present role as the International Ministries Director[1] of the Langham Partnership International (LPI).
Wright and his wife belong to All Souls Church, Langham Place,[2] where he enjoys preaching from time to time as a member of the ministry team. This is also the church, of course, where LPI's founder, John Stott, was rector emeritus.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Wright enjoys running, birding and watching rugby football. He has a passion to bring to life the relevance of the Old Testament to Christian mission and ethics. He has written several books mostly on that area. He loves preaching and teaching the Bible, which he does now mostly through the Langham Preaching seminars in different parts of the world. When not travelling around the world for this ministry, and giving international leadership to LPI, Chris gives about three months of each year to his continuing writing projects.
Wright and his wife Liz live in London and have four adult children and a growing number of grandchildren.

Quotes by Christopher J.H. Wright



      “the whole Bible is itself a missional phenomenon. The writings that now comprise our Bible are themselves the product of and witness to the ultimate mission of God. The Bible renders to us the story of God's mission through God's people in their engagement with God's world for the sake of the whole of God's creation. The Bible is the drama of this God of purpose engaged in the mission of achieving that purpose universally, embracing past, present and future, Israel and the nations, "life, the universe and everything," and with its centre, focus, climax, and completion in Jesus Christ. Mission is not just one of a list of things that the Bible happens to talk about, only a bit more urgently than some. Mission is, in that much-abused phrase, "what it's all about.”

      “The reality is, of course, as soon as you think seriously about it, that the mission field is everywhere, including your own street – wherever there is ignorance or rejection of the gospel of Jesus Christ.”

Product Description
Additional Information
Reviews


Chris Wright’s pioneering 2006 book, The Mission of God, revealed that the typical Christian understanding of “missions” encompasses only a small part of God’s overarching mission for the world. God is relentlessly reclaiming the entire world for himself. In The Mission of God’s People, Wright shows how God’s big-picture plan directs the purpose of God’s people, the church. Wright emphasizes what the Old Testament teaches Christians about being the people of God. He addresses questions of both ecclesiology and missiology with topics like “called to care for creation,” “called to bless the nations,” “sending and being sent,” and “rejecting false gods.” As part of the Biblical Theology for Life Series, this book provides pastors, teachers, and lay learners with first-rate biblical study while at the same time addressing the practical concerns of contemporary ministry. The Mission of God’s People promises to enliven and refocus the study, teaching, and ministry of those truly committed to joining God’s work in the world.

Publisher's Description▼▲
It's almost second nature for Christians to call God Father. Jesus taught his followers as much, although for them it was apparently a surprising practice. The worshiping community of the Old Testament used fatherly images for understanding God's character and actions, but "Father" was not a common way for believers to address God. In Knowing God the Father Through the Old Testament, Christopher Wright explores in depth the images that pervade the biblical narratives, psalms and prophetic texts of the Old Testament. God is acknowledged as tender yet terrifying, challenging to the nations and yet intimately personal, offering loving care, provision, discipline and forgiveness. This is the God whom Jesus knew, and whom we can know, as Father. Such knowledge of God is far from merely devotional or doctrinal, but governs our worldview, personal and social ethics, and expectations of the future.


Author Bio▼▲
Christopher J. H. Wright (PhD, Cambridge) is international ministries director of the Langham Partnership, providing literature, scholarships, and preaching training for pastors in Majority World churches and seminaries. He has written many books including commentaries on Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and Ezekiel, , , , and    An ordained priest in the Church of England, Chris spent five years teaching the Old Testament at Union Biblical Seminary in India, and thirteen years as academic dean and then principal of All Nations Christian College, an international training center for cross-cultural mission in England. He was chair of the Lausanne Theology Working Group from 2005-2011 and the chief architect of The Cape Town Commitment from the Third Lausanne Congress, 2010.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"The reviewer commends it as a volume that will reward careful readers willing to reflect on its author's numerous perceptive insights."
"Wright capably demonstrates proper theological methodology while performing limied exegetical evaluation of the biblical text, demonstrating a biblical theological approach that can be grasped by the common reader."
"An experience of biblical theology from which any believer can benefit."
"Here is theology that feeds the soul in an immediate way, without getting sentimental. Pastors and church members will be rewarded in pocking up this work and meditating on the various topics that fill out a Christian understanding of who God is as our Father."
"I had originally expected an academic treatment of God the Father in the Old Testament (OT) with many references to Hebrew grammar but this is not what I got. What I did get was a very easy to read, somewhat devotional treatment of God as Father in the OT."
"A great starting point for sermons on the nature of God and His will."

Product Description▼▲
Old Testament ethics are often confusing to Christians. Some struggle to understand how it is that they must obey its moral laws but may disregard its ceremonial and civil laws. Others struggle with what they perceive to be contradictions. Others abandon its teaching altogether in favor of a strictly New Testament ethic. None of these, argues Chris Wright, gives the Old Testament its proper due.Old Testament Ethics for the people of God addresses these issues and in doing so provides an innovative but faithful approach to Old Testament ethics. First appearing in 1983, it has been fully revised fully revised and now includes material from Walking in the Ways of the Lord. Wright examines the theological, social, and economic framework for Old Testament ethics by exploring a variety of themes in relation to contemporary issues such as economics, the land, the poor, politics, law and justice, society and culture, and individual morality. This fresh, illuminating study provides a clear basis for a biblical ethic that is faithful to the God of both Testaments. A theological, social and economic framework for exploring Old Testament ethicsProvides the basis for an ethic faithful to both Old and New TestamentsThoroughly revisedExpanded with 100 more pages! Updated to include more consideration of contemporary issues: ecology, poverty, hermeneutics

Publisher's Description▼▲
Nothing confuses Christian ethics quite like the Old Testament. Some faithful readers struggle through its pages and conclude that they must obey its moral laws but may disregard its ceremonial and civil laws. Others abandon its teaching altogether in favor of a strictly New Testament ethic. Neither option, argues Chris Wright, gives the Old Testament its due.In this innovative approach to Old Testament ethics--fully revised, updated and expanded since its first appearance in 1983 as Living as the People of God ( An Eye for an Eye in North America) and including material from Walking in the Ways of the Lord--Wright examines a theological, social and economic framework for Old Testament ethics. Then he explores a variety of themes in relation to contemporary issues: economics, the land and the poor; politics and a world of nations; law and justice; society and culture; and the way of the individual.This fresh, illuminating study provides a clear basis for a biblical ethic that is faithful to the God of both Testaments.

Endorsements▼▲
Chris Wright has been one of the most significant writers on Old Testament ethics over recent decades. In a unique way he combines commitment to listening openly to the Old Testament as Scripture, reflectiveness over questions of method, and clarity as a writer. It is excellent that he has been able to stand back and rework so much of his important work into this definitive volume. 
-John Goldingay, 
Fuller Theological Seminary
After thirty years' research and writing on Old Testament ethics, Chris Wright has brought his conclusions together in this comprehensive and readable textbook. It is truly a magnum opus and should be at the top of the reading list for any student, teacher, minister or layperson interested in the relevance of the first part of the Bible to modern ethical issues. 
-David L. Baker,  Tyndale House, Cambridge

Remarkably balanced, sensitive, and thorough . . . A fine resource not only for the educator, but also for the pastor."
-Missiology, January 2006

Wright has fully revised and updated his two earlier books on Old Testament ethics, and has integrated them into one edition. The result is his fullest expression of the fruit of many years of reflection and study on the authority and relevance of Old Testament Scripture to Christian ethics. 
-Evangelical Review of Theology, 
July 2007

This is a wonderful book by an impressive scholar of the 1st Testament. In a culture that often cares little about social justice, the poor, and/or personal financial ethics, this book gives us a sobering look into the social requirements that God expected his people live by in the Old Testament. It is always a treat to find an author who has a great combination of scholarship and writing skill. I believe Christopher Wright is one such author, who has found a way to make his wonderful scholarship both informative and a joy to read. I would highly recommend this book.-On Thoughts From a Young, Slightly Cantankerous, Aspiring Theologian


Whether Wright's conclusions become the consensus opinion of the next generation obviously remains to be seen, but I can't imagine future discussion of the issue ignoring the well-thought out arguments laid out in this book. 
-Phil Sumpter, Chrisendom
