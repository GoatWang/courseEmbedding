XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language): is a computer language for the electronic transmission of business and financial data. Effective January 1, 2011, the SEC requires mutual funds to provide the risk/return summary section of their prospectuses to the SEC and on their websites in interactive data format using XBRL data tagging. The XBRL requirements are intended to provide investors and analysts a means to more effectively and efficiently analyze the information in the risk/return summary section of a Fund's prospectus. XBRL Documents are intended for use in applications that support that format.
