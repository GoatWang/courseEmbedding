Description
 Share113 Tweet Pin4 +1FlyPunch! DiveJars
Knock out fruit flies fast with Aunt Fannie’s FlyPunch!
• Fast. No other solution will eliminate your fruit fly problem as efficiently.
• Powerful. One DiveJar is most potent for 2 weeks. Lasts up to 30 days.
• Simple. No complicated instructions or setup.
• Clean. Made from natural concentrates with no poisonous ingredients.
PROTECT YOUR FAMILY & ELIMINATE FRUIT FLIES AT HOME
Aunt Fannie’s FlyPunch! is a powerful, non-toxic fruit fly formula that safely and effectively eliminates fruit flies. Safe around people and food, our revolutionary product is an ideal solution for protecting your family’s health. Fruit flies cause foods to spoil faster and can be an embarrassing issue in your home. Using FlyPunch! can reduce food spoilage and waste, and you can rest easy that your fruit fly problem will soon be a distant memory!
544% MORE EFFECTIVE
FlyPunch! is so effective, university research has found it kills up to 544% more fruit flies than comparable products.
NO MORE DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS
We get it. Fruit flies are disgusting and always seem to show up at the wrong time (as if there’s ever a good time). Trust us, it’s not your fault. Fruit flies hitchhike in on food or come in from outdoors, and no amount of cleaning will change that fact. Keep FlyPunch! in your kitchen and keep fruit flies away for good.
THE STRUGGLE IS REAL
While no one wants to see fruit flies in their home (or worse yet, have someone else see them), they typically find their way into the cleanest homes and kitchens as passengers on fruits and vegetables. They are just food’s little gift to all of us.
Unfortunately, they are more than just a nuisance. University studies have proven fruit flies can carry dirt and diseases. Since one female can lay up to 500 eggs at one time, fruit flies are not something to take lightly. They’re annoying, dirty, and often ruin perfectly good food. Aunt Fannie’s FlyPunch! can help you eat clean, truly.
DIRECTIONS
1. BUY FLYPUNCH!
One DiveJar is most potent for 2 weeks and covers an area of about 500 cubic feet.
2. OPEN THE DIVEJAR FLIP TOP & REMOVE THE SEAL.
Aunt Fannie and the fruit flies will take care of the rest.
3. SET OUT YOUR FLYPUNCH! DIVEJARS
Place your jars near common fruit flies areas.
4. COUNT THE BODIES
If you like that sort of thing.

 Share113 Tweet Pin4 +1FlyPunch! For Your Business
In the food and drink industry, food safety is paramount and it’s critical to keep fruit flies at bay. Our commercial grade, powerful, non-toxic formula will attract and eliminate fruit flies in your commercial establishment. What’s best is FlyPunch! is safe to use in restaurants, bars, wineries, breweries, bakeries, cafeterias, food/beverage facilities… it’s safe to use near people and all food! Just use FlyPunch! to kill your fruit flies. You’ll be happy you did.
Shop Commercial
Fruit flies are serious contaminators of food, appear from nowhere, and then multiply at incredible rates. Fruit flies are considered the greatest menace to many sectors of the food and drink industry, and are frequently cited as the contaminating agent in reports of food seizures by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The worst part is, they typically enter an establishment on or in the food and drink products purchased from others. So no matter how clean you keep your business, fruit flies are a daily threat to the cleanliness of your establishment, reputation with customers, and spoilage rates of your food and drink products.
FLYPUNCH IS 544% MORE EFFECTIVE
University research found FlyPunch! 544% more effective than comparable products. What’s more, unlike other commercial competitors, we don’t use poisons derived from World War 2 nerve agents (true story).
BUILT FOR DISTRIBUTION
We love it when others help us with our mission of killing fruit flies around the world. In fact, we love it so much that we’ve built an entire store just for you. Granted, you have to send us some information first, but once you get past our fruit fly ninja security team, you’ll be well on your way to certified death dealer status…of fruit flies. Who knows? We might even send you an official death dealer certificate for being that awesome.

 Share11 Tweet Pin1 +1All Purpose Pest Remedy
Aunt Fannie’s believes in the pure power of food-based ingredients, so we’ve created solutions using the natural elements of food. Because we regularly mist, mop and wipe our most sacred places (our homes!) with products that can get on our skin, breathed into our lungs, and even sprayed onto our food, it’s finally time to embark on the next evolution in cleaning and pest! Please join us in our movement toward Healthier Housekeeping!
Years ago, pest remedies were homegrown and an active part of everyday housekeeping. Aunt Fannie’s All-Purpose Pest Remedy is a natural alternative to pesticides and an easy way to keep your home fresh, clean, and free from unwelcome guests. We make our products with the ingredients nature gave us, not for looks, so haziness or cloudiness with our formulations will often occur naturally. Enjoy!
Directions
Shake well. Use Aunt Fannie’s Pest Remedy as part of your normal cleaning routine. To establish a protective barrier, spray around windows, doors and baseboards. Spray on surfaces under sinks, in cabinet corners and behind appliances. Spray directly on pests as necessary. 
Storage & Disposal
Store in a cool, dry place. Do not reuse or refill this container. Recycle if available.
Ingredients

Aunt Fannie's Continues to Expand with Adam Wilczewski Named Executive Vice President

		  High-growth Greenville-based company provides innovative, natural solution to a global food supply and safety problem
		

Jan 13, 2015, 09:52 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Aunt Fannie’s, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


GREENVILLE, S.C., Jan. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Aunt Fannie's, Inc. (www.auntfannie.com), creator of an all-natural, non-toxic, powerful, fast-acting fruit fly solution called FlyPunch!™, continues its rapid expansion with the appointment of Adam Wilczeweski, formerly Chief of Staff at the U.S. International Trade Administration (ITA), as Executive Vice President. Aunt Fannie's burgeoning growth is reflective of the convergence of the soaring need for a solution to the global issue of fruit flies in food manufacturers, restaurants, wineries, homes and beyond, and the demand for safer, natural, non-toxic products. In fact, Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services emphasizes that "Fruit flies are one of the most potentially destructive pests in the world." Aunt Fannie's meets this critical need with a safe, non-toxic, easy-to-use, university-researched solution that is being adopted by businesses, food establishments, and homes nationwide.
To meet this global need with Aunt Fannie's lab-tested natural, non-toxic products, Mr. Wilczewski initially joined the company as an enthusiastic backer through his own venture firm Busch Global Ventures (BGV), having graduated alongside the company's founder Mat Franken from the University of Florida and both having held leadership positions in Phi Delta Theta. With the company's continued success, Wilczewski is thrilled to be joining the team full-time to leverage his expertise and international experience to help further build upon this growth domestically and globally. 
"Adam comes to us with years of global leadership experience spanning prestigious roles in government, corporate, entreprenueral, international, legal and fundraising sectors," says Mat Franken, Founder & CEO. "It is truly an honor to have Adam as such an important part of these next phases of our growth. The demand for our products has been phenomenal across multiple industries ranging from breweries and wineries to restaurants, homes, commercial and agricultural applications. Adam's deep experience across multiple sectors will enable us to capitalize on these global demands for our offerings and enable us to continue to scale, empowering individuals and corporations to handle fruit flies safely, effectively and naturally."
Prior to founding Busch Global Ventures, Mr. Wilczewski led the efforts at the International Trade Administration under the U.S. Department of Commerce to strengthen the domestic and international competitiveness of U.S. industry through multi-lateral trade and investment activities. In addition to business affairs, Mr. Wilczewski has served in leadership roles in four presidential campaigns.
"When I found out Mat had started his own company that provides an extremely effective, natural solution to such a glaring global problem, I had to get involved," explains Adam Wilczewski. "Flypunch! is potently effective and the only singularly safe product amongst its peers, fitting the growing consumer and industrial demand for non-toxic, all-natural solutions. Furthermore, working with an old friend makes building a high-growth business also a lot of fun."
Aunt Fannie'sAunt Fannie's, Inc., founded by Mat Franken in 2012, is the maker of FlyPunch!, a powerful, non-toxic, all-natural fruit fly pesticide that is fast, simple, honest and safe for use around food. Aunt Fannie's FlyPunch! is designed for household kitchens, food service and food distribution centers, restaurants, bars, hotels, cafeterias, breweries, wineries and anywhere fresh food or produce is handled, grown or prepared.  Aunt Fannie's FlyPunch! is available at most health food retailers such as Whole Foods, Sprouts and Bristol Farms or can be ordered directly online through Amazon.com or the company's website, www.auntfannie.com.  
For further information or to arrange an interview with CEO, Mat Franken, please contact Kevin Oaks at koaks@christiecomm.com or (805) 969-3744.
