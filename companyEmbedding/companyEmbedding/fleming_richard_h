Richard H. Fleming, in full Richard Howell Fleming  (born September 21, 1909, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada—died October 25, 1989, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), Canadian-born American oceanographer who conducted wide-ranging studies in the areas of chemical and biochemical oceanography, ocean currents (particularly those off the Pacific coast of Central America), and naval uses of oceanography.Fleming joined the Scripps Institution in La Jolla, California, in 1931 and served as assistant director from 1946 to 1950, when he left to become professor of oceanography at the University of Washington.Fleming measured the amounts of chemical elements in sea water and in marine life. His work on ocean currents included measurement of tidal-current velocities, description of upwelling of seawater, and observations of seasonal variations in currents. He also explored sedimentation in moving and stagnant bodies of water. With H.U. Sverdrup and Martin W. Johnson, Fleming wrote The Oceans (1942).

Air Products Losing A V.p. To Competitor - tribunedigital-mcall






 


 Home→Collections→Air ProductsAir Products Losing A V.p. To CompetitorJune 02, 1989|by TOM MOYLAN, The Morning CallIn what one stock analyst described as potentially "bad news" for the company, the top executive for industrial gases at Air Products and Chemicals Inc. has announced he is taking a job with one of its main international competitors.Alexander P. "Pat" Dyer, 56, of Bethlehem, executive vice president- gases and equipment, will leave the Trexlertown-based company after more than 25 years to become managing director-gases for The BOC Group in England.The fourth-highest-paid executive at Air Products in the last fiscal year, Dyer was considered by industry analysts to be one of the top candidates - if not the top - for the company presidency after Dexter F. Baker succeeded Edward Donley as chairman and chief executive officer in late 1986. The job went instead to Frank J. Ryan, then vice president of the company's chemicals group."I'm sure that was the immediate cause" of Dyer's departure, said Robert Hardiman, a securities analyst with Merrill Lynch Research.Leslie C. Ravitz, an analyst with Salomon Bros., said he thought Dyer would not have left if he had been named president.Dyer could not be reached for comment yesterday.Dyer "has made a valuable contribution to the company, most particularly to the success of our industrial gas operations," said Ryan in an company memo. "Pat is highly regarded and respected by his colleagues and he will be missed."In an internal memo dated Wednesday, Ryan told Air Products officials that Dyer was taking early retirement.William J. Kendrick, Air Products vice president of public affairs, said he did not know when Dyer's retirement would become effective. BOC, in an announcement released yesterday, said Dyer will assume his duties in July.Dyer will be responsible for BOC's worldwide gas business, BOC said, and will sit on the board of directors.He will be based at the group's headquarters in Windlesham, England.Dyer will oversee a worldwide industrial gas business that posted $2.5 billion in revenues and $376 million in operating profits during BOC's 1988 fiscal year, according to spokeswoman Patricia A. Secrist. By comparison, Air Products' gas business had revenues of $1.4 billion and operating income of $306 million last year.Air Products' total revenue for the 1988 fiscal year was $2.4 billion. BOC had revenues of $4.3 billion for fiscal 1988, Secrist said.Dyer's appointment comes as BOC has been trying aggressively to gain market share in the U.S. by cutting prices or avoiding price increases, Hardiman said. The British company also has been buying out the few remaining independent regional industrial gas producers.BOC's Airco Gases Division recently agreed to buy the industrial gases and carbon dioxide divisions of the AmeriGas subsidiary of UGI Corp."BOC got a good person," Ravitz said. "They need management help. It's a plus for BOC."Dyer fills a position which Secrist said was vacant for several years after the previous managing director left for health reasons."I would think that this is bad news for Air Products that someone high up in the company organization who knows all of their trade secrets would be going to a major competitor," Hardiman said. "I'm surprised that they might not have had some sort of non-competitive agreement" with Dyer, he said.Ravitz was less dire in his evaluation: "It's more of a positive for BOC than a huge negative for Air Products."Dyer's departure from the top management team is rare for Air Products, a company known for having long-term employees and orderly succession. Hardiman and Ravitz each said they knew of only one instance of a top Air Products executive leaving to take another job.Hardiman said Richard Fleming, one of Air Products' chemicals executives, left the company for GAF Corp. "This (Dyer's departure) is even more monumental because the industrial-gas division is by far the dominant business.""It's also more monumental in the sense that he's going to a direct competitor," Hardiman said.Hardiman and Ravitz said that Air Products' strength of recruiting talented people will provide it a good pool of candidates for the void left by Dyer.Dyer began his career in marketing with Exxon Corp. and joined Air Products in 1963. He was named vice president of industrial gases in 1969, gas group vice president in 1978 and executive vice president-gases and equipment in 1987.He was elected to the Air Products board of directors in 1988.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
