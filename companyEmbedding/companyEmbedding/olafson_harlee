There's a popular story that Mankato was really supposed to be Mahkato after the Dakota Indians' name for the Blue Earth River.
While that may or may not be true, no one these days would mistake Mankato -- or its sister city North Mankato -- for the sleepy agricultural town it once was.




 


Today, the community's economy is driven by a number of factors: manufacturing, health care, education and agriculture.
"We have a very well-balanced and diverse economy," said Jonathan Zierdt, president and CEO of Greater Mankato Growth Inc. "There is no one horse that drives this community."
With that diversity comes a number of players who have helped shape Mankato's present and are helping to formulate its future. These 10 "movers and shakers" are:
Jonathan Zierdt considers himself an orchestra conductor.
He doesn't play the instruments. He doesn't compose. But if he does his job right as president and CEO of Greater Mankato Growth Inc. (a recent business merger of the Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Corp.), he can make beautiful music.
"Our job is to connect the right players at the right time," said the 41-year-old southern Minnesota native. "If we do it right, the community remains vibrant and well-balanced."
So far, Zierdt, who took over his current position in 2004, sees a community that is hitting on all cylinders.
Mankato/North Mankato last year was identified as No. 10 in the nation in the Top Micropolitans category for new and expanded corporate facilities by Site Selection magazine. The community also has been named two years in a row as one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People by America's Promise Alliance and has been singled out by the American Association of Retired Persons as one of four communities to watch.
And by 2011, Mankato/North Mankato expects to be recognized as Minnesota's next metropolitan statistical area by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget -- a designation that Zierdt believes will help attract talent.

"It is kind of like having a tiger by the tail," he said. "The future of this community is immense."
JEROME CREST admits that he's, well, experienced when it comes to getting things done in Mankato.
Crest, a native of Minnesota, is chief administrative officer for Immanuel St. Joseph's - Mayo Health System in Mankato. And he has been since 1984.
"I admit it, I'm the old man," the 66-year-old said, laughing.
Under his tenure, the health care system has grown, evolving from a $50 million-a-year business in the 1990s to $250 million today. It is Mankato's second-largest employer.
But Crest's community involvement doesn't stop at his doorstep. He is chair of the Mankato Chamber of Commerce and formerly led Valley Industrial Development Corp.
His involvement, he said, is part of his own beliefs and his organization's self-interest. "As an organization, we benefit if the community is prosperous. We need to have a great community to attract people," he said.
Mankato, Crest said, is blessed with many assets, such as good schools, available land and higher-education facilities.
"We are all very bullish on what is happening in Mankato and what can happen as we go forward," he said.
Mankato-born and -bred, TIM LIDSTROM grew up watching the earth-movers building Highway 169 near his home along the river. At 14, he filled sandbags during the 1965 floods.
"I've seen the growth of this community, and it has changed considerably," said Lidstrom, 56, owner of Lidstrom Commercial Realtors.





Of late, much of that change has involved Lidstrom. He has helped to find homes for Menards, Home Depot and Lowe's and assisted in putting together the land parcel that got Mankato the Wal-Mart distribution center scheduled for construction next year.
"I'm really more of a facilitator than a mover and shaker," he said, but he is proud of his role in attracting the big-box stores, which are helping to make Mankato a regional center. Lidstrom has been in real estate in the area since 1979 and has owned Lidstrom Commercial Realtors for eight years.
He also has great optimism about the future, especially if area officials are able to persuade the Legislature to back establishing a link between Mankato and Interstate 35W -- a move he thinks will shape the future of Mankato.
For Jean Taylor, Mankato is where she grew up.
"Mankato is a place that really moves itself forward but isn't out there trying the most radical thing," said the 44-year-old president and CEO of Mankato's largest employer, Taylor Corp. Cos., which specializes in personalized communication products and services. "It is small enough for people to be connected but big enough to provide opportunities."
In fact, opportunity is just what Mankato offered her dad. As a college student, Glen Taylor started with Carlson Wedding Services as a part-time employee. By 1975, he purchased the company and, true to his entrepreneurial spirit, began looking for ways to expand beyond its wedding focus.
Today, Taylor Corp. includes 100-plus subsidiaries in 22 states and eight countries, employing more than 14,000 people. But its base is still in Mankato.
And employees for the firm serve on a variety of local boards, the United Way and the local colleges.
"We take our position in Mankato very, very seriously," Jean Taylor said.
For her part, Taylor serves as vice chair of the Minnesota Early Learning Foundation and is working on issues of early-childhood development initiatives.
The result: "Mankato is a place where people want to be," Taylor said.
Mankato can be thankful that Dennis Miller didn't want to leave his Minnesota roots.
Miller, 48, was on his way to becoming a bigwig with a Chicago-based communications firm when he decided to stay near home. So he took a job with a Wisconsin telecommunications firm, which eventually asked him to head an effort to help a group of independent telephone companies build a wireless network based in Mankato.
He and his wife Jackie moved to Mankato in 1990 and have never left, raising their two children there.
And even though Midwest Wireless was sold to Arkansas-based Alltel in 2005 and Miller has retired, Miller said he has no intention of scaling back his commitment to Mankato and the area.
The 1982 Mankato State University graduate serves on the Southern Minnesota Leadership Circle and the boards of Immanuel St. Joseph's and the Minnesota State University-Mankato Foundation.
"I see my role as a facilitator," Miller said. "We have all the elements we need to continue to grow. We are a rural area that is acting as a regional center. We have rush minute; not rush hour. And we have leadership."
Denny Dotson is president of Dotson Co. Inc., Mankato's oldest manufacturing firm, a foundry in business since 1876.
After growing up in Mankato and leaving to make it on his own, Dotson returned to the company and town in 1972. After the death of his father in 1978, he took over as president.
"Back then we had to make excuses for Mankato. You know, 'We're only so long from the Twin Cities or so many miles from Southdale,' " said the 62-year-old father of four and grandfather of five. "I don't think there is a reason for us to make excuses anymore."
Dotson's hand in that change can be felt by his presence on many boards and commissions over the years, from helping to establish Valley Industrial Development Corp. to aiding in the creation of the city's Civic Center.
But his most recent role has been as one of the members of the InterCity Leadership Group, which he credits with helping to spur the development of the Twin Valley Arts Council and other progress in the city.
"We have all the good things the big cities have and don't have a lot of the things they have that they don't want," he said.
Curt Fisher came to Mankato in 1966 to attend college, met his wife Debbie, and never left.
Today, the 58-year-old father of three heads the Coldwell Banker Commercial Fisher Group in Mankato and has had his fingers in a number of developments that have helped change the shape of the city.




 


Fisher, a native of Robbinsdale, said that when he started in real estate in 1972, times were quite different -- the focus was solely on residential real estate deals. But he quickly decided he wanted to focus on commercial, launching his own firm and commercial property management company in 1976.
"When I started, there was just one regional mall, and there weren't many players or risk-takers," Fisher said. "It was just local people and companies making investments within our own market."
Today, Fisher's Coldwell Banker firm is one of three commercial firms in the area, two of which just recently started. And the demand for good investment opportunities has grown substantially.
"I don't think Mankato was on the radar screen the way it is today," he said. "In 1972, we were an agricultural community with some retail. Today, we are much more diverse."
JOE L. WILLAERT grew up in Mankato, graduated from St. John's University and went to work for an outstate Big 8 accounting firm.
But when an opportunity to return to the Mankato area emerged in 1977, he and his wife Pam came home.
Today, the partner for Eide Bailly in Mankato says his community work with the Greater Mankato InterCity Leadership Group and the Greater Mankato Business Accelerator Council is all about helping to make the community an even better place to live for the next generation.
"I think most people feel like they want to help shape the future in whatever little way they can," said the 57-year-old, who has two adult children living in the area. "It is about what we are going to pass on to the next generation."
And he admits that Mankato today is much different from the Mankato he grew up in. "It has changed dramatically," he said. "We have mushroomed into a south-central Minnesota retail area, and the growth of the health care area has been most obvious."
RICHARD DAVENPORT is changing how Minnesota State University-Mankato works.
And the 61-year-old is determined to see that continue.
Since his appointment as the university's 12th president in 2002, Davenport has:
    Created a new position -- vice president for strategic business, education and regional partnerships in economic development -- that is directly responsible for helping the university find ways to help the region grow, a program thought to be the first of its kind in the state.       Launched a program to build on the campus master plan, including capital projects -- like the addition to the science and engineering building and the new residence hall under construction -- to help spur the growth of the university. His goal is to increase enrollment to 20,000 (currently there are 14,500 students).       Overseen the university's launch of its first doctoral programs -- in nursing and counselor education. There will be more to follow, he said.       Spearheaded a major capital campaign, receiving $21 million this year alone.  
He also is launching an effort to attract more transfer students, starting with a statewide tour of the state's 25 community and technical colleges to encourage those students to think about continuing their education.
"We are working hard on branding our university," he said. "We really believe that a public partnership like ours needs to serve the whole region."
As a banker, HARLEE OLAFSON knows it takes investments to make businesses grow.
The 49-year-old community banking president for Wells Fargo in Mankato extends that same philosophy to his community.
Since moving to Mankato in 1989 with his wife Denita and three sons, Olafson, who was recently named business-banking area manager, has served on a variety of boards, including the Chamber of Commerce, South Central College and the Minnesota State University-Mankato Foundation.
"Part of our role is to make Mankato a better place to live, and to do that you have to be involved in the community," said the North Dakota native, who began his banking career in Valley City, N.D.
Olafson said he believes Mankato is uniquely situated to succeed in the future because of the broad spectrum of economic opportunities offered by its colleges, medical community and agricultural and retail base.
"The community has a very bright future because it isn't tied to any one thing to make it strong," he said.
