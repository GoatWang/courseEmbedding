History[edit]
Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 by Dr. Felix Zandman. The Company was named after Dr. Zandman’s ancestral village in Lithuania, Veisiejai. It began operations with a patented technology that had two product lines: foil resistors and foil resistance strain gauges. In 1985, having grown from a start-up into the world's leading manufacturer of these original products, the company began an ongoing series of acquisitions to become a broadline manufacturer of electronics components.[2]
Having expanded into so many product lines, Vishay announced in October 2009 that it would be creating a spin-off company which focuses on their high precision technologies in Foil Technology. Vishay Precision Group represents approximately 9% of Vishay annual revenue, and included their product lines in Bulk Metal Foil Resistors, micro-measurements, load cells, process weighing, and on-board weighing.[3][4] In July 2010, Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group (VPG).
Since 1985, Vishay has pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements: expanding within the electronic components industry, primarily through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components; reducing expenses; transferring manufacturing operations to countries with lower labor costs and government-sponsored incentives; maintaining significant production facilities in regions where Vishay markets the bulk of its products; continually rolling out new products; and strengthening relationships with customers and strategic partners. As a result of this strategy, Vishay has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world’s largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.[5]
Some of the manufacturers that Vishay has acquired include HiRel Systems (2012), the resistor business of Huntington Electric (2011), the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET (2008), the PCS business of International Rectifier (2007), BCcomponents and Beyschlag (2002), General Semiconductor, the infrared components business of Infineon, Mallory (NACC), and Tansitor (2001), Cera-Mite, Electro-Films, and Spectrol (2000), Siliconix and Telefunken (1998), Vitramon (1994), Roederstein (1993), Sprague (1992), Sfernice (1988), Draloric (1987), and Dale (1985).[6]
The former Spectrol Reliance factory in Swindon, England, (UK arm of Spectrol Electronics that was acquired by Vishay in 2000, originally known as Reliance Controls) was the last design by Team 4 (Richard Rogers, Norman Foster and their respective wives), and is considered the first example of High-tech architecture in the United Kingdom. It opened in 1967 and was demolished in 1991, Spectrol Reliance moving to a different part of Swindon.[7]

Vishay Precision Group Mourns the Loss of Dr. Felix Zandman








Company Release - 06/06/2011 09:26







MALVERN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--       Vishay Precision Group, Inc. (“VPG”) (NYSE: VPG) announced today, with       great sadness, the passing of Dr. Felix Zandman, the inventor and       founder of the foil technology upon which the VPG business is based. Dr.       Zandman, who was 83 years old, was also the founder and Executive       Chairman of the Board of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (“Vishay”)       (NYSE:VSH). VPG was successfully spun of from Vishay in 2010 and Dr.       Zandman served as an R&D consultant to VPG after the spinoff.
Mr. Marc Zandman, the son of Dr. Zandman, is the non-executive Chairman       of the Board of VPG. Vishay announced today that its Board has elected       Marc Zandman as its Executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Ziv Shoshani,       VPG’s President and Chief Executive Officer, is the nephew of Dr.       Zandman and also serves on the Board of Vishay. Mr. Steven Klausner, VPG       Vice President and Treasurer, is Dr. Zandman’s son-in law.
Marc Zandman said, “On behalf of VPG and the entire Zandman and Shoshani       families, I am deeply proud of the many contributions my father made to       Vishay, VPG, our industry and Israel, as well as the legacy he leaves       behind. My father’s high standards and values are embedded in VPG’s       culture and impact all that we do at VPG, across the globe, every day.       We fully intend to continue his ideals in both business and personal       matters.”
Ziv Shoshani said, “Dr. Zandman will never be forgotten as his legacy       will live on, around the world through the many people he touched,       including all VPG’s employees. VPG will continue to implement the       vision, strategy and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman.”
Dr. Zandman was born in 1928 in the Polish city of Grodno. In October       1941, he and his family were arrested by the Nazis and sent to the       Grodno ghetto. In 1943, Dr. Zandman survived the Holocaust by hiding       with his uncle and other people under the floor boards in the house of a       Polish family for 17 months. While hiding, Dr. Zandman’s uncle taught       him trigonometry and higher mathematics. Following the war, in 1946, Dr.       Zandman emigrated to France, where he earned a mechanical engineering       degree, an MS in physics from the University of Nancy (France), and a       PhD in physics from the University of Paris, Sorbonne.
In 1956, Dr. Zandman moved to the United States and began working for       Tatnall Measuring Systems, a division of the Budd Company of       Philadelphia, as director of basic research. During this time he       developed PhotoStress® measurement instruments and revolutionary,       temperature-resistant foil resistors, which enable manufacturers of a       wide assortment of precision electronics products to enhance their       performance. When Tatnall declined to market his high-end resistors, Dr.       Zandman, with financial support from his uncle Alfred P. Slaner, founded       Vishay. The Vishay name, after which Vishay Intertechnology and Vishay       Precision Group were named, is the name of the village in Lithuania       where relatives of Dr. Zandman perished during the Holocaust.
Dr. Zandman published numerous scientific papers, three textbooks, and       an autobiography (“Never the Last Journey”) and held over 70 patents. He       won numerous awards including the Best Strategic Investor Award from the       Israel Manufacturers Association (awarded by the President of Israel);       the Legion of Honor, France (awarded by the President of the Republic of       France); the Order of Merit for Research and Invention (France); the       Franklin Institute Medal for Science (USA); the Electronic Industries       Alliance Medal of Honor (presented at a ceremony attended by the       President of the United States); and the Lifetime Achievement Award from       the National Electronic Distributors Association. He was awarded the       title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Beer Sheva (Israel)       and from the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion). In 1994, Dr.       Zandman also became a citizen of the State of Israel.
Dr. Zandman is survived by his wife Mrs. Ruta Zandman; his children, Dr.       Gisele Zandman Goddard and her husband Eli, Mrs. Ariele Zandman Klausner       and her husband Steven, and Mr. Marc Zandman and his wife Orit; and nine       grandchildren.

His courage, perseverance and dedication are an inspiration to us all. We will honor his legacy of unwavering commitment, passion and energy by moving Vishay forward under the strong leadership of Marc Zandman and Dr. Gerald Paul and our outstanding global management team," said Eliyahu Hurvitz on behalf of the board of directors of Vishay in a statement. "We extend our deepest sympathies to his family members. Dr. Zandman will be greatly missed." 

Vishay has provided the following account of Zandman's life:

Zandman was born in 1928 in the Polish city of Grodno and in October 1941, he and his family were arrested by the Nazis and sent to the Grodno ghetto. Dr. Zandman survived the Holocaust by hiding with his uncle Sender and other people under the floor boards in the house of a Polish family for 17 months. While in hiding, Dr. Zandman’s uncle taught him trigonometry and higher mathematics. Following the war, in 1946, Dr. Zandman emigrated to France, where he earned a mechanical engineering degree and MS in physics from the University of Nancy (France) and a PhD in physics from the University of Paris, Sorbonne. 

In 1956, Dr. Zandman moved to the United States and began working for Tatnall Measuring Systems in Philadelphia as director of basic research. During this time he developed PhotoStress measurement instruments and revolutionary temperature-resistant resistors, which enable manufacturers of a wide assortment of precision products to upgrade their performance. When Tatnall declined to market his temperature-resistant resistors, Dr. Zandman, with financial support from his uncle Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay. The Company was named after the village in Lithuania where relatives of Dr. Zandman had perished during the Holocaust. 

Dr. Zandman published numerous scientific papers, three textbooks, and an autobiography (“Never the Last Journey”) and held over 70 patents. He won numerous awards including the Best Strategic Investor Award from the Israel Manufacturers Association (awarded by the President of Israel); the Legion of Honor, France (awarded by the President of the Republic of France); the Order of Merit for Research and Invention (France); the Franklin Institute Medal for Science (USA); the Electronic Industries Alliance Medal of Honor (presented at a ceremony attended by the President of the United States); and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Electronic Distributors Association. He was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Beer Sheva (Israel) and from the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion). In 1994, Dr. Zandman also became a citizen of the State of Israel. 

Dr. Zandman is survived by his wife Mrs. Ruta Zandman; his children, Dr. Gisele Zandman Goddard and her husband Eli, Mrs. Ariele Zandman Klausner and her husband Steven, and Mr. Marc Zandman and his wife Orit; and nine grandchildren.

Eric,

Thanks for your comments.

You will do well in this world, because you are "information adverse".

... and in this world, too much information is 
"anti-semitic".

Shalom,
Marty Cohen

I thought engineers were too smart for being anti-Semites.  Unfortunately, it seems that I was wrong.  There are a-holes even among engineers.
On the other hand, you say you need somebody's help.  Perhaps a psychiatrist might help you.
Eric.

The man's life story is inspiring and admirable. I was moved to order his autobiography when I started to read about his life. I never had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Zandman, but it is clear to me that he led an extraordinary life.

It goes to show we should respect all human lives. Stories like this tells us how many Jewish people contributed to the scientific discoveries. Politics and racism don't mix.
