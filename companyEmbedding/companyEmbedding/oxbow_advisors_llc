The Tortoise and the Hare
By admin, Posted on Jul. 17, 2017Jul. 17, 2017Categories Uncategorized

The first six-month price movement of the stock market in 2017 reminds us of the legendary “Aesop’s Fables” race between The Tortoise and the Hare. The market has alternated so far this year between two extremes … (1) slow, sluggish movements with the tortoise (turtle) dominating and (2) where the hare (rabbit) took the market on a wild ride to all-time highs in early June. It has been a challenging time to be an investor, with many conflicting economic and political events, both domestic and international. This has led to much ongoing confusion. Returns of various major market measurements for the first half of 2017 ending June 30 are shown in Exhibit 1.
Every equity-oriented strategy we manage at Oxbow had positive results for the first half of 2017, including our fixed-income investments. Our Long-Term Growth equity strategy led the various disciplines, while the income strategy held up even in the face of Wall Street’s continued call for higher interest rates.

Crazy Eddie – Wall Street Duped Again
This month makes 30 years ago when Federal Investigators started looking at the Crazy Eddie company. Ultimately it was an involved story of wives, fathers and other relatives. It turned out to be one of the longest (18 years) frauds. Eddie Antar sold almost all his stock after an $8 to $90 run up in price and fled to Israel. In 1993 he was convicted of $80 million stock fraud. He died this past September according to Wikipedia. This is one of those stories worth getting on the internet as it is a tale of tales…Many moving parts but worth the read.

We’re Not Wall Street.
Every single investment group that calls on you will have the same booklet, with the same people, the same pictures, and the same graphs. 
All of them will sell you the latest and greatest investment product that will give you “the best” return. What they don’t tell you is they limit their offerings to what is best for their firm and themselves. Many of the incentives for Wall Street are based on volume and quantity instead of quality. How many times do you hear about a really conservative investment for a really low cost? They will have little or no patience for you needing some really, really safe and secure money. They don’t make any money from it, so they will never suggest it.
At Oxbow, we are not paid to sell you anything. As independent advisors, we have the ability to span the landscape of the best quality investments to fit your unique needs. We do not get caught up in the glitz and glam of the latest investment offerings. Better yet, we know how to hold onto money in good times and bad.

Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!
