Beautiful


By mary_maureen_boyle on June 28, 2017Verified Purchase 


I love my wreath. It is fuller than pictured. it also has shiny branches with droplets that do not appear
in the picture. I do like it as pictured so I will cut the shiny branches off. Easy  fix to make it look exactly as pictured. Great price. LOVE HOUZZ!

What are some popular holiday decorations?Depending on the holiday or season you're decorating for, there are a lot of staple products to choose from. Christmas is arguably one of the most popular decorating holidays, both inside and outside the home. Christmas lights and wreaths are popular additions to your exterior, while Christmas trees, ornaments, tree skirts, stockings and garlands are popular indoors. Halloween pumpkins and lawn ornaments are common, while leaves and autumn wreaths are frequent in the fall. Try to pick Valentine’s Day decor that could also work for a little girl’s birthday party, Fourth of July decorations that can be used for other summer parties, and holiday decor that can stay out through New Year’s Eve.What style holiday decor should I buy?Color makes a world of difference when it comes to these decisions. Picking items in simple tones that go well with the overall style of your house means that you might be able to whip out those candleholders for more than one holiday party, or even keep them out for most of the season. Choosing Christmas decorations that have more of a “wintry” feel, or Halloween decorations that can be used for Thanksgiving and most of fall means you can get more bang for your buck when it comes to holiday decorations.

Have fun with wall decor.If your floor space is limited, it’s important to make the most of your walls by using every inch for home decor. If your walls are looking a little barren, spice them up with colorful artwork. Your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room, while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities. If storage is an issue, use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers. Don’t forget about the wall itself! Add some flavor with colorful, patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall. Home decorations make great table toppers.If your living room needs a lift, liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories. Photos always make great additions, but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames. When lit, candles add a romantic, relaxing feel, and coffee table books about travel, home design, fashion or photography make for great conversation starters. House decorations can cozy up your floor.While floor space may be limited, there’s always room for a well-placed area rug or two. These are a great way to add texture, color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor. Choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started, then pair your  pattern with a textured Berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence. Add some vibrancy to neutral-colored furniture. One of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display. Swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation, and search right here on Houzz for bold or mismatched patterns, comfy throws and cushy pillows. Don’t forget the drapes.Dress up your windows with elegant, bold or even light and airy treatments. Because of their size, floor-length curtains can make a dramatic difference and can transition a room from traditional to contemporary all by themselves.

Wreaths & Garlands

 4,199 Wreaths and Garlands
Originally placed on doors as a symbol of status or victory,  wreaths now create a festive and inviting entry into one’s home. Similarly, garlands add a touch of nature and green to our holiday décor with materials like evergreen branches, boxwood, holly and even deco mesh. Of course, a wreath need not just be for Christmas. You can choose to accessorize your front door with a variety of fall wreaths, spring wreaths and even Easter and Halloween wreaths. More
