Redhook Brewery View Website
Redhook was born out of the energy and spirit of the early 1980s in the heart of Seattle. While the term didn’t exist at the time, Redhook became one of America’s first craft breweries with its focus on creating “better beers.” From a modest start in a former transmission shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard to a Fremont trolley barn that housed The Trolleyman brewpub, to its current breweries in Woodinville, Wash., and Portsmouth, N.H., Redhook has become one of America’s most recognized craft breweries. Redhook will open a 10-barrel brewpub in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in the fall of 2016.

While Redhook has “grown up” over the past 30 years, one thing has never changed — Redhook is still brewing great beers like ESB, Long Hammer IPA, Audible Pale Ale and a variety of seasonal beers. Most importantly, Redhook has fun doing it. Redhook beers are available on draught and in bottles and cans around the country. For more information, visit www.redhook.com.

Widmer Brothers Brewing View Website
Founded in 1984, Widmer Brothers Brewing is celebrating 30 years of beer in 2014 and into 2015. Founders Kurt and Rob Widmer helped lead the Pacific Northwest craft beer movement in 1984 when, in their 20s, they began brewing unique interpretations of traditional German beer styles. In 1986, Widmer Brothers Brewing introduced the original American-style Hefeweizen, which elevated the brewery to national acclaim. Since then, Hefe has grown to become Oregon’s favorite craft beer and the brewery has continued to push the boundaries, developing a variety of beers with an unapologetic, uncompromised commitment to innovation.

Based in Portland, Ore., the brewery currently brews a variety of award-winning beers including Hefe, Upheaval IPA, Alchemy Pale Ale, Drop Top Amber Ale, a full seasonal lineup, and a series of limited edition beers. For more information about Widmer Brothers Brewing, visit www.widmerbrothers.com.

The Power of the Alliance
As the fifth largest craft brewing company in the U.S., Craft Brew Alliance is a leader in brewing, branding, and bringing to market some of the world’s best-loved American craft beers. We were originally formed in 2008 with the merger of two pioneering Pacific Northwest craft brewers — Redhook Brewery, established in Seattle in 1981, and Widmer Brothers Brewing, established in Portland, OR in 1984. The merger, the first of its kind in our industry, represented an innovative union between two fast-growing craft brewers that wanted to grow and meet the demand from an ever-expanding consumer base.
Together, as Craft Brew Alliance, Redhook and Widmer Brothers gained an expanded brewery footprint, shared resources and access to a seamless national distribution network that enabled them to bring originals like Widmer Brothers Hefe and Redhook ESB to beer lovers across the U.S.
Kona Brewing Co., Hawaii’s oldest and largest craft brewery established in 1994, was the third legacy brewer to join the Alliance in 2010, and today Kona is our largest brand family. Kona is a top 10 national craft beer brand, known for its distinctive Island-inspired brands such as Big Wave Golden Ale and Longboard Island Lager.
In addition to growing and nurturing distinctive brands rooted in local heritage, we are committed to developing innovative new category leaders, such as Omission Beer, established in 2012 and already the #1 beer in the gluten free beer category. Our tribute to the earliest pioneers, Square Mile Cider, was launched in 2013 and is now the #2 hard cider in the Pacific Northwest.
We are headquartered in beautiful Portland, OR, with brewing and restaurants located across the United States.


Commitment to Sustainability

As one of the largest craft brewing companies in the U.S., we believe we have a responsibility to be a leader in both the quality of our beers and the sustainable ways in which we make them. Sustainability is a cornerstone of our business, and we are committed to minimizing our environmental impact across our breweries and brewpubs. In addition to finding innovative ways to reduce our water and energy usage, we track our progress against annual targets each year. We’re proud to share our fourth annual Sustainability Report, which highlights some of our key focus areas and achievements across our brands and breweries. View our 2016  CBA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT here.
Fostering New Growth
We bring our passion for growing authentic craft beers and brands to life through strategic partnerships with emerging brands. In 2014, we forged a partnership with Appalachian Mountain Brewery, expanding the Alliance with the first craft brewery established in Boone, NC. In 2015, we entered a strategic partnership with Nantucket Island-based Cisco Brewers. Our strategic partners gain access to CBA’s world-class leadership and national infrastructure, including:

Brewing Services
Warehouse & Distribution Services
Wholesaler and Retail Sales Management
Marketing Services





Our Values

At Craft Brew Alliance, we believe that having the soul of a craft brewer in the body of a big brewer gives us a distinctive advantage. With more than three decades of craft beer experience under our belts, a powerful national infrastructure, and deep roots in the many communities we call home, we are uniquely built to address the shifting beer landscape and meet the increasing consumer demand for authentic local brews.
As we grow, our values ensure we remain true to who we are and true to the rich legacy that our craft beer pioneers entrusted to us. Over the years, we have evolved for an ever-changing industry, but what we stand for remains the same: CRAFT. Core to who we are, our values reflect a culture that prioritizes authenticity and collaboration over status and competition. They define what we stand for, and, more importantly, what we expect from each other. They remind us to behave in a way that honors our legacy while inspiring us to continue innovating and building our future. While some may question the definition of “craft,” we know what it is. It’s more than size, more than ingredients, and more than a label – it’s a testament to our passion for beer and a commitment to remain true – to our roots, to our consumers, and to our craft. We are Craft Brew Alliance, and these are our values:
Creativity – Great companies evolve and adapt. Rather than fear change, they embrace it. At CBA, we take risks and find new ways to achieve our goals because every day is an opportunity to learn. In this way, we stay agile, we inspire innovation, and we shape our future.
Respect – As one of the largest craft brewers in the country, we are conscientious about our impact – on our communities, our people and our environment. By fostering a culture of integrity and respect, we develop leaders who set positive examples, encourage diversity, and enable the vast potential of everyone around us.
Accountability – We call it like it is. We take responsibility for our actions, and we hold each other accountable to achieve the highest standards in quality and safety because our consumers, partners and employees deserve the best. It’s this commitment and authenticity that makes us who we are.
Fun – We love what we do and it shows in the quality of our beers and the passion of our engaged teams. We work hard at making CBA the great company it is today, and we also recognize the importance of enjoying the journey as much as the outcome.
Teamwork – CBA’s foundation is built on family and teamwork, and we strive to continue that legacy. We work to create an environment that is inclusive, inspires collaboration and fosters strong relationships. We look out for one another, we work towards common goals, and we celebrate our successes – often over one of our great beers!

Redhook Brewery View Website
Redhook was born out of the energy and spirit of the early 1980s in the heart of Seattle. While the term didn’t exist at the time, Redhook became one of America’s first craft breweries with its focus on creating “better beers.” From a modest start in a former transmission shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard to a Fremont trolley barn that housed The Trolleyman brewpub, to its current breweries in Woodinville, Wash., and Portsmouth, N.H., Redhook has become one of America’s most recognized craft breweries. Redhook will open a 10-barrel brewpub in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in the fall of 2016.

While Redhook has “grown up” over the past 30 years, one thing has never changed — Redhook is still brewing great beers like ESB, Long Hammer IPA, Audible Pale Ale and a variety of seasonal beers. Most importantly, Redhook has fun doing it. Redhook beers are available on draught and in bottles and cans around the country. For more information, visit www.redhook.com.

Widmer Brothers Brewing View Website
Founded in 1984, Widmer Brothers Brewing is celebrating 30 years of beer in 2014 and into 2015. Founders Kurt and Rob Widmer helped lead the Pacific Northwest craft beer movement in 1984 when, in their 20s, they began brewing unique interpretations of traditional German beer styles. In 1986, Widmer Brothers Brewing introduced the original American-style Hefeweizen, which elevated the brewery to national acclaim. Since then, Hefe has grown to become Oregon’s favorite craft beer and the brewery has continued to push the boundaries, developing a variety of beers with an unapologetic, uncompromised commitment to innovation.

Based in Portland, Ore., the brewery currently brews a variety of award-winning beers including Hefe, Upheaval IPA, Alchemy Pale Ale, Drop Top Amber Ale, a full seasonal lineup, and a series of limited edition beers. For more information about Widmer Brothers Brewing, visit www.widmerbrothers.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Craft Brew Alliance Is Overvalued | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Craft Brew Alliance Is OvervaluedJul. 17, 2017  7:39 AM ET|| Includes: BREW, BUDby: Nicholas KlemmNicholas Klemm Large-cap, long/short equity, Growth, medium-term horizonSummaryBREW has seen significant return over the last year.BREW has deteriorating financial performance.Several risk factors outweigh potential for a little more gain.Craft Brew Alliance, Inc (NASDAQ: BREW ) is a rising craft beer company. It includes several different brands of beer including Kona Brewing Company, Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Cisco Brewers, Omission Brewing Co, Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider Co, and Widmer Brothers Brewing. Craft Brew Alliance is one of the top six brewers in the craft brewing segment of the United States. While I believe that the craft beer industry is one to invest in, there are several reasons that I believe BREW is being severely overvalued. The popularity of Craft Brew Alliance brands is due to their agreement with A-B. A-B was granted certain contractual rights and held preferred shares that have been redeemed into 31.5% of outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. The contractual agreement allows A-B to designate two members on the board of directors as well as a designee on each committee. The contract has several downsides that will severely inhibit BREW. “The Exchange Agreement contains limitations on our ability to take certain actions without A-B’s prior consent, including, but not limited to, our ability to issue equity securities or acquire or sell assets or stock, amend our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, grant board representation rights, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, distribute our products in the United States other than through A-B or as provided in the A-B Distributor Agreement, or voluntarily terminate our listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.” This quote is directly taken from their 10-K. From this quote alone we can see that difficulties that BREW will have in the future. This contract will greatly restrict their ability to grow their brand or take advantage of other opportunities. While the resources from A-B are valuable, they are fully at the mercy of A-B. On top of these restrictions BREW pays fees to A-B in connection with the sale of their products including margin fees, invoicing, staging and cooperage handling fees, and inventory manager fees. A-B is essentially doubly dipping on BREW’s earnings. Not only does A-B earn a return from the company growing sales, they make money from fees on the sales as well. This give A-B a monopoly over BREW. A-B is able to charge fees and limit their ability to take any action without their prior approval. The monopoly that A-B has over BREW greatly dilutes the company’s earnings and potential. For example one stipulation of the agreement is that before acquiring another brewer if the purchase price exceeds $30 million or to purchase a non-brewing entity if the purchase prices exceeds $2 million BREW must obtain A-B consent.
 Another agreement has proven to hurt BREW. BREW previously had an agreement with Pabst Northwest Brewing Company. Under this agreement Pabst had the ability to brew selected Rainier Brewing company and other brands at their brewery in Woodinville, Washington under a license agreement. This contract was set to expire in December 31, 2018 but Pabst terminated the agreement, paying 6 million in a termination fee and giving up the option to purchase the brewery and adjacent pub as well as other assets at the property. While the extra cash for BREW is a upside, BREW ultimately had to shut down the site and move more of its brewing operations into A-B facilities. Another reason for alarm is in the 10-K BRW discusses a weakness with internal controls over financial reporting. “We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.” This important phrasing in this quote is “material”. Material in accounting means that it has the potential to affect the economic decision of users (investors). This is a major alarm for investors. The fact that these mistakes to the financial statements could be material is alarming and adds a severe amount of risk to the company and its future operations. Another major concern is BREW inability to operate breweries at their current designed capacities. The inability to do this will negatively impact their financial statements. According to their 10-K “actual production capacity will rarely, if ever, approach full working capacity”. Another major risk that investors must consider is how heavily BREW relies on intangible assets. As of December 31, 2016 intangible assets represented nearly 14.4% of total assets. Any economic recession or shift could cause significant losses on impairment. BREW has also seen decreases in many of its brands and sales. 2016 net sales saw a decrease of 1% with net income down $2.5 million which with BREW modest earnings is 113%. BREW also saw the number of barrels sold drop 6% from 2015 to 2016.
 I have been very interested in the craft beer market and have recently wrote another article about Boston Beer Company (NYSE:SAM). I believe that the craft beer industry provides a very unique opportunity for investors. The industry is growing very rapidly. The number of operating U.S. Breweries has grown 16.6% from 2015-2016. The south has seen an increase of more than 35 breweries in 2016 and created over 129,000 jobs in 2016 alone. There has been a significant increase in volume for craft brewers as well.   2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016   5.7% 6.5% 7.8% 11% 12.2% 12.3%   Returns have been very hit and miss depending on the company. SAM for instance has had a 5 year return of 27% (5.4% annually) and (NASDAQ:BREW) has had a 5 year return of 120% (24% annually). I recently wrote another article on why I thought SAM was a buy given the current trend of the craft beer market. Companies like BREW have seen the significant increase in their market cap. BREW has a trailing P/E of 302.63 and a forward P/E of 45.39. The industry trailing and forward P/E are 65.81 and 27.25. A full break down of the companies multiples can be found below:   TRAILING P/E Growth   BREW 302.63     INDUSTRY 65.81 18.26%     FORWARD P/E   BREW 45.39   INDUSTRY 27.25   We can see from the forward and trialing P/E that BREW is relatively expensive when compared to the market. Even with high earnings growth at its current price, BREW still has a P/E that is over 66% higher than the industry. There is another interesting correlation that is often overlooked. Often a high P/E can be explained due to the anticipation of sustained high growth or returns in the future. A high P/E is therefore correlated with a high beta. Beta is the measure of a risk that a company has relative to the industry. A beta of 1.0 means that the company is as risky as the market. Anything greater than 1 it is more risky and anything less than 1 is less risky relative to the market. The logic is that with a very high P/E you are expecting significant returns. A high beta will tell a similar story. A high beta tells you that the stock is risky relative to the market. What makes the investment worth the extra risk? Higher returns. Investors invest in companies with high betas because they are more risky and thus must require a higher return. The interesting thing about BREW is that it only has a beta of .50.
   High P/E Signals high expected growth/returns   High Beta More risk for more returns   A company with a beta of less than 1 is less risky than the market. With using the logic of risk vs return this should signal that BREW will not have significant return since it is less risky than the market. The correlation between a high P/E and high beta is often overlooked. BREW lacks that correlation and that can often be a sign it is not currently valued correctly. Firms that have high betas thus require higher returns. Firm’s that have high P/E expect large growth to justify the higher P/E and eventually settle back to the industry average once the high growth slows. A major concern regarding sales is the decrease of many of their brands. When first looking at total sales there is not much to worry about their current position. However, this table of shipments by Brand should begin to worry investors.

 We can see from this table just how significant their other brands have decreased. Widmer and Redhook are two of the company’s biggest brands and they continue to suffer significant declines. Shipments of Widmer are down almost 16% and depletions dropped almost 24% for RedHook with a 31% decrease in barrels shipped. It is difficult to value this company quantitatively for several reasons. First, BREW has not had any free cash flow in the last 4 years (Source: Morningstar Direct).   Year 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012   FCF -8 -4 -6 -1 4   Another option is to run a DCF using EPS. This is also difficult due to the fact that BREW has had a decreasing EPS for the last 6 years.   Year 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011   EPS -.20 .12 .16 .10 .13 .51   % Change -267% -25% 60% -23% -75%     As we can see the EPS has not been stable over the last several years. For this reason that means my valuation will not hold weight if the assumptions used in it are not expected to stay consistent over several years. With that said I did value BREW using DCF with EPS in place of free cash flow. I used a WACC of 5.13%. I also used the TTM EPS that is provided by Morningstar:.06. I assumed that given the increasing popularity of Kona and short term benefits that BREW will see with the partnership with A-B they could see high growth for 4 years at a 10% growth rate and 2% terminally.
   Year 1 2 3 4 Terminal   EPS .066 .073 .080 .088 2.86   Discounted EPS .063 .066 .069 .072 2.34   This gives me a final valuation of $2.61 a share. This is a drastic decline from its current price. In order to understand these valuation investors must realize that BREW is trading on growth alone. When looking at the financial statements, they have consistently had negative FCF. FCF is the free cash that can go to investors. Also BREW has had decreasing EPS that have even gone negative. Quantitatively it is easy to see why this company is hard to value. Lastly, the company does not pay any dividends and does not plan to in the future. With the agreement BREW has with their bank, they are unable to pay dividends to investors without meeting certain requirements with the bank. BREW has also not been buying back common equity and advises its investors that it can only expect return from appreciation of common stock. Conclusion BREW has seen a significant increase in price over the last year. Most of this is due to its partnership with A-B. While this partnership has several short term benefits like exposure to all 50 states it will ultimately inhibit their ability to function as a company in the future. The restrictions that A-B has in the long-term will prove to limit their ability to make decisions and investments in the opportunities that the Craft Beer industry provides. Its agreements with their bank for line of credit and loans are also keeping the company from paying its investors any time in the near future. Its decreasing sales in its other beers are also worrying. There has been significant growth in its Kona brand but its two other largest brands have seen decreasing sales. The material effect of its inefficient internal controls is also something that must be strongly considered. Lastly when you look at their financial statements you can see the company is not performing well. They had a negative EPS in 2016 and decreasing FCF and EPS over the last several years. BREW is severely overvalued and is a strong sell.
 Author's update dated July 25, 2017: The agreement between A-B and BREW has existed for 30+ years; the mention of short term has to do with the benefits of the agreement that I believe will help BREW in the short term but not in the long term.

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on July 1, 2008,[6][7] with the merger of Redhook Ale Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewery. CBA acquired Kona Brewing Company on October 1, 2010. In 2012, CBA launched a new brand called "Omission" beer, promoting the beer as specially crafted to remove gluten. In 2013, CBA launched a cider - Square Mile Cider, and in 2014 entered into a partnership with The Chive to create KCCO beer under the independent/Chive-owned Resignation Brewery moniker.[8]
The company was originally named Craft Brewers Alliance, but changed its name to Craft Brew Alliance on January 12, 2012.[9]
As of March 15, 2012, Craft Brew Alliance is publicly traded as NASDAQ: BREW. Prior to this date it was publicly traded as HOOK.[10]
Products[edit]
The company produces brands such as Redhook, Widmer Brothers Brewing, Omission Beer and several others.[11]

On May 20, 2015, CBA announced the appointment of Joe Vandersteldt to CFO, along with several other changes at the executive leadership level.[14][15]
Redhook[edit]
Redhook was founded in the early 1980s in Seattle. At first, the brewery was a small shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard. The beers brewed by Redhook include ESB, IPA, Pilsner, Copperhook, and seasonal brews.[11]
Widmer Brothers Brewing[edit]
Widmer Brothers brews various beers including Drifter Pale Ale, Nelson Imperial IPA, Rotator IPA Series, Drop Top Amber Ale, Pitch Black IPA, and Upheaval IPA.
Kona Brewing Company[edit]
The Kona Brewing Company was founded in the spring of 1994 and is Hawaii's largest brewery.[11]
Omission Beer[edit]
The company's Omission beer is designed to have low gluten content by using a proprietary enzyme to remove gluten from traditional beer ingredients - namely malted barley.[16]
Square Mile Cider Company[edit]
Launched in 2013, there are two primary products under this brand - "The Original" which is a traditional hard apple cider; and "Spur & Vine", which is a "hopped apple cider".
Appalachian Mountain Brewery[edit]
On December 2, 2014, CBA entered into a strategic partnership agreement with Boone, NC-based Appalachian Mountain Brewery (AMB).[17] As part of the partnership, CBA will act as "master distributor" for AMB, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network.

Use of the term "craft brew"[edit]
While the company name contains the phrase "craft brew", it does not meet the definition of a craft brewer according to the Brewers Association,[20] due to the percentage stake owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev.[3][21][22][23] The Brewers Association defines American craft brewers as "small, independent and traditional", with 'small' defined as an "annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less", a limit changed in 2011 from 2 million to 6 million to ensure the ongoing inclusion of Boston Beer Company[24] (the producer of the Samuel Adams brand), 'independent' defined as at least 75% owned or controlled by a craft brewer, and 'traditional' defined as at least 50% of its volume being all malt beer.[20][23]

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWHOOK » Topics » ProductsThese excerpts taken from the HOOK 10-K filed Mar 27, 2009.Products

 

    The Company produces a variety of specialty craft beers using
    traditional European brewing methods. The Company brews its
    beers using only high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye
    and other natural ingredients, and does not use any rice, corn,
    sugar, syrups or other adjuncts. The Companys beers are
    marketed on the basis of freshness and distinctive flavor
    profiles. To help maintain full flavor, the Companys
    products are not pasteurized. As a result, it is suggested that
    they be kept cool so that oxidation and heat-induced aging will
    not adversely affect the original taste, and that they be
    distributed and served as soon as possible, generally within
    three or four months after packaging to maximize freshness and
    flavor. The Company distributes its products in glass bottles
    and kegs. The Company expects to begin distributing in the
    second quarter of 2009 its beer in 5-liter steel cans. The
    Company applies a freshness date to its products for the benefit
    of wholesalers and consumers.

 

    The Companys products are divided into three primary brand
    families: Widmer Brothers Beers and Redhook Beers, both of which
    it owns, and Kona Brewing, which it offers through a
    distribution agreement with Kona. The Company also utilizes its
    relationship with FSB to market product offerings by Goose
    Island as complementary to these brand families. In addition,
    the Company also brews and sells in select markets Pacific
    Ridge Pale Ale through a licensing arrangement with A-B.
    This beer is offered only on draft.

 

Widmer
    Brothers Beers

 

Widmer Hefeweizen.  Available year-round. The
    top selling beer within the brand family is a golden, cloudy
    wheat beer with a pronounced citrus aroma and flavor. This beer
    is intentionally left unfiltered to create its unique appearance
    and flavor profile and is usually served with a lemon slice to
    enhance the beers natural citrus notes. This beers
    relatively low alcohol content by volume makes it perfect for
    consumption as a session beer. Its most recent award, among
    many, was the 2008 World Cup Gold medal winner for the
    American-style Hefeweizen category.

 

Drifter Pale Ale
    (Drifter).  Available year-round
    beginning in 2009. This beer possesses a unique citrus
    character, smooth drinkability, and a distinctive hop character.

New Products and Brands.  In an effort
    to remain current with shifting consumer style and flavor
    preferences, the Company routinely analyzes its brand families
    and product offering to identify beer styles or consumer taste
    preferences that it is under serving or missing entirely. After
    identifying a potentially new product offering, the Company will
    attempt to determine whether it may have offered this style in a
    previous incarnation, either on a one-time basis or as a limited
    run seasonal. When the Company determines that it has previously
    brewed this style or taste profile, the Companys marketing
    department may modify the brand

    identity and the associated packaging as required to align with
    the stated consumer preference. Several of the Companys
    current offerings, including Drifter and Broken Halo,
    were developed through this process. In the case where the
    Company has not brewed this style or taste profile in the past,
    it may use its Rose Quarter pilot brewhouse to brew an
    experimental or new beer. The Company then may offer this
    experimental or new brew directly to consumers through
    on-premise test marketing at its own pubs and exclusive retail
    sites or it may refine this product through customer preference
    and focus group testing. If the initial consumer reception of an
    experimental or new brew appears to meet the desired taste
    profile, the Company develops a brand identity to solidify the
    consumer perception of the product. Drop Top is an
    example of a product offering developed by the Company in this
    manner. The Company believes that its continued success will be
    based on its ability to be attentive and responsive to consumer
    desires for new and distinctive tastes, and capacity to meet
    these desires with original and novel taste profiles while
    maintaining consistently high product quality.

 

Contract brewing.  Prior to the Merger, the
    Company also sold Widmer Hefeweizen in the Midwest and
    Eastern United States under an arrangement with Widmer.
    Beginning in 2003, the Company entered into a licensing
    agreement with Widmer to produce and sell the Widmer
    Hefeweizen product in states east of the Mississippi River.
    In March 2007, the distribution territory was expanded to
    include all of the Companys Midwest markets, and then
    modified again in the fourth quarter of 2007, when Widmer
    exercised its contractual right to exclude the state of Texas
    from the distribution territory. The licensing agreement
    automatically renewed on February 1, 2008 and was in effect
    until the Merger was consummated. In conjunction with this
    agreement, Redhook discontinued brewing and selling its
    Hefe-weizen brand beer, and during the term
    of this agreement, Redhook did not brew, advertise, market, or
    distribute any product that was labeled or advertised as a
    Hefeweizen or any similar product in the
    agreed-upon
    Midwest and eastern territory. The Company believes that this
    agreement increased capacity utilization and strengthened the
    Companys product portfolio. Pursuant to the licensing
    arrangement, the Company shipped 12,500 and 28,800 barrels
    of Widmer Hefeweizen during the first six months of 2008
    and for the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively.
    Licensing fees paid to Widmer under this agreement totaling
    $165,000 and $432,000 are reflected in the Companys
    statements of operations for the corresponding periods.

 

Products

 

    The Company produces a variety of specialty craft beers using
    traditional European brewing methods. The Company brews its
    beers using only high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye
    and other natural ingredients, and does not use any rice, corn,
    sugar, syrups or other adjuncts. The Companys beers are
    marketed on the basis of freshness and distinctive flavor
    profiles. To help maintain full flavor, the Companys
    products are not pasteurized. As a result, it is suggested that
    they be kept cool so that oxidation and heat-induced aging will
    not adversely affect the original taste, and that they be
    distributed and served as soon as possible, generally within
    three or four months after packaging to maximize freshness and
    flavor. The Company distributes its products in glass bottles
    and kegs. The Company expects to begin distributing in the
    second quarter of 2009 its beer in 5-liter steel cans. The
    Company applies a freshness date to its products for the benefit
    of wholesalers and consumers.

 

    The Companys products are divided into three primary brand
    families: Widmer Brothers Beers and Redhook Beers, both of which
    it owns, and Kona Brewing, which it offers through a
    distribution agreement with Kona. The Company also utilizes its
    relationship with FSB to market product offerings by Goose
    Island as complementary to these brand families. In addition,
    the Company also brews and sells in select markets Pacific
    Ridge Pale Ale through a licensing arrangement with A-B.

    identity and the associated packaging as required to align with
    the stated consumer preference. Several of the Companys
    current offerings, including Drifter and Broken Halo,
    were developed through this process. In the case where the
    Company has not brewed this style or taste profile in the past,
    it may use its Rose Quarter pilot brewhouse to brew an
    experimental or new beer. The Company then may offer this
    experimental or new brew directly to consumers through
    on-premise test marketing at its own pubs and exclusive retail
    sites or it may refine this product through customer preference
    and focus group testing. If the initial consumer reception of an
    experimental or new brew appears to meet the desired taste
    profile, the Company develops a brand identity to solidify the
    consumer perception of the product. Drop Top is an
    example of a product offering developed by the Company in this
    manner. The Company believes that its continued success will be
    based on its ability to be attentive and responsive to consumer
    desires for new and distinctive tastes, and capacity to meet
    these desires with original and novel taste profiles while
    maintaining consistently high product quality.

 

Contract brewing.  Prior to the Merger, the
    Company also sold Widmer Hefeweizen in the Midwest and
    Eastern United States under an arrangement with Widmer.
    Beginning in 2003, the Company entered into a licensing
    agreement with Widmer to produce and sell the Widmer
    Hefeweizen product in states east of the Mississippi River.
    In March 2007, the distribution territory was expanded to
    include all of the Companys Midwest markets, and then
    modified again in the fourth quarter of 2007, when Widmer
    exercised its contractual right to exclude the state of Texas
    from the distribution territory. The licensing agreement
    automatically renewed on February 1, 2008 and was in effect
    until the Merger was consummated. In conjunction with this
    agreement, Redhook discontinued brewing and selling its
    Hefe-weizen brand beer, and during the term
    of this agreement, Redhook did not brew, advertise, market, or
    distribute any product that was labeled or advertised as a
    Hefeweizen or any similar product in the
    agreed-upon
    Midwest and eastern territory. The Company believes that this
    agreement increased capacity utilization and strengthened the
    Companys product portfolio. Pursuant to the licensing
    arrangement, the Company shipped 12,500 and 28,800 barrels
    of Widmer Hefeweizen during the first six months of 2008
    and for the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively.
    Licensing fees paid to Widmer under this agreement totaling
    $165,000 and $432,000 are reflected in the Companys
    statements of operations for the corresponding periods.

    The Company produces a variety of specialty craft beers using
    traditional European brewing methods. The Company brews its
    beers using only high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye
    and other natural ingredients, and does not use any rice, corn,
    sugar, syrups or other adjuncts. The Companys beers are
    marketed on the basis of freshness and distinctive flavor
    profiles. To help maintain full flavor, the Companys
    products are not pasteurized. As a result, it is appropriate
    that they be kept cool so that oxidation and heat-induced aging
    will not adversely affect the original taste, and that they be
    distributed and served as soon as possible, generally within
    three months after packaging, to maximize freshness and flavor.
    The Company distributes its products only in glass bottles and
    kegs, and its products are freshness dated for the benefit of
    wholesalers and consumers.

 

    The Company currently produces nine principal brands, each with
    its own distinctive combination of flavor, color and clarity:

 

Redhook ESB (ESB).  The
    Companys flagship brand, ESB, which accounted for
    approximately 28%, 36% and 47% of the Companys shipments
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is a rich, copper-colored
    ale styled by a complex balance between the bitterness of the
    hops and the sweetness of a heavier caramel malting.. Shipments
    of ESB, as a percentage of total Company shipments, have
    declined over the past three years as a result of increases in
    sales of Redhooks other products, particularly Redhook
    Long Hammer IPA, seasonal offerings, variety packs, licensed
    Widmer Hefeweizen as well as beer brewed on a contract
    basis for Widmer.

 

Long Hammer IPA (Long Hammer).  A
    premium English, pub-style bitter ale, Long Hammer,
    accounted for approximately 19%, 16% and 17% of the
    Companys shipments in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Long Hammer has a strong hop profile that takes advantage
    of dry-hopping and Cascade hops because they impart a wonderful
    aroma without an overpowering hop taste.

 

Redhook Blonde Ale.  A delicious,
    thirst-quenching golden ale, the combination of lightly roasted
    barley, subtle hops, and a touch of wheat creates a perfectly
    balanced and distinctively drinkable ale.

 

Blackhook Porter (Blackhook).  A
    London-style porter, Blackhook has an ebony tone, a
    pleasant toasted character produced by highly
    roasted barley, and a dark malt flavor suggesting coffee and
    chocolate, balanced by lively hopping.

 

Copperhook Ale (Copperhook).  This
    ale is cold fermented so beer drinkers can enjoy the full flavor
    characteristics. With its brilliant copper color, Copperhook
    has a light maltiness, pleasant hop aroma, and distinctive
    citrus flavor.

 

Redhook Sunrye Ale
    (Sunrye).  Gently roasted barley,
    delicate hops and a touch of rye combine for a very balanced
    lighter style ale. Slightly unfiltered to exude a pearl glow,
    Sunrye is styled for warm weather refreshment. Sunrye
    is available from April through September in western markets
    and April through July in midwest and eastern markets.

 

Late Harvest Autumn Ale (Autumn
    Ale).  A roasted malt aroma and distinct
    flavors of the Northern Brewer and Saaz hops mark this
    full-bodied ale. The two row barley foundation malt gives
    Autumn Ale its full body. The specialty malts
     Crystal, German Smoked Munich, Caramel and
    Roasted  give it a rich complexity. Autumn Ale
    is available August to September in midwest and eastern
    markets.

 

Winterhook.  A rich, seasonal holiday ale
    formulated specially each year for cold-weather enjoyment,
    Winterhook typically is deep in color and rich in flavor,
    with complex flavors and a warm finish. Typically, the Company
    changes the style of this ale each year. Winterhook is
    available during fall and winter months.

 

    The Company also sells Widmer Hefeweizen in the midwest
    and eastern U.S. under license from Widmer. Widmer
    Hefeweizen is a golden unfiltered wheat beer and is one of
    the leading American style Hefeweizens sold in the U.S. In
    2003, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Widmer
    to produce and sell

    the Widmer Hefeweizen brand in states east of the
    Mississippi River. In March 2006, the Widmer Hefeweizen
    distribution territory was expanded to include all of the
    Companys midwest and eastern markets. In the fourth
    quarter of 2006, the Widmer Hefeweizen distribution
    territory was again modified when Widmer exercised its
    contractual right to eliminate Texas from the Companys
    Widmer Hefeweizen distribution territory. Brewing of this
    product is conducted at the New Hampshire Brewery under the
    supervision and assistance of Widmers brewing staff to
    insure the brands quality and matching taste profile. The
    licensing agreement automatically renewed on February 1,
    2008 for an additional one-year term expiring on
    February 1, 2009. The agreement provides for additional
    one-year automatic renewals unless either party notifies the
    other of its desire to have the agreement expire at the end of
    the then existing term at least 150 days prior to such
    expiration. The agreement may also be terminated by either party
    at any time without cause pursuant to 150 days notice or
    for cause by either party under certain conditions.
    Additionally, the Company and Widmer have entered into a
    secondary agreement providing that if Widmer terminates the
    licensing agreement or causes it to expire before
    December 31, 2009, Widmer will pay the Company a lump sum
    payment to partially compensate the Company for capital
    equipment expenditures made at the New Hampshire Brewery to
    support Widmers growth. During the term of this agreement,
    Redhook will not brew, advertise, market, or distribute any
    product that is labeled or advertised as a
    Hefeweizen or any similar product in the agreed upon
    midwest and eastern territory. Brewing and selling of
    Redhooks Hefe-weizen was discontinued in conjunction with
    this agreement. The Company believes that this agreement
    increases capacity utilization and has strengthened the
    Companys product portfolio. The Company shipped 28,800,
    30,600 and 25,600 barrels of Widmer Hefeweizen
    during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. A licensing fee of $432,000, $437,000 and
    $399,000 due to Widmer is reflected in the Companys
    statement of operations for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If the Widmer licensing
    agreement were terminated early, the Company would need to look
    to replace the lost volume, either through new or existing
    Redhook products or alternative brewing relationships. If the
    Company were unable to replace the lost Widmer volume, the loss
    of revenue and the resulting excess capacity in the New
    Hampshire Brewery would have an adverse effect on the
    Companys financial performance.

 

    The Company also sells Pacific Ridge in the western
    U.S. In 2003, the Company entered into a purchase and sale
    agreement with A-B for the purchase of the Pacific Ridge
    brand, trademark and related intellectual property. In
    consideration, the Company agreed to pay A-B a fee for
    20 years based upon the Companys sales of the brand.
    The Company shipped 5,100, 5,900, and 6,000 barrels of
    Pacific Ridge during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A
    fee of $71,000, $80,000 and $83,000 due to A-B is reflected in
    the Companys statement of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

 

    In an effort to be responsive to varying consumer style and
    flavor preferences, the Company periodically engages in the
    development and testing of new products. The Company believes
    that the continued success of craft brewers will be affected by
    their ability to be innovative and attentive to consumer desires
    for new and distinctive taste experiences while maintaining
    consistently high product quality. The Companys breweries
    allow it to produce small-batch experimental ales within three
    weeks. Experimental products are periodically developed and
    typically produced in draft form only for on-premise test
    marketing at the Companys pubs and selected retail sites.
    If the initial consumer reception of an experimental brew is
    sufficiently positive, then its taste and formula are refined,
    as necessary, and a new Redhook brand may be created. Long
    Hammer, Redhook Blonde Ale and many of the Companys
    seasonal offerings are examples of products that were developed
    in this manner.

    The Company currently produces nine principal brands, each with
    its own distinctive combination of flavor, color and clarity:

 

Redhook ESB (ESB).  The
    Companys flagship brand, ESB, which accounted for
    approximately 28%, 36% and 47% of the Companys shipments
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is a rich, copper-colored
    ale styled by a complex balance between the bitterness of the

    Long Hammer IPA, seasonal offerings, variety packs, licensed
    Widmer Hefeweizen as well as beer brewed on a contract
    basis for Widmer.

 

Long Hammer IPA (Long Hammer).  A
    premium English, pub-style bitter ale, Long Hammer,
    accounted for approximately 19%, 16% and 17% of the
    Companys shipments in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Long Hammer has a strong hop profile that takes advantage

    Sunrye is styled for warm weather refreshment. Sunrye
    is available from April through September in western markets
    and April through July in midwest and eastern markets.

 

Late Harvest Autumn Ale (Autumn
    Ale).  A roasted malt aroma and distinct
    flavors of the Northern Brewer and Saaz hops mark this
    full-bodied ale. The two row barley foundation malt gives
    Autumn Ale its full body. The specialty malts
     Crystal, German Smoked Munich, Caramel and
    Roasted  give it a rich complexity. Autumn Ale
    is available August to September in midwest and eastern

    Winterhook typically is deep in color and rich in flavor,
    with complex flavors and a warm finish. Typically, the Company
    changes the style of this ale each year. Winterhook is
    available during fall and winter months.

 

    The Company also sells Widmer Hefeweizen in the midwest
    and eastern U.S. under license from Widmer. Widmer
    Hefeweizen is a golden unfiltered wheat beer and is one of
    the leading American style Hefeweizens sold in the U.S. In
    2003, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Widmer
    to produce and sell

    the Widmer Hefeweizen brand in states east of the
    Mississippi River. In March 2006, the Widmer Hefeweizen
    distribution territory was expanded to include all of the
    Companys midwest and eastern markets. In the fourth
    quarter of 2006, the Widmer Hefeweizen distribution
    territory was again modified when Widmer exercised its
    contractual right to eliminate Texas from the Companys
    Widmer Hefeweizen distribution territory. Brewing of this
    product is conducted at the New Hampshire Brewery under the
    supervision and assistance of Widmers brewing staff to
    insure the brands quality and matching taste profile. The
    licensing agreement automatically renewed on February 1,
    2008 for an additional one-year term expiring on
    February 1, 2009. The agreement provides for additional
    one-year automatic renewals unless either party notifies the
    other of its desire to have the agreement expire at the end of
    the then existing term at least 150 days prior to such
    expiration. The agreement may also be terminated by either party
    at any time without cause pursuant to 150 days notice or
    for cause by either party under certain conditions.
    Additionally, the Company and Widmer have entered into a
    secondary agreement providing that if Widmer terminates the
    licensing agreement or causes it to expire before
    December 31, 2009, Widmer will pay the Company a lump sum
    payment to partially compensate the Company for capital
    equipment expenditures made at the New Hampshire Brewery to
    support Widmers growth. During the term of this agreement,
    Redhook will not brew, advertise, market, or distribute any
    product that is labeled or advertised as a
    Hefeweizen or any similar product in the agreed upon
    midwest and eastern territory. Brewing and selling of
    Redhooks Hefe-weizen was discontinued in conjunction with
    this agreement. The Company believes that this agreement
    increases capacity utilization and has strengthened the
    Companys product portfolio. The Company shipped 28,800,
    30,600 and 25,600 barrels of Widmer Hefeweizen
    during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. A licensing fee of $432,000, $437,000 and
    $399,000 due to Widmer is reflected in the Companys
    statement of operations for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If the Widmer licensing
    agreement were terminated early, the Company would need to look
    to replace the lost volume, either through new or existing
    Redhook products or alternative brewing relationships. If the
    Company were unable to replace the lost Widmer volume, the loss
    of revenue and the resulting excess capacity in the New
    Hampshire Brewery would have an adverse effect on the
    Companys financial performance.

 

    The Company also sells Pacific Ridge in the western
    U.S. In 2003, the Company entered into a purchase and sale
    agreement with A-B for the purchase of the Pacific Ridge
    brand, trademark and related intellectual property. In
    consideration, the Company agreed to pay A-B a fee for
    20 years based upon the Companys sales of the brand.
    The Company shipped 5,100, 5,900, and 6,000 barrels of
    Pacific Ridge during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A
    fee of $71,000, $80,000 and $83,000 due to A-B is reflected in
    the Companys statement of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

 

    In an effort to be responsive to varying consumer style and
    flavor preferences, the Company periodically engages in the
    development and testing of new products. The Company believes
    that the continued success of craft brewers will be affected by
    their ability to be innovative and attentive to consumer desires
    for new and distinctive taste experiences while maintaining
    consistently high product quality. The Companys breweries
    allow it to produce small-batch experimental ales within three
    weeks. Experimental products are periodically developed and
    typically produced in draft form only for on-premise test
    marketing at the Companys pubs and selected retail sites.
    If the initial consumer reception of an experimental brew is
    sufficiently positive, then its taste and formula are refined,
    as necessary, and a new Redhook brand may be created. Long
    Hammer, Redhook Blonde Ale and many of the Companys
    seasonal offerings are examples of products that were developed
    in this manner.

 

Products     The Company produces a variety of specialty craft beers using    traditional European brewing methods. The Company brews its    beers using only high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye    and other natural ingredients, and does not use any rice, corn,    sugar, syrups or other adjuncts. The Companys beers are    marketed on the basis of freshness and distinctive flavor    profiles. To help maintain full flavor, the Companys    products are not pasteurized. As a result, it is appropriate    that they be kept cool so that oxidation and heat-induced aging    will not adversely affect the original taste, and that they be    distributed and served as soon as possible, generally within    three months after packaging, to maximize freshness and flavor.    The Company distributes its products only in glass bottles and    kegs, and its products are freshness dated for the benefit of    wholesalers and consumers.     The Company currently produces nine principal brands, each with    its own distinctive combination of flavor, color and clarity:  Redhook ESB (ESB).  The    Companys flagship brand, ESB, which accounted for    approximately 28%, 36% and 47% of the Companys shipments    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is a rich, copper-colored    ale styled by a complex balance between the bitterness of the    hops and the sweetness of a heavier caramel malting.. Shipments    of ESB, as a percentage of total Company shipments, have    declined over the past three years as a result of increases in    sales of Redhooks other products, particularly Redhook    Long Hammer IPA, seasonal offerings, variety packs, licensed Widmer Hefeweizen as well as beer brewed on a contract    basis for Widmer.  Long Hammer IPA (Long Hammer).  A    premium English, pub-style bitter ale, Long Hammer,    accounted for approximately 19%, 16% and 17% of the    Companys shipments in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Long Hammer has a strong hop profile that takes advantage    of dry-hopping and Cascade hops because they impart a wonderful    aroma without an overpowering hop taste.  Redhook Blonde Ale.  A delicious,    thirst-quenching golden ale, the combination of lightly roasted    barley, subtle hops, and a touch of wheat creates a perfectly    balanced and distinctively drinkable ale.  Blackhook Porter (Blackhook).  A    London-style porter, Blackhook has an ebony tone, a    pleasant toasted character produced by highly    roasted barley, and a dark malt flavor suggesting coffee and    chocolate, balanced by lively hopping.  Copperhook Ale (Copperhook).  This    ale is cold fermented so beer drinkers can enjoy the full flavor    characteristics. With its brilliant copper color, Copperhook has a light maltiness, pleasant hop aroma, and distinctive    citrus flavor.  Redhook Sunrye Ale    (Sunrye).  Gently roasted barley,    delicate hops and a touch of rye combine for a very balanced    lighter style ale. Slightly unfiltered to exude a pearl glow, Sunrye is styled for warm weather refreshment. Sunrye is available from April through September in western markets    and April through July in midwest and eastern markets.  Late Harvest Autumn Ale (Autumn    Ale).  A roasted malt aroma and distinct    flavors of the Northern Brewer and Saaz hops mark this    full-bodied ale. The two row barley foundation malt gives Autumn Ale its full body. The specialty malts     Crystal, German Smoked Munich, Caramel and    Roasted  give it a rich complexity. Autumn Ale is available August to September in midwest and eastern    markets.  Winterhook.  A rich, seasonal holiday ale    formulated specially each year for cold-weather enjoyment, Winterhook typically is deep in color and rich in flavor,    with complex flavors and a warm finish. Typically, the Company    changes the style of this ale each year. Winterhook is    available during fall and winter months.     The Company also sells Widmer Hefeweizen in the midwest    and eastern U.S. under license from Widmer. Widmer    Hefeweizen is a golden unfiltered wheat beer and is one of    the leading American style Hefeweizens sold in the U.S. In    2003, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Widmer    to produce and sell     5Table of Contents    the Widmer Hefeweizen brand in states east of the    Mississippi River. In March 2006, the Widmer Hefeweizen distribution territory was expanded to include all of the    Companys midwest and eastern markets. In the fourth    quarter of 2006, the Widmer Hefeweizen distribution    territory was again modified when Widmer exercised its    contractual right to eliminate Texas from the Companys Widmer Hefeweizen distribution territory. Brewing of this    product is conducted at the New Hampshire Brewery under the    supervision and assistance of Widmers brewing staff to    insure the brands quality and matching taste profile. The    licensing agreement automatically renewed on February 1,    2008 for an additional one-year term expiring on    February 1, 2009. The agreement provides for additional    one-year automatic renewals unless either party notifies the    other of its desire to have the agreement expire at the end of    the then existing term at least 150 days prior to such    expiration. The agreement may also be terminated by either party    at any time without cause pursuant to 150 days notice or    for cause by either party under certain conditions.    Additionally, the Company and Widmer have entered into a    secondary agreement providing that if Widmer terminates the    licensing agreement or causes it to expire before    December 31, 2009, Widmer will pay the Company a lump sum    payment to partially compensate the Company for capital    equipment expenditures made at the New Hampshire Brewery to    support Widmers growth. During the term of this agreement,    Redhook will not brew, advertise, market, or distribute any    product that is labeled or advertised as a    Hefeweizen or any similar product in the agreed upon    midwest and eastern territory. Brewing and selling of    Redhooks Hefe-weizen was discontinued in conjunction with    this agreement. The Company believes that this agreement    increases capacity utilization and has strengthened the    Companys product portfolio. The Company shipped 28,800,    30,600 and 25,600 barrels of Widmer Hefeweizen during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and    2005, respectively. A licensing fee of $432,000, $437,000 and    $399,000 due to Widmer is reflected in the Companys    statement of operations for the years ended December 31,    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If the Widmer licensing    agreement were terminated early, the Company would need to look    to replace the lost volume, either through new or existing    Redhook products or alternative brewing relationships. If the    Company were unable to replace the lost Widmer volume, the loss    of revenue and the resulting excess capacity in the New    Hampshire Brewery would have an adverse effect on the    Companys financial performance.     The Company also sells Pacific Ridge in the western    U.S. In 2003, the Company entered into a purchase and sale    agreement with A-B for the purchase of the Pacific Ridge brand, trademark and related intellectual property. In    consideration, the Company agreed to pay A-B a fee for    20 years based upon the Companys sales of the brand.    The Company shipped 5,100, 5,900, and 6,000 barrels of Pacific Ridge during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A    fee of $71,000, $80,000 and $83,000 due to A-B is reflected in    the Companys statement of operations for the years ended    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.     In an effort to be responsive to varying consumer style and    flavor preferences, the Company periodically engages in the    development and testing of new products.

History

Food Pairing






The Right Blend of Ingredients and Imagination

	Blue Moon® Belgian White* was our first year-round release back in 1995.


	It started with our brewmaster, Keith Villa, wanting to craft a beer inspired by the flavorful Belgian Wits he enjoyed while studying brewing in Belgium. He brewed his interpretation using Valencia orange peel versus the traditional tart Curaçao orange peel, for a subtle sweetness, and added a touch of coriander to provide balance. Then he added oats and wheat to create a smooth, creamy finish that’s inviting to the palate. As a final touch, he garnished the beer with an orange slice to heighten the citrus aroma and taste. Its natural unfiltered appearance adds to the depth of flavors in Belgian White*.


	Available in 12-oz. bottles, 6-pack, 12-pack, 12-oz. can, 16-oz. can, Draft





Ingredients and Profile

Malts: Pale, White Wheat, Oats  Hops: Blend of Imported and Domestic   Our Twist: Valencia Orange Peel , Coriander  IBUs: 9   Original Gravity: 13º Plato  ABV: 5.4%  

Glassware
																Pour our Belgian White* into our signature Blue Moon® glass to highlight the depth of the beer. This glass opens wide at the top to make room for the aromatic citrus notes. Cap with a creamy, white head and garnish with an orange slice.															

Appearance
																Will appear cloudy because it’s unfiltered for more depth of flavor.															

Aroma
																You’ll notice a zesty orange fruitiness with a light spicy wheat aroma.															

Taste
																The flavor starts crisp and tangy and ends with a coriander and orange spiciness. The Valencia orange peel gives a subtle sweetness to the beer.															

Mouthfeel
																The oats give the beer a nice creamy body, so it’s not too thin.															

Finish
																Our Belgian White* has a slow finish of coriander and orange spiciness.															




Food Pairing
 
The Valencia orange peel and coriander in Blue Moon Belgian White pairs well with seafood such as grilled shrimp, Asian dishes like pad thai, and marinated chicken dishes.

Best Of Both Styles

	For our white IPA our brew masters wanted to combine the citrus flavors of an IPA with the smooth, balanced malts of a Belgian white Belgian-Style Wheat Ale. They began by experimenting with hop after hop until they found the perfect combination of four hops, including a rare German hop called Huell Melon. The result is a pronounced citrus and fruity hop taste, perfectly balanced by wheat, coriander, and orange peel. We bring the best of two styles together to craft an IPA with a unique twist. Hoppy. Unfiltered. Balanced.


	Available in 12-oz. bottles, 6-packs, and draft in select markets. Available nationally April 1, 2015.





Ingredients and Profile

Malts: Wheat, Oats  Hops: Simcoe, Cascade, Citra®   Our Twist: Use of the Huell Melon Hop from Germany  IBUs: 45   ABV: 5.9%  

Glassware
																We recommend Blue Moon Signature Glassware to showcase the beer’s pale, cloudy appearance and to bring out the deep citrus and smooth malt flavors.															

Appearance
																Cloudy, pale color with a creamy white head.															

Aroma
																Pronounced grapefruit, citrus and fruity hop aroma.															

Taste
																Assertive, clean bitter flavor with strong citrus and fruity hop taste balanced by smooth malts.															

Mouthfeel
																Medium body.															

Finish
																Lingering bitter finish with bold citrus and fruity hop notes.															




Food Pairing

	Pairs well with bold, flavorful seafood dishes, spicy Mexican food, and strong cheeses such as sharp cheddar and blue cheese.

All About Goose Island

Honestly, an island full of geese doesn't sound like the ideal place to knock back a few beers. But if the beers are as good as what Goose Island makes, we won't complain. Especially if the geese are friendly. Born in 1988 after a pint-filled tour across Europe, the brewery has been one of the most successful American micro-brews since its debut. As evidenced by the Goose Island IPA, the goal is to give you something you'll love while challenging your tastes at the same time.

OUR STORY




Our Story







OUR MISSION
WHY GOOSE ISLAND EXISTS
To lead in the craft of brewing by creating award-winning beers that define classic and innovative styles to capture the hearts, imaginations, and palates of beer drinkers.






OUR VALUES
WHAT GUIDES OUR DECISION MAKING
We are guided by our respect for the history and culture of beer as well as our passion for, and innovation in, brewing. We wish to enrich the cultural landscape of Chicago and support the inspirational organizations within our communities. Furthermore, Goose Island champions sustainability in our breweries (and beyond) as well as actively celebrates and engages our employees.






OUR VISION
WHERE WE WANT TO BE
In years to come, Goose Island will solidify our leadership in the craft brewing industry. This goal will be achieved through sharing our expertise in the brewing process, involving ourselves with professional brewing and trade organizations and growing the craft beer community through consumer engagement and education.








Our History



A GOOSE GOES TO EUROPE
Our famous beer began with a trip across Europe, when Goose Island founder (and unabashed beer lover) John Hall took a tour across the continent. Pint by pint, he savored the styles and selections of brews in every region, and thought to himself, “America deserves some damn fine beer like this, too.”
Craft brewing wasn’t widely known at the time, but upon return from his European sojourn, John set out to change all that. He settled down in his hometown of Chicago—a city perfect for craft beer, with rapidly evolving tastes and the largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got to brewing.
First he made some stellar beer. Then he invited his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way. The result was a new fascination with craft brewing, and beer that not only catered to people’s tastes, but challenged them as well.
That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant to keep up with demand. 1999 brought even more growth, along with an additional brewpub, and today, what was once one man’s pint-filled dream has become the Goose Island empire you know and love.




Our Brewery



OUR INNER WORKINGS
Our brewery was built in 1995 and has more than doubled in size since originally built. We bring you our tasty pints using 32 fermenters, over 15 different yeasts, state-of-the-art filters, centrifuges and a 50 barrel JV Northwest 5 vessel system that brews 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It turns out that making awesome brews is quite the science. Luckily our brewery facilities have all the equipment necessary to deliver results.
Our packaging line alone bottles 500 cases an hour, with our keg line at a rate of 50 kegs every 60 minutes. Once the beer is complete, we store it at a crisp 38 degrees until shipping. In other words, we don’t mess around when it comes to filling the Goose Island demand. We even have separate rooms to house small batch innovation programs and yeast propagation units, and our barrel-aged beers have their own dedicated stockroom AND 143,000 square foot barrel warehouse. It’s only the very best equipment for our beer—and we invite you to learn more.




Our Barrels



AGED BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE
In 1992, Goose Island gave the beer industry a new reason to belly up to the bar: bourbon-aged beer. We pioneered the process, and it begins with first-use bourbon barrels. Our brewers only choose those that have had held sweet, sweet whiskey in their bellies for an average of 8 years, then they age our beer inside for 8-12 months. This process takes place in a non-climate controlled space, allowing exposure to the extreme heat and cold of Chicago’s ecosystem, which contracts and expands the wood, pulling the barrel’s whiskey character into our brew. Each barrel is used only once, ensuring the best quality taste in every pint.
That first barrel-aging process yielded our ever-tasty Bourbon County Stout back in 2004. Three years later, we decided it was time to expand our barrel-aging program again. But this time our brewers brought wine barrels into the picture.
They started with beer that had undergone primary fermentation in stainless steel casks, then transferred it to wine barrels, soaked with flavor. Next came fresh fruit and wild yeasts, and the beginning of a secondary fermentation inside the barrel. Aging went on for 9-18 months, creating beer with unprecedented depth of character, increased acidity and a light essence of fruit without too much sweetness. The variety of wine barrels we use now yield some of our most unique brews, including Sofie, Juliet, Lolita, Madame Rose, Gillian and Halia.




Our Hops



Tucked away in a secluded valley in Northern Idaho is Elk Mountain Farms – the place where Goose Island hops are grown and harvested. Head Farmer Ed Atkins shares the same passion and commitment to great beer as our brewers, and together they’ve worked to grow the farm from a 70-acre operation to a 1700-acre hop heaven. Here, over 50 different types of hops, including Goose Island favorites like Saaz, Amarillo and Cascade are cultivated along with numerous experimental varieties that could one day push the boundaries of beer for drinkers and brewers alike. Elk Mountain is more than just soil and plant life; it’s a laboratory, a studio, a blank canvas on which to paint the future of Goose Island beer. Watch the video above to get a taste of this magical place or click here for a chance to experience it.




Our People








John Hall
Founder
After traveling extensively in his career in the packaging industry, John Hall was always amazed at how few beer choices Americans had. "When I traveled in Europe, everywhere I went there would always be a local beer… but not in the U.S."
Then, in 1986, fate struck John Hall in the form of a thunderstorm in Dallas, Texas. His flight delayed by the inclement weather, Hall flipped through an in-flight magazine to pass the time.
There he found his future in the form of an article on boutique beers. "I must be the only person in history who made a major career decision on the basis of a Delta Sky article," Hall chuckles.
Fascinated by what he’d read, Hall began to toy with the idea of starting a brewery. "I just loved the idea," John remembers. "I mean, what could be better than making a product that I was passionate about, and nearly every American adult liked?" After two years of thinking, researching, and planning, Hall scrapped his 20-year career with Container Corporation and opened the original Goose Island Brewpub at 1800 North Clybourn Avenue, introducing the city of Chicago to distinctive craft beer.
Goose Island Beer Co. is now one of the largest craft breweries in the Midwest. The company distributes its beers to all 50 states and the United Kingdom. "I'm working with people I love, and I love what I do," says Hall. "I'm a lucky man."
John resides in Chicago with his wife, Patricia.









Ken Stout
President & General Manager 
Ken Stout is the President & General Manager of the Goose Island Beer Company in Chicago, where he leads the brewery’s operational, sales and marketing initiatives. A Chicago native and long-time beer professional, Ken previously held the Director of Consumer Experience position at Goose Island, leading experiential marketing, as well as training & development efforts.
 Prior to his joining Goose Island in 2009, he worked for SBI-Heineken USA as the business development director, managing the 19 state central region. As a certified cicerone and Master Brewers Association Beer Steward, his passion for beer is palpable. Ken holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from DePaul University and resides in Lisle with his wife and three children.









Jared Jankoski
Brewmaster
Goose Island's Brewmaster, Jared Jankoski is responsible for creative and technical development of Goose Island's award-winning portfolio of beers.
Goose Island's Head Brewer since June of 2012, Jankoski was promoted to Brewmaster in March of 2015. Goose Island's fourth Brewmaster, Jankoski is poised to continue the company's growth as it sets the stage for the future. "Being brewmaster is about a commitment to quality from raw material to packaged beer, scrutinizing every process in between to always try to improve," says Jankoski. "We are our own toughest critics in an effort to put out the best beer we can."
"Our priority remains evolving our foundation to facilitate innovation technically, create new beers that intrigue and are enjoyable, and make this a great place to work by putting people first and having fun. We do make beer after all."
Prior to Goose Island, the Wisconsin native worked at New Glarus Brewing from 2005-2012. During that time, constant expansion and upgrading gave a valuable foundation in process flow, efficiency and quality.
Jankoski realized his passion for the sciences early on, which was cemented during a high school chemistry class and he credits the teacher for bringing out everyone’s best strengths. After doing well in the AP class, Jankoski decided chemistry would make a great focus for college and started home brewing. It was always his dream to brew for life, but at the time didn’t know if it was a viable career. Jankoski pursued his interest in chemistry and graduated with a BS from University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire in 1999. Prior to becoming a brewer professionally, he completed the American Brewer’s Guild diploma course in brewing.
With a strong belief in quality and establishing a solid foundation, Jankoski's experience at Goose Island has allowed him to focus on building a strong team and improve the foundation for making great beer to better accommodate the diverse family of brews produced in Chicago.
"I love working at Goose Island because it’s a very team oriented, inclusive place to work. Giving many different people the chance to contribute is one of the things has gone into the creation of some of our best beers and adds fulfillment and meaning to people’s work here. It just makes our work more fun."









Mike Siegel
Brewery Innovations Manager
Mike's passion for great beer started in his early 20s and soon led to many years of homebrewing and traveling the U.S. and Europe in pursuit of it. After careers in sound engineering and information technology, he was urged by his wife Katie to quit beating around the bush and make the switch to brewing professionally. Mike started at Goose Island in 2011 as a brewer and cellarman, and in 2013 was promoted to Innovation Manager. In this role, he oversees all new beer development and helps facilitate the collective creative output of the numerous talented brewers that Goose Island has on its team.









Keith Gabbett
Senior Brewer
Keith discovered craft beer in college (one of his first was Redhook Double Black Stout) and was a home brewer long before before brewing professionally. The decision to become a brewer professionally came when he decided to go to Siebel Institute rather than putting a down payment on a house. Luckily, for Keith, he had a very understanding and encouraging girlfriend (now wife) who had just finished going to culinary school. Upon graduation from Siebel, Keith went on to brew for Destihl from from 2007-2008 and joined Goose Island in 2009. Favorite beer styles: all of them, but his go to beer is an IPA or a good craft Pils. He also really like bourbon and cocktails. Oh yeah, and food is awesome too. 









Patrick Reisch
Head Cellarman
Lead Cellarman at Goose Island Beer Co. in Chicago, IL, Patrick, a 6th generation brewer, is responsible for the fermentation and finishing of Goose Island beer. Patrick began as a brewer at Goose Island in 2009 following his graduation from University of Missouri with a degree in Chemical Engineering. He spent his college summers brewing at Springfield Brewing Co. in Springfield, MO and Bridgeport Brewing Co. in Portland, OR, and homebrewed on his apartment rooftop during the year. In 2011, Patrick was one of 75 Americans awarded a government sponsored fellowship, which brought him to Germany for a year to learn German brewing techniques. While living in Munich, Patrick brewed at the Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr brewpubs, and lived and worked in the Spaten-Franziskaner brewery, gaining a deeper understanding of traditional brewing methods and furthering his love of German style hefeweizens.









Bill Savage
Lead Brewer - Barrel Program
Chicago area native, Bill is in charge of the indoor urban forest that is Goose Island's barrel program. He maintains the brewery’s spirit and funk, by handling all beers that mature in wooden vessels.
An avid home brewer in college, Bill also studied Ancient Greek and Latin languages, literature and history at Loyola University Chicago. His philosophy towards brewing beers is "old school."
Professionally, he started out working as a winemaker, and also delved into mead-making (honey wine). Following his apprenticeship and pursuits in winemaking and oak maturation, he went through brewing school at the Siebel Institute of Technology in 2012. After his brewing education, he became a brewer for Flossmoor Station Brewing Co. - learning traditional English style brewing techniques, acquainting himself with barrel aging beers, and testing out interpretations of historic brewing recipes.
 Bill has been with Goose Island since 2013, having held positions in cellar and Brewhouse, before taking over as Barrel-Lead.

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on July 1, 2008,[6][7] with the merger of Redhook Ale Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewery. CBA acquired Kona Brewing Company on October 1, 2010. In 2012, CBA launched a new brand called "Omission" beer, promoting the beer as specially crafted to remove gluten. In 2013, CBA launched a cider - Square Mile Cider, and in 2014 entered into a partnership with The Chive to create KCCO beer under the independent/Chive-owned Resignation Brewery moniker.[8]
The company was originally named Craft Brewers Alliance, but changed its name to Craft Brew Alliance on January 12, 2012.[9]
As of March 15, 2012, Craft Brew Alliance is publicly traded as NASDAQ: BREW. Prior to this date it was publicly traded as HOOK.[10]
Products[edit]
The company produces brands such as Redhook, Widmer Brothers Brewing, Omission Beer and several others.[11]

On November 21, 2013, the company announced that, effective January 1, 2014, Andy Thomas will take over as the company’s new CEO.[13]
On May 20, 2015, CBA announced the appointment of Joe Vandersteldt to CFO, along with several other changes at the executive leadership level.[14][15]
Redhook[edit]
Redhook was founded in the early 1980s in Seattle. At first, the brewery was a small shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard. The beers brewed by Redhook include ESB, IPA, Pilsner, Copperhook, and seasonal brews.[11]
Widmer Brothers Brewing[edit]
Widmer Brothers brews various beers including Drifter Pale Ale, Nelson Imperial IPA, Rotator IPA Series, Drop Top Amber Ale, Pitch Black IPA, and Upheaval IPA.
Kona Brewing Company[edit]
The Kona Brewing Company was founded in the spring of 1994 and is Hawaii's largest brewery.[11]
Omission Beer[edit]
The company's Omission beer is designed to have low gluten content by using a proprietary enzyme to remove gluten from traditional beer ingredients - namely malted barley.[16]
Square Mile Cider Company[edit]
Launched in 2013, there are two primary products under this brand - "The Original" which is a traditional hard apple cider; and "Spur & Vine", which is a "hopped apple cider".
Appalachian Mountain Brewery[edit]
On December 2, 2014, CBA entered into a strategic partnership agreement with Boone, NC-based Appalachian Mountain Brewery (AMB).[17] As part of the partnership, CBA will act as "master distributor" for AMB, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network. CBA has taken an undisclosed, minority stake in AMB.
Cisco Brewers, Inc.[edit]
On September 25, 2015, CBA announced a strategic partnership agreement with Nantucket-based Cisco Brewers.[18] As with previous partner, AMB, CBA will act as "master distributor" for AMB, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network. CBA has taken an undisclosed, minority stake in Cisco Brewers.
Wynwood Brewing[edit]
On December 15, 2016, CBA announced a strategic partnership agreement with Miami, FL-based Wynwood Brewing.[19] CBA is taking a 24.5% stake in Wynwood, valuing the deal at under $30 Million. As with previous partners, AMB and Cisco Brewers, CBA will act as "master distributor" for Wynwood, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network.
Use of the term "craft brew"[edit]
While the company name contains the phrase "craft brew", it does not meet the definition of a craft brewer according to the Brewers Association,[20] due to the percentage stake owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev.[3][21][22][23] The Brewers Association defines American craft brewers as "small, independent and traditional", with 'small' defined as an "annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less", a limit changed in 2011 from 2 million to 6 million to ensure the ongoing inclusion of Boston Beer Company[24] (the producer of the Samuel Adams brand), 'independent' defined as at least 75% owned or controlled by a craft brewer, and 'traditional' defined as at least 50% of its volume being all malt beer.[20][23]

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on July 1, 2008,[6][7] with the merger of Redhook Ale Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewery. CBA acquired Kona Brewing Company on October 1, 2010. In 2012, CBA launched a new brand called "Omission" beer, promoting the beer as specially crafted to remove gluten. In 2013, CBA launched a cider - Square Mile Cider, and in 2014 entered into a partnership with The Chive to create KCCO beer under the independent/Chive-owned Resignation Brewery moniker.[8]
The company was originally named Craft Brewers Alliance, but changed its name to Craft Brew Alliance on January 12, 2012.[9]
As of March 15, 2012, Craft Brew Alliance is publicly traded as NASDAQ: BREW. Prior to this date it was publicly traded as HOOK.[10]
Products[edit]
The company produces brands such as Redhook, Widmer Brothers Brewing, Omission Beer and several others.[11]

On November 21, 2013, the company announced that, effective January 1, 2014, Andy Thomas will take over as the company’s new CEO.[13]
On May 20, 2015, CBA announced the appointment of Joe Vandersteldt to CFO, along with several other changes at the executive leadership level.[14][15]
Redhook[edit]
Redhook was founded in the early 1980s in Seattle. At first, the brewery was a small shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard. The beers brewed by Redhook include ESB, IPA, Pilsner, Copperhook, and seasonal brews.[11]
Widmer Brothers Brewing[edit]
Widmer Brothers brews various beers including Drifter Pale Ale, Nelson Imperial IPA, Rotator IPA Series, Drop Top Amber Ale, Pitch Black IPA, and Upheaval IPA.
Kona Brewing Company[edit]
The Kona Brewing Company was founded in the spring of 1994 and is Hawaii's largest brewery.[11]
Omission Beer[edit]
The company's Omission beer is designed to have low gluten content by using a proprietary enzyme to remove gluten from traditional beer ingredients - namely malted barley.[16]
Square Mile Cider Company[edit]
Launched in 2013, there are two primary products under this brand - "The Original" which is a traditional hard apple cider; and "Spur & Vine", which is a "hopped apple cider".
Appalachian Mountain Brewery[edit]
On December 2, 2014, CBA entered into a strategic partnership agreement with Boone, NC-based Appalachian Mountain Brewery (AMB).[17] As part of the partnership, CBA will act as "master distributor" for AMB, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network. CBA has taken an undisclosed, minority stake in AMB.
Cisco Brewers, Inc.[edit]
On September 25, 2015, CBA announced a strategic partnership agreement with Nantucket-based Cisco Brewers.[18] As with previous partner, AMB, CBA will act as "master distributor" for AMB, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network. CBA has taken an undisclosed, minority stake in Cisco Brewers.
Wynwood Brewing[edit]
On December 15, 2016, CBA announced a strategic partnership agreement with Miami, FL-based Wynwood Brewing.[19] CBA is taking a 24.5% stake in Wynwood, valuing the deal at under $30 Million. As with previous partners, AMB and Cisco Brewers, CBA will act as "master distributor" for Wynwood, allowing their products to ship via the Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor network.
Use of the term "craft brew"[edit]
While the company name contains the phrase "craft brew", it does not meet the definition of a craft brewer according to the Brewers Association,[20] due to the percentage stake owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev.[3][21][22][23] The Brewers Association defines American craft brewers as "small, independent and traditional", with 'small' defined as an "annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less", a limit changed in 2011 from 2 million to 6 million to ensure the ongoing inclusion of Boston Beer Company[24] (the producer of the Samuel Adams brand), 'independent' defined as at least 75% owned or controlled by a craft brewer, and 'traditional' defined as at least 50% of its volume being all malt beer.[20][23]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
