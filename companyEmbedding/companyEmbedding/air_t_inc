Member Stories






MATTHEW ANDERSONMatthew Anderson, 16, played tight end and safety at Warren East High School. One night, he went up to catch a pass while being double covered, and the safety hit Matthew in the spine.
Matthew walked off the field, but collapsed after crossing the sideline. He couldn’t feel his arm or leg on the right side.
Read More 
AirMedCare Network arrived and flight nurse, Tara McIntire had a big job on her hands: keeping both Matthew and his parents calm.
“It’s hard when you take someone’s baby away from them and they don’t get to go,” McIntire said.
Matthew luckily was okay—while he did suffer a lower back injury, he was able to return to football for the playoffs.
 



BOBBIE GARCIAOne day last March, Bobbie Garcia woke up and couldn’t breathe. Suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), she had a sudden viral infection and was struggling more than normal to breathe.
With little cell phone reception, she wasn’t able to get through to 911.
Read More 
Luckily, a friend that lived near by was able to transport her to the hospital. Once there, they determined based on her medical history that she would do better at the Methodist Texan Hospital in San Antonio, as they had greater abilities to care for the problems she was facing.
Bobbi says of the flight crew, “I couldn’t have been treated any better. They were really wonderful.”
Bobbie is now back home and doing much better. To the crew that helped her through her fateful flight, she sends her heartfelt thank you.

FAQs






What is included in my membership?

Members are entitled to transport (when available) by an AirMedCare Network provider to the closest appropriate medical facility for medical conditions deemed by an attending medical professional to be life- or limb-threatening, or that could lead to permanent disability. Members also receive a welcome packet complete with auto stickers and membership cards. Members have the peace of mind knowing that they will receive no out-of-pocket expense for their flights.




What is the benefit of membership to you?

Although you do not have to be a member to be transported, membership offers several important benefits:
First, as one of more than 2.6 million members, AirMedCare Network Providers will work on your behalf with your benefits provider to secure payment for your flight, with any uncovered amounts considered to be fully prepaid. As such, members who are transported by AirMedCare Network will not receive a bill for the flight. Importantly, your membership is valid in all of our service areas so you are covered while traveling in those areas. If they determine air medical transport is needed, and they dispatch one of our ambulance providers, your membership will provide coverage.
In addition, becoming an AirMedCare Network member is a good way to support the health care needs of your local community. Our membership base – the largest of its kind in the United States – helps us operate in rural areas where having a quick response time to critical medical situations can save lives.




How can a membership be so inexpensive and yet still be able to cover the cost of a flight?

Membership fees alone are not enough to cover the cost of member transports. Those fees are prepaid protection against costs not covered by a member’s insurance, other benefits or third party responsibility. Almost all of our members have some type of insurance, benefit or third party responsibility that covers all or part of the cost of transport. Collecting enough from those sources is necessary to keep membership fees low. Of course, if there is no other source of payment for a member’s transport, the transport is still covered in full by the membership.

Member Stories






MATTHEW ANDERSONMatthew Anderson, 16, played tight end and safety at Warren East High School. One night, he went up to catch a pass while being double covered, and the safety hit Matthew in the spine.
Matthew walked off the field, but collapsed after crossing the sideline. He couldn’t feel his arm or leg on the right side.
Read More 
AirMedCare Network arrived and flight nurse, Tara McIntire had a big job on her hands: keeping both Matthew and his parents calm.
“It’s hard when you take someone’s baby away from them and they don’t get to go,” McIntire said.
Matthew luckily was okay—while he did suffer a lower back injury, he was able to return to football for the playoffs.
 



BOBBIE GARCIAOne day last March, Bobbie Garcia woke up and couldn’t breathe. Suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), she had a sudden viral infection and was struggling more than normal to breathe.
With little cell phone reception, she wasn’t able to get through to 911.
Read More 
Luckily, a friend that lived near by was able to transport her to the hospital. Once there, they determined based on her medical history that she would do better at the Methodist Texan Hospital in San Antonio, as they had greater abilities to care for the problems she was facing.
Bobbi says of the flight crew, “I couldn’t have been treated any better. They were really wonderful.”
Bobbie is now back home and doing much better. To the crew that helped her through her fateful flight, she sends her heartfelt thank you.

FAQs






What is included in my membership?

Members are entitled to transport (when available) by an AirMedCare Network provider to the closest appropriate medical facility for medical conditions deemed by an attending medical professional to be life- or limb-threatening, or that could lead to permanent disability. Members also receive a welcome packet complete with auto stickers and membership cards. Members have the peace of mind knowing that they will receive no out-of-pocket expense for their flights.




What is the benefit of membership to you?

Although you do not have to be a member to be transported, membership offers several important benefits:
First, as one of more than 2.6 million members, AirMedCare Network Providers will work on your behalf with your benefits provider to secure payment for your flight, with any uncovered amounts considered to be fully prepaid. As such, members who are transported by AirMedCare Network will not receive a bill for the flight. Importantly, your membership is valid in all of our service areas so you are covered while traveling in those areas. If they determine air medical transport is needed, and they dispatch one of our ambulance providers, your membership will provide coverage.
In addition, becoming an AirMedCare Network member is a good way to support the health care needs of your local community. Our membership base – the largest of its kind in the United States – helps us operate in rural areas where having a quick response time to critical medical situations can save lives.




How can a membership be so inexpensive and yet still be able to cover the cost of a flight?

Membership fees alone are not enough to cover the cost of member transports. Those fees are prepaid protection against costs not covered by a member’s insurance, other benefits or third party responsibility. Almost all of our members have some type of insurance, benefit or third party responsibility that covers all or part of the cost of transport. Collecting enough from those sources is necessary to keep membership fees low. Of course, if there is no other source of payment for a member’s transport, the transport is still covered in full by the membership.

Collecting enough from those sources is necessary to keep membership fees low. Of course, if there is no other source of payment for a member’s transport, the transport is still covered in full by the membership.

Engineered Air Nozzles and Jets reduce noise levels and air costs."Go Green" by upgrading your blowoff, cooling and drying operation to the award winning Super Air Nozzles!What Are Air Nozzles and Jets?
A simple solution to reduce excessive air consumption and noise level on compressed air blowoff operations. EXAIR Air Nozzles and Jets produce outlet flows up to 25 times compressed air consumption using a small amount of compressed air as the power source.
Why Air Nozzles and Jets?Air savings, compared to open copper tubes or pipe nipples commonly used for blowoff can be as high as 80%. Less compressed air means less noise. The typical noise level reduction is 10 dBA. All Air Nozzles and Jets meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) maximum dead end pressure requirements.





An open 1/4" (6mm) copper tube, by contrast, ejects pure compressed air at up to 40 SCFM (1,133 SLPM), the entire output of a 10 horsepower compressor. Annual energy cost can exceed $1,000 per year. Noise levels in excess of 100 dBA are commonly produced. When supply pressure exceeds 30 PSIG (2 BAR), an open pipe, tube or drilled holes violates OSHA static pressure requirements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
