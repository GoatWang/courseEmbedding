BFK Capital Corp. and the Hydropothecary Corporation Announce Proposed Qualifying Transaction
TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / November 17, 2016 / BFK Capital Corp. (TSXV: BFK.P) (“BFK“), a Capital Pool Company, and The Hydropothecary Corporation (“THC“) are pleased to announce that they have entered into a non-binding letter of intent to complete a business combination (the “Transaction“). The letter of intent was negotiated at arm’s length and is effective as of November 16, 2016.
Information Concerning BFK
BFK is a company existing under the laws of Ontario, a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, and a Capital Pool Company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange“). BFK has not commenced commercial operations and has no assets other than cash. If completed, the Transaction will constitute BFK’s Qualifying Transaction pursuant to the policies of the Exchange.
BFK currently has 2,756,665 common shares (“BFK Shares“) issued and outstanding, of which 1,676,665 BFK Shares are currently held in escrow pursuant to the policies of the Exchange. In addition, BFK has outstanding stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 266,665 BFK Shares at a price of $0.60 per share (the “BFK Options“) to directors and officers. Other than these BFK Shares and BFK Options, no other securities of BFK are outstanding.
Further information concerning BFK can be found in the prospectus of BFK dated October 23, 2014, which is available under BFK’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Information Concerning THC
THC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 167151 Canada Inc. (“167151“), is licensed under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations to cultivate and sell marijuana seeds and plants and dried marijuana product and to produce marijuana oils, marijuana resins and fresh marijuana products. THC’s facilities are located in Gatineau, Québec.
THC is a private company existing under the laws of Canada which was incorporated on August 13, 2013. THC currently has 7,346,637 common shares (“THC Shares“) issued and outstanding. In addition, THC has issued and outstanding: (i) stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 835,649 THC Shares at exercise prices ranging between $1.00 and $4.50 per share (the “THCOptions“); (ii) common share purchase warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,850,905 THC Shares at exercise prices ranging between $4.00 and $6.23 per share (based on current exchange rates for certain warrants exercisable at US$4.60 per share) (the “THC Warrants“); (iii) $345,000 principal amount of unsecured convertible debentures (the “THC Unsecured Debentures“), the principal amount of which is convertible into units of THC at a price of $4.50 per unit, each unit consisting of one THC Share and one common share purchase warrant exercisable to acquire one THC Share at an exercise price of $5.00 per share for a period of two years from the date of issuance; (iv) US$3,275,000 principal amount of secured convertible debentures (the “THC Secured Debentures“), the principal amount of which is convertible into THC Shares at a price of US$4.20 per share. Other than these THC Shares, THC Options, THC Warrants, THC Unsecured Debentures and THC Secured Debentures, no other securities of THC are issued and outstanding.
The THC Shares are widely held and the only shareholders of THC who directly or indirectly own more than 5% of the issued and outstanding THC Shares are Sebastien St-Louis (resident in Ottawa, Ontario), Louis Gagnon (resident in Gatineau, Québec), Adam Miron (resident in Ottawa, Ontario), Dr. Michael Munzar (resident in Montreal Quebec) and Casale HC Limited Partnership (a private investment partnership formed under the laws of Québec), who directly or indirectly hold approximately 9.9%, 8.9%, 8.4%, 5.2% and 7.0% of the outstanding THC Shares, respectively. The remaining THC Shares are held by approximately 152 shareholders.
Information Concerning the Proposed Transaction
BFK and THC have entered into the letter of intent setting out certain terms and conditions pursuant to which the proposed Transaction will be completed. The transaction terms set out in the letter of intent are non-binding, and the Transaction is subject to the parties successfully negotiating and entering into a definitive business combination agreement in respect of the Transaction (the “Definitive Agreement“) on or before December 9, 2016 or such other date as BFK and THC may agree.
It is anticipated that the completion of the Transaction will involve the following steps:

subject to shareholder approval, BFK will consolidate the outstanding BFK Shares on a 1.5 to 1 basis (the “Consolidation“), so that following the Consolidation, BFK will have 1,837,777 BFK Shares issued and outstanding, as well as the BFK Options which will then be exercisable to acquire 177,777 BFK Shares at a price of $0.90 per share;
BFK will then issue BFK Shares to the holders of the THC Shares in exchange for the THC Shares on the basis of six (6) post-Consolidation BFK Shares for each THC Share held (the “Exchange Ratio“), resulting in the issuance of 44,079,822 post-Consolidation BFK Shares to THC’s current shareholders;
the holders of the THC Options will receive replacement stock options of BFK in exchange for the THC Options on the basis of the Exchange Ratio, resulting in the issuance of BFK stock options exercisable to acquire 5,013,894 post-Consolidation BFK Shares at exercise prices ranging between $0.17 and $0.75 per share;
the holders of the THC Warrants will receive replacement common share purchase warrants of BFK in exchange for the THC Warrants on the basis of the Exchange Ratio, resulting in the issuance of BFK warrants exercisable to acquire 11,104,830 post-Consolidation BFK Shares at exercise prices ranging between $0.67 and $1.04 per share;
the holders of the THC Unsecured Debentures will receive replacement unsecured debentures of BFK, the principal amount of which will be convertible into units of BFK at a price of $0.75 per unit, each unit consisting of one post-Consolidation BFK Share and one common share purchase warrant exercisable to acquire one post-Consolidation BFK Share at an exercise price of $0.83 per share;
the holders of the THC Secured Debentures will receive replacement secured debentures of BFK, the principal amount of which will be convertible into post-Consolidation BFK Shares at a price of US$0.77 per share; and
BFK will change its name to “The Hydropothecary Corporation” or such other similar name as the parties may agree to.

It is expected that the share exchange will be structured as a three-cornered amalgamation in which THC will amalgamate with a newly incorporated, wholly-owned subsidiary of BFK to be formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the Transaction. Following the amalgamation, the amalgamated company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFK (renamed as the parties may agree to) and 167151 will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the amalgamated company. The final legal structure for the Transaction, however, will be determined after the parties have considered all applicable tax, securities law, and accounting efficiencies.
As a result of the amalgamation, the current holders of THC Shares (not including future shareholders as a result of the Financing referred to below) will hold approximately 96% of the post-Consolidation BFK Shares and the current holders of the BFK Shares will hold approximately 4% of the post-Consolidation BFK Shares.
The Transaction will not constitute a Non-Arm’s Length Transaction (as such term is defined in the policies of the Exchange). No Insider, promoter or Control Person (as such terms are defined in the policies of the Exchange) of BFK has any material interest in THC prior to giving effect to the Transaction, except that Greg Misztela, a director of BFK, holds or has a beneficial interest in, directly or through affiliates or associates, 104,810 THC Shares, representing approximately 1.43% of the issued and outstanding THC Shares. These shares were acquired in private placements completed prior to the date of this release.
The BFK securities issuable under the Transaction will be subject to the escrow requirements of the Exchange and hold periods as required by applicable securities laws.
The Transaction is not subject to approval by the shareholders of BFK. However, at a meeting of the shareholders of BFK to be called in connection with the Transaction, the shareholders of BFK will be asked to approve the Consolidation and, to the extent necessary, approve the appointment of new directors as detailed below. The Transaction is subject to approval by the shareholders of THC, which will be sought at a meeting of the shareholders of THC to be held as soon as practicable.
Financing
Prior to completion of the Transaction, THC intends to complete a brokered private placement of up to 2,900,000 THC Shares at a price of $4.50 per share for gross proceeds of up to $13.05 million (the “Financing“). THC has engaged Canaccord Genuity Corp. to act as agent in respect of the Financing.
Under the Transaction, the THC shareholders resulting from the Financing will receive post-Consolidation BFK Shares in exchange for their THC Shares on the basis of the Exchange Ratio. It is a condition to closing of the Transaction that THC completes the Financing for gross proceeds of at least $10 million.
Management and Board of Directors of Resulting Issuer

Results of the lots now released for sale show no sign of contamination. Health Canada has been provided with these test results. The Company will continue to test product using its previously implemented voluntary testing program and is supportive of Health Canada's mandatory testing initiative announced on May 5, 2017. The Company will continue to keep patients informed and updated on test results. With the resumed selling, the Company currently has 13 of 14 products available for sale. Registered clients can order their products as normal, through the webstore or by calling the Company's 24/7 line at 1-844-406-1852. Those wishing to register can do so online or by calling the Company."Hydropothecary has always put our customers' health and safety first, through providing well grown and rigorously tested medical cannabis of the highest quality. Today's announcement that we have lifted the voluntary stop-sale is a direct result of our quality assurance efforts. We will continue to strive for the highest possible standards for all of our products and to put patients first," said Sebastien St-Louis, Co-founder and CEO.Based on the completion of other, additional screening, the Company is currently voluntarily recalling fourteen lots of medical cannabis, which were supplied between February 1, 2016 and May 1, 2017, due to the detection of myclobutanil. These products have tested positive for trace amounts over 0.01 parts per million, but no more than 0.08 parts per million. The recalled lots are lots numbered 45, 46, 47, 54, 58, 59, 102, 109, 123, 127, 128, 129, 148 and 150.Health Canada has deemed this a Type III recall, defined as "a situation in which the use of, or exposure to a product is not likely to cause any adverse health consequences." All affected clients are being notified.The source of the contamination is unknown at this time, however the Company is carrying out an in-depth investigation and has completed sampling across its facility. A total of 254 samples have been sent for independent testing, including live plants (flowering, vegetating, mothers), previously-tested dried cannabis lots, production inputs, cultivation equipment, and grow area wall scrapings. Initial results indicate the contamination occurred during older production, but has not exceeded 0.08 parts per million.In addition, the Company is conducting additional screening on all lots produced since Hydropothecary's inception, as part of its commitment to the highest health and safety standards."We will remain resolute in ensuring that our clients have the utmost confidence in all Hydropothecary products and will keep everyone informed of our findings through our daily updates" Mr. St-Louis said.About The Hydropothecary CorporationThe Hydropothecary Corporation is an authorized licensed producer and distributor of medical marijuana licensed by Health Canada under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (Canada).

The Hydropothecary Corporation announced today that it is recalling fourteen products due to detection of myclobutanil, an unauthorized pesticide product. The company has also resumed selling cannabis products from certain lots after completion of additional testing following the Company's previously announced voluntary stop-sale on its products.
The Quebec company says lot retesting was carried out to ensure there was no presence of myclobutanil, a pesticide approved for use in agriculture (e.g. apples trees, almonds, strawberries, vegetables, soybeans and grape vines), but not for use on cannabis. Results of the lots now released for sale show no sign of contamination. Health Canada has been provided with these test results.
The fourteen recalled lots, however, tested positive for trace amounts over 0.01 parts per million (ppm), but no more than 0.08 parts per million. Health Canada has recently announced that they will be requiring pesticide testing for all cannabis producers, reportedly to levels of .01 ppm. As myclobutanil is an unauthorized pesticide, there are no known acceptable limits on cannabis in Canada. A limit of .01 ppm is based on current accuracy of available technology. You can find past updates on cannabis recalls here.
Hydropothecary says they will continue to test product using thier previously implemented voluntary testing program, and they are supportive of Health Canada's mandatory testing initiative announced on May 5, 2017. With the resumed selling, the company currently has 13 of 14 products available for sale.
"Hydropothecary has always put our customers' health and safety first, through providing well grown and rigorously tested medical cannabis of the highest quality. Today's announcement that we have lifted the voluntary stop-sale is a direct result of our quality assurance efforts. We will continue to strive for the highest possible standards for all of our products and to put patients first," said Sebastien St-Louis, co-founder and CEO, in a company press release.

The recalled lots are lots numbered 45, 46, 47, 54, 58, 59, 102, 109, 123, 127, 128, 129, 148 and 150.

"We got it but we don't know where it came from"  is not an acceptable answer when it comes to medical cannabis. I know exactly what's being used in my garden and that includes zero pesticides. I am quite happy NOT to be buying any Legal Provider product. You never find out that it was bad bud until after you've smoked it. And replacing the pot does not seem anything like adequate compensation to me.

New measures put in place by Health Canada to screen medical marijuana companies for contaminants have turned up further problems in the industry, with the discovery of a banned pesticide at Hydropothecary Corp.The company, one of more than three dozen federally licensed cannabis producers, was told by Health Canada on Monday that leaf samples taken during an inspection of its Gatineau facility contained myclobutanil. The chemical, which is used to kill mildew, is a known carcinogen that is strictly prohibited for use on plants that are smoked because it produces hydrogen cyanide when heated.

“Earlier this year, Health Canada announced it would begin conducting random testing of medical cannabis products for the use of unauthorized pest control products to provide added assurance to Canadians that they are receiving safe, quality-controlled product,” Health Canada said in a statement Tuesday.Globe Investigation: What’s in your weed? We tested dispensary marijuana to find out“The first results of this random testing were received yesterday and have identified low levels of myclobutanil, a pesticide that is not authorized for use on cannabis.”Hydropothecary has halted all sales and shipments to customers while it investigates the problem. The company told The Globe and Mail it will be screening all of its products for safety in the coming days and making those results public on its website.“This is an evolving matter and we are working closely with Health Canada to determine the next steps,” said Shane Morris, Hydropothecary’s vice-president of quality assurance and scientific affairs.Mr. Morris said the problem was discovered in trimmings taken from some of the company’s mother plants – which are used to produce offspring plants that are harvested. Hydropothecary is now testing its offspring plants to see if they also contain the chemical. Mr. Morris said the company does not know how the banned pesticide got into the plants in question, and that will also be a subject of the investigation.Though harmful chemicals are a known problem in the black market, this is the fourth time in less than six months that the government-regulated sector has been hit with a tainted cannabis problem. Mettrum Ltd., Organigram Inc. and Aurora Cannabis Inc. each announced recalls in December because of chemicals such as myclobutanil and bifenazate, an insecticide. Both can lead to serious health problems if inhaled directly into the lungs.The discovery of myclobutanil at Hydropothecary indicates heightened scrutiny by Health Canada, though, since the regulator had previously not been testing companies for banned chemicals and had essentially left the industry to police itself.But after the recalls, Health Canada announced in February it would begin randomly testing producers. The department has so far conducted seven unannounced inspections of licensed producers, Health Canada said, and these results are the first of that effort.The amounts of myclobutanil evident in the Hydropothecary tests are smaller than the problems that triggered the Organigram, Mettrum and Aurora recalls, which involved myclobutanil levels of up to 20 parts per million (ppm).According to Hydropothecary, Health Canada’s tests found levels of myclobutanil of 0.023 ppm and 0.012 ppm.Mr. Morris said Hydropothecary had been proactively screening its products for pesticides down to a level of 0.05 ppm, which was a policy it introduced a few months ago after the industry met with Health Canada, and had found no problems. However, Health Canada’s test results show the regulator is testing for even smaller amounts of banned chemicals than companies are, indicating the government is clamping down.It is unclear whether Hydropothecary will issue a product recall in the days ahead. Mr. Morris said that determination has not been made.When the three recalls came to light in December, Health Canada and some of the companies involved said the levels found (of up to 20 ppm of myclobutanil) were “trace” amounts and that consumers were at low risk for health problems.But a top U.S. toxicologist disputes that assessment, noting that “trace amount” isn’t a scientific term, and is often used subjectively to play down any problems. Minute levels of chemicals can have dangerous effects on the body, said Dr. Warren Porter, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Another expert told The Globe that levels above 1 ppm are not considered trace amounts.Because myclobutanil is approved for use on some food crops, such as grapes, the medical marijuana companies involved in the recalls have told consumers it is not harmful. Toxicologists say those statements are misleading, since pesticides are designed to be metabolized by the digestive system. When smoked, they enter the bloodstream directly through the lungs without being broken down.In fact, the effects of inhaling myclobutanil through smoking have never been studied and its manufacturer, Dow AgroSciences, said in January it has no intention to seek such approval for the product.Hundreds of patients exposed to myclobutanil and bifenazate through the recalls announced in December have come forward complaining of serious health issues, ranging from breathing problems to persistent headaches and nausea, blistering rashes and muscle pain. Health Minister Jane Philpott will not comment on the matter, despite several attempts to pose questions through her spokesman.Editor's Note: Health Canada announced in February (not January) that it would begin randomly testing producers.
