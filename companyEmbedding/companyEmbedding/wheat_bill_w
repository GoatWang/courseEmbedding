Dr. William Davis | Cardiologist & Author of Wheat Belly Books































































 Check it out — Dr. Davis newest book, Undoctored: Why Healthcare Has Failed You and You Can Become Smarter Than Your Doctor, is in stores now! Click to order and learn more. Learn More


Dr. William DavisCardiologist + Author + Health Crusader "The food you eat is making you sick and the agencies that are providing you with guidelines on what to eat are giving dangerous advice with devastating health consequences.  You can change that today."


 Create a grain-free lifestyle without sacrificing nutrition, variety, or taste
The driving theme in all of cardiologist Dr. William Davis’ books is self-empowerment, providing readers with powerful tools that cut through the misinterpretations, misconceptions, misleading marketing, and bad science that passes as nutritional and health information.
Conventional nutritional advice has led the country, now the world, into record-setting epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and other “modern” health conditions. 
Dr. Davis’ powerful, contrary messages help readers avoid or even reverse many of the conditions acquired by engaging in today's nutrition mistakes.
When readers are provided the genuine science underlying the “healthy whole grain” message — not the “science” that demonstrates that whole grains are superior to white flour — it becomes clear that grains have always been a problematic calorie source, with problems amplified by changes introduced by genetics manipulations and agribusiness. 
Cutting-edge research, for example, has revealed that consumption of modern wheat is the first step in triggering autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. 
As powerful as wheat elimination — or even better, all grains — can be, there is more to address as part of an effort to establish ideal health.
Many of our discussions are therefore focused on issues such as: re-establishing healthy bowel flora and gastrointestinal health, how to manage blood sugars, and how to stack the odds in your favor of reversing autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 
The Wheat Belly books and cookbooks, Blog, and Wheat Belly Lifestyle Institute help create a grain-free lifestyle for readers and their families while not sacrificing nutrition, variety, or taste. Rich and delicious breakfasts, main meals, desserts, holidays and entertaining all easily fit into a healthy grain-free lifestyle following the Wheat Belly methods. 
Wheat-Free Market provides healthy convenient foods that fit into this lifestyle, all approved by Dr. Davis. The Cureality program provides an advanced and sophisticated collection of online tools to seize back control over health.

 The Books That Changed The Nutrition World Forever!
Grains are a mistake! Added to the human diet in desperation, they now dominate the human food experience. And grains are no longer traditional strains, but Frankengrains created by genetics research and agribusiness.
Wheat Belly challenged the notion of “healthy whole grains” and brought the food world to its knees with its provocative and revealing insights. The Wheat Belly Cookbook and 30-Minute Cookbook provide the day-to-day tools to succeed in the wheat-free lifestyle. Wheat Belly Total Health picks up where the original Wheat Belly left off, showing the reader how to reclaim health by mending all the health disruptions left by grain consumption.

Wheat









Overview

Wheat ranks third among U.S. field crops in planted acreage, production, and gross farm receipts, behind corn and soybeans. In 2016/17 U.S. farmers produced a total of .820 billion bushels of winter, other spring, and durum wheat on 50.2 million acres of cropland.
U.S. wheat planted area for 2017/18 is projected at 46 million acres, a record-low.
Declining wheat plantings and production are attributable to lower relative returns for wheat, changes in government programs that give farmers more planting flexibility, and increased competition in global wheat markets.
The U.S. share of the global wheat market has also been declining over the past two decades as the European Union and Russia have risen in prominence. Between 2001 and 2005, the U.S. share of global wheat exports averaged 25 percent; by 2016/17, the U.S. share slipped to about 15 percent.
The ERS Outputs on Wheat 
ERS provides a range of data products and reports on the wheat market, including domestic and international supply, demand, trade, and prices. 
Periodic scheduled outputs include the following:

Wheat Outlook: a monthly report that provides supply and use projections for U.S. and global wheat markets based on the most current World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates.
Wheat Yearbook Tables: a monthly data set that provides statistics on U.S. supply and use of wheat—including the five classes of wheat: (1) hard red winter, (2) hard red spring, (3) soft red winter, (4) white, and (5) durum and rye.
Feed Grains Database: a searchable database containing statistics on four feed grains (corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats), foreign coarse grains (feed grains plus rye, millet, and mixed grains), hay, and related items. Data from the Feed Outlook and Feed Yearbook are also included.
Commodity Cost and Returns : a data product that provides annual estimates of production costs and returns for major field crops, including corn.
Agricultural Baseline Database: an annual report published in February that offers 10-year projections from USDA's annual long-term projections report. The database covers projections for wheat, in addition to the other major grain crops and livestock.

In addition to the periodic Outlook reports and data products, ERS publishes reports covering issues important to wheat markets in the United States and around the world. 
Recent ERS reports, special articles, and features relating to wheat include the following:
Productivity Growth and the Revival of Russian Agriculture: Russia's agricultural total factor productivity in 1994-2013 reveals that output specialization has been a key feature of agricultural recovery in the transition to a market economy. Some districts specialized more in grains and oilseeds, others in animal products. The fastest productivity growth occurred in the South, which emerged as Russia's most important agricultural district (April 2017).
USDA Agricultural Projections to 2026: USDA's 10-year projections for the food and agriculture sector cover major agricultural commodities, agricultural trade, and aggregate indicators of the U.S. farm sector, such as farm income (February 2017).
Changing Crop Area in the Former Soviet Union: This report examines how total crop area and area for grain have changed in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. After falling substantially in all three countries during the 1990s, total area and grain area have rebounded somewhat in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, but currently, area is still far below the levels of the late Soviet period in Russia and Kazakhstan (February 2017).
Global Macroeconomic Developments Drive Downturn in U.S. Agricultural Exports: The macroeconomic outlook underlying the 2016 USDA 10-year agricultural projections indicates slower global income growth, particularly in developing countries, and a stronger dollar. This shift in the macroeconomic environment relative to the past decade implies smaller projected increases in agricultural trade and declines in U.S. market share relative to previous projections (July 2016).
Thinning Markets in U.S. Agriculture: As markets have fewer purchases, low trading volume, and low liquidity, U.S. agriculture is growing more concentrated, which raises concerns about equity for producers and efficiency in market performance (March 2016).
Deconstructing Wheat Price Spikes: A Model of Supply and Demand, Financial Speculation, and Commodity Price Co-movement: In 2008, wheat futures prices spiked and then crashed along with prices for other agricultural and nonagricultural commodities. This study uses an econometric model to explain the influence of various factors, including passive speculation by large traders, on wheat prices. Findings show that market-specific changes related to supply and demand for wheat were the dominant cause of price spikes (April 2014).
Recent Convergence Performance of Futures and Cash Prices for Corn, Soybeans, and Wheat: From 2005 to 2011, wheat, corn, and soybean futures contracts were affected by growing discrepancies between expiring futures prices and cash prices—a problem known as non-convergence. In response, the futures exchanges modified their contracts to better reflect market conditions. Those modifications appear to have improved convergence in these markets since 2011 (December 2013).
