Title: Chief Executive Officer

Job Details
               Company Size: $100 mil to less than $250 mil - Employee Range: 1,000 to less than 5,000. Bama for business: this essentially means we're a business to business company. The Bama Companies has a history full of innovation and a modern focus on continuous improvement. This means that even though we've reached the top of our industry, we still believe that we can always get better. It was instilled in us from our humble beginnings in Dallas, TX in 1927, and it followed us as we invented, created and sold America's first handheld pie in 1967. Today we work with the world's largest brands-in some cases we grow with them, and in other cases they've grown with us. We know the value in a good partnership. Are you in the food business, either as a restaurant concept or a grocery chain? We'd love for you to dig a little deeper, and learn Why Bama can bring a seasoned, driven partner to your baked goods offerings.
