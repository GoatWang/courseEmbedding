Learn about upgrading this memorial...Birth: Feb. 10,  1921JohnsonLamoille CountyVermont, USADeath: Feb. 23,  2010NewportOrleans CountyVermont, USABradley A. Thomas Jr., 89, of Newport died in Newport February 23, 2010. Mr. Thomas was born February 10, 1921, in Johnson, a son of Bradley Sr. and Marjorie (Post) Thomas. He graduated from Enosburg Falls High School in 1939.  Shortly afterward he joined the Army and served in World War II in the 643rd Tank Destroyer Battalion as a driver.  He was in the Ardennes, Rhineland, and central Europe. He married Simonne (Goulet) Whiteman on August 20, 1949.  She predeceased him in 1985. He was department head for the former A&P Grocery Store in Newport for several years. He was a member of American Legion Newport Post 21. He was fond of the Big Band sound, and that music could be heard at any time upon entering his home.  He was an avid reader and especially liked mysteries, foreign intrigue, and war stories until his failing vision forced him to discontinue that activity as well as driving and playing golf. Until his illness made it difficult, he tried to walk every day and joined the members of the Herb March coffee club at Wendy's.  He often said that the teasing and joke telling that took place at those gatherings were the highlight of the day.  His great sense of humor largely contributed to the festive mood. He is survived by his children:  Gary Thomas and his wife, Patty, of Derby, Karen Blais and Phil Sheltra of Westfield, and Brenda Giannino of San Diego, California; by his grandchildren:  Jaime (Blais) Comtois and her husband, Jon, of Newport, Anthony Blais of Troy, and Joanna Thomas and her friend, Drew Brinckerhoff, of South Burlington; by his great-grandson Ryan Blais of Troy; by his brother James R. Thomas of Burlington; and by his special friend of 23 years, Theresa Trotier.  He was predeceased by his sister Helen O'Connor. Funeral services were held February 27 at a Curtis-Britch Converse-Rushford Funeral Home in Newport with the Reverend Richard Whitehill officiating.  Interment with full military honors will take place in the summer at Pine Grove Cemetery in Newport. Should friends desire, contributions in Mr. Thomas' memory may be made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, attention voluntary services, 215 North Main Street, White River Junction, Vermont 05009. Online condolences may be sent to the family at www.curtis-britch-converse-rushford.com. Arrangements are by Curtis-Britch Converse-Rushford Funeral Homes.  Family links:  Parents:  Bradley Ambrose Thomas (1890 - 1984)  Marjorie Lorena Post Thomas (1894 - 1978)  Spouse:  Simmone P.
