Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

other instruments on behalf of such trust and sue and be
sued.

SECTION 2.2. Office . The
office of the Issuer shall be in care of the Owner Trustee at the
Corporate Trust Office or at such other address as the Owner
Trustee may designate by written notice to the Residual
Interestholder, the Seller and the Administrator.

SECTION 2.3. Purposes and
Powers . The purpose of the Issuer is, and the Issuer shall
have the power and authority, to engage in the following
activities:

(a) to issue the Notes pursuant to
the Indenture and the Certificates pursuant to this Agreement, and
to sell, transfer and exchange the Notes and the Certificates and
to pay interest on and principal of the Notes and distributions to
the Residual Interestholder;

(b) to acquire the property and
assets set forth in the Sale and Servicing Agreement from the
Seller pursuant to the terms thereof, to make deposits to and
withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Reserve Account and
to pay the organizational, start-up and transactional expenses of
the Issuer;

(c) to assign, grant, transfer,
pledge, mortgage and convey the Trust Estate pursuant to the
Indenture and to hold, manage and distribute to the Residual
Interestholder any portion of the Trust Estate released from the

Second Amended and
Restated





  


  



Trust Agreement
(2012-2)







(e) to engage in those activities,
including entering into agreements, that are necessary, suitable or
convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental thereto or
connected therewith; and

(f) subject to compliance with the
Transaction Documents, to engage in such other activities as may be
required in connection with conservation of the Trust Estate and
the making of distributions to the Residual Interestholder and the
Noteholders.

The Owner Trustee is hereby
authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf of the
Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer shall engage in any activity other than in connection with
the foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the terms
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the
Owner Trustee. The Seller hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as
trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have all
the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . As of the date of the Original
Trust Agreement, SCRF sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and set
over to DBTCD the sum of $1, which amount has heretofore been
delivered to the Owner Trustee by DBTCD. The Owner Trustee hereby
acknowledges receipt in trust from DBTCD of the foregoing
contribution, which shall constitute the initial Trust Estate and
shall be deposited in the Collection Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Residual Interestholder,
subject to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction
Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the
Issuer constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust
Statute and that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument
of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that, solely for federal income or state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes, so long as there is a
single beneficial owner of the Residual Interest, the Issuer will
be disregarded as an entity separate from such beneficial owner and
the Notes will be characterized as debt. The parties agree that,
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the
Issuer will not file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary
returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as an entity separate from its
owner. In the event that the Issuer is deemed to have more than one
beneficial owner for federal income tax purposes, the Issuer will
file returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as a partnership (that is not
treated as a publicly traded partnership), and this Agreement shall
be amended to include such provisions as may be required under
Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all
rights, powers and duties set forth herein to the extent not
inconsistent herewith, and in the Statutory Trust Statute with
respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner
Trustee has heretofore filed the Certificate of Trust with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by
Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust Statute, such filing
hereby being ratified and approved in all respects. Notwithstanding
anything herein or in the Statutory Trust Statute to the contrary,
it is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a “business trust” within the meaning of
Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy Code.

violations of such laws, rules, regulations or agreements which do
not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under, the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of any
Transaction Document other than UCC filings and other than
(i) approvals and authorizations that have previously been
obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(ii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not

accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

rights of creditors of limited liability companies from time to

Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or

and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents.

understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).

Residual Interestholders . Each Residual Interestholder, by
becoming a beneficial owner of the Residual Interest, hereby
acknowledges and agrees (a) that the Residual Interestholder
is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the
Certificate, to which the Residual Interestholder agrees to be

Trust Agreement
(2012-2)







SECTION 3.3. Form of the
Certificate . Each Certificate, upon issuance, will be issued
in the form of a typewritten Certificate representing a definitive
Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto.
The Owner Trustee shall execute and authenticate or cause to be
authenticated, each definitive Certificate in accordance with the
written instructions of the Seller.

SECTION 3.4. Registration of the
Certificates . The Owner Trustee shall maintain at its office
referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the Residual
Interestholder at the time of such appointment, a register for the
registration and transfer of any Certificate.

SECTION 3.5. Transfer of the
Certificate . (a) The Certificateholder may assign, convey
or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and interest
in the Certificate; provided , that (i) the Owner
Trustee and the Issuer receive an Opinion of Counsel stating that,
in the opinion of such counsel, such transfer will not cause the
Issuer to be treated as a publicly traded partnership for federal
income tax purposes and (ii) the Certificate may not be
acquired by or for the account of or with any assets of a Benefit
Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., church or any other employee
benefit plan or retirement arrangement that is subject to Similar
Law; provided that the condition set forth in (i)
 above will not apply to a transfer of 100% of the Certificate
or Certificates to an Affiliate of the Seller or its designated
nominee, provided such Affiliate shall certify in writing to the
Owner Trustee that it is a C Corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(2) of the
Code) or a disregarded entity 100% owned (directly or indirectly)
by a C Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (within the
meaning of Section 1361(a)(2) of the Code). By accepting and
holding a Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder thereof
shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not,
and is not purchasing the Certificate (or any interest therein) on
behalf of or with any assets of, a Benefit Plan or any
governmental, non-U.S., church or any other employee benefit plan
or retirement arrangement that is subject to Similar Law. The Owner
Trustee shall have no duty to independently determine that the
requirement in (ii)  above is met and shall incur no
liability to any person in the event the holder of the Certificate
does not comply with such restrictions. Subject to the transfer
restrictions contained herein and in the Certificate, the
Certificateholder may transfer all or any portion of the beneficial
interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate upon surrender
thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied by the documents required
by this Section. Such transfer may be made by the registered
Certificateholder in person or by his attorney duly authorized in
writing upon surrender of the Certificate to the Owner Trustee
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and with such
signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons
signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents and
receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s Certificate,
the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such transferee as a
Certificateholder and its percentage of beneficial interest in the
Issuer in the Certificate register and issue, execute and deliver
to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such beneficial
interest in the Issuer. In the event a transferor transfers only a
portion of its beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee
shall register and issue to such transferor a new Certificate
evidencing such transferor’s new percentage of beneficial
interest in the Issuer. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the
issuance of the new Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee
shall cancel and destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in
connection with such transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the sole
owner of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by such
Certificate.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless each of
the transferor and the transferee have certified to the Owner
Trustee that such transfer does not violate any of the transfer
restrictions stated herein including, but not limited to clauses
(d)  and (e)  of this Section 3.5
. The Owner Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for
registering any transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer (or purported
transfer) of all or any part of a Certificateholder’s
interest (or any economic interest therein), whether to another
Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder,
shall be effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer)
shall be void ab initio , and no person shall
otherwise become a Certificateholder if, after such transfer (or
purported transfer), the Issuer would have more than 95 direct or
indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates and the
Non-Investment Grade Notes (unless, with respect to the
Non-Investment Grade Notes, a Debt-For-Tax Opinion has been
delivered). For purposes of determining whether the Issuer will
have more than 95 holders of an interest in the Certificates and
the Non-Investment Grade Notes, as applicable, each Person
indirectly owning an interest through a partnership (including any
entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes), a
grantor trust or an S corporation (each such entity, a “
flow-through entity ”) shall be treated as a
Certificateholder or Noteholder, as applicable, unless the Seller
determines in its sole and absolute discretion, after consulting
with qualified tax counsel, that less than substantially all of the
value of the beneficial owner’s interest in the flow-through
entity is attributable to the flow-through entity’s interest
(direct or indirect) in the Issuer.

(e) No transfer shall be permitted
if the same is effected through an established securities market or
secondary market or substantial equivalent thereof within the
meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or would make the Issuer
ineligible for “safe harbor” treatment under
Section 7704 of the Code.

(f) Each transferee (i) shall
be required to represent and warrant that it is a Person who is a
U.S. Tax Person and (ii) shall provide a certification of
non-foreign status, in such form as may be requested by the Seller
or the Owner Trustee (e.g. IRS Form W-9), signed under penalties of
perjury (and such other certification, representations or opinion
of counsel as may be requested by the Seller or the Owner
Trustee).

SECTION 3.6. Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such
security or indemnity as may be requested by the Owner Trustee to
save it harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a
new

Trust Agreement
(2012-2)






Certificate for the same percentage of
beneficial interest in the Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen, of like tenor and bearing a different
issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee
shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under
this Section 3.6 , the Issuer or Owner Trustee may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer
and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the
Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 3.7. Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . The Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Residual Interestholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Seller or an affiliate of
the Seller is the sole Residual Interestholder. Any Certificate
Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from
the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such
power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement
in any material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
initially be U.S. Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the
Certificate Paying Agent. U.S. Bank shall be permitted to resign as
Certificate Paying Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written
notice to the Owner Trustee. If U.S. Bank shall no longer be the
Certificate Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a
successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank
or trust company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent
appointed by the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver to the Owner
Trustee an instrument in which such successor Certificate Paying
Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree with the
Owner Trustee that as Certificate Paying Agent, such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent
shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Residual
Interestholders in trust for the benefit of the Residual
Interestholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to
such Residual Interestholders. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of
a Certificate Paying Agent such Certificate Paying Agent shall also
return all funds in its possession to the Owner Trustee. The
rights, protections, indemnities and immunities of the Owner
Trustee under this Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also
in its role as Certificate Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar
for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying
Agent or Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to
any other paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating
agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.

TRUSTEE

Residual Interestholder with Respect to Certain Matters. With
respect to the following matters, the Owner Trustee shall not take

notice as is practicable), the Owner Trustee shall have notified
the Residual Interestholder in writing of the proposed action and
the Residual Interestholder shall not have notified the Owner
Trustee in writing that the Residual Interestholder has withheld
consent or provided alternative direction:

by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the consent of
any Noteholder is required;

(b) the amendment of the Indenture
by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the consent of
any Noteholder is not required and such amendment materially
adversely affects the interests of the Residual
Interestholder;

(c) the amendment, change or
modification of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or the
Administration Agreement, except to cure any ambiguity or defect or
to amend or supplement any provision in a manner that would not
materially adversely affect the interests of the Residual
Interestholder; or

(d) the appointment pursuant to the
Indenture of a successor Indenture Trustee or the consent to the
assignment by the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee of its
obligations under the Indenture or this Agreement, as

the prior written consent of the Owner Trustee and 100% of the
Residual Interestholders, commence a Bankruptcy Event with respect
to the Issuer. In considering whether to give or withhold written
consent to the Bankruptcy Event by the Issuer, the Owner Trustee,
with the consent of the Residual Interestholder, shall consider the
interests of the Noteholders in addition to the interests of the
Issuer and whether the Issuer is insolvent. The Owner Trustee shall
have no duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Event by
the Issuer if the Owner Trustee shall not have been furnished (at
the expense of the Person that requested such letter be furnished
to the Owner Trustee) a letter from an independent accounting firm
of national reputation
