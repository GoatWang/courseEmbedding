We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the
selling stockholders named in this prospectus. All proceeds from the sale of the
common stock will be paid directly to the selling stockholders.
 
We would, however, receive proceeds upon the exercise of the warrants held by
the selling stockholders which, if such warrants are exercised in full (and
assuming no “cashless” exercise features are utilized), would be approximately
$8,746,360. Proceeds, if any, received from the exercise of such warrants will
be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. No assurances can be
given that any of such warrants will be exercised.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and
characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense research and
development efforts.  We expect to compete with companies, including major
international pharmaceutical companies that have substantially greater
financial, research and development, marketing and sales capabilities and have
substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing
of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and selling
biopharmaceutical products.  We will face competition based on, among other
things, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory
approvals, product ease of use and price.
 
Our primary competitors in the CMBC field are Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN)
in the United States and IGEA Medical S.p.A. in Europe, both of which are
developing alternative treatment therapies for CMBC. Celsion Corporation is
developing a drug treatment for CMBC that is activated by a hyperthermia device
and has completed Phase 1/2 studies in CMBC. IGEA Medical S.p.A. is developing
an electro-chemotherapy treatment for CMBC. Pinnacle Biologics Inc., a
subsidiary of Concordia Healthcare Corp (NASDAQ: CXRX), sells Photofrin, a first
generation PDT product for treatment of certain endobronchial non-small-cell
lung cancers and esophageal cancers. Photofrin is currently in Phase 2 studies
in recurrent glioma. To our knowledge, there is no reported development program
for Photofrin in CMBC. Rogers Sciences Inc. is a medical device company that is
developing a light delivery device for use with PDT treatment of cutaneous
cancers that they are currently clinically testing in a Phase 2 study in CMBC
patients.
 
There are numerous therapies currently used to treat CMBC patients including
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical excision, hyperthermia, cryotherapy,
electro-chemotherapy, topical drugs and intra-lesional chemotherapy injections,
but, to our knowledge, there are no PDT therapies currently approved by the FDA
for the treatment of CMBC or similar cutaneous cancers. Some topical PDT agents
have been approved by the FDA for actinic keratosis which is a precancerous skin
condition and they have been approved in some other countries for some
conditions that we believe pose low medical risk such as basal cell cancer and
acne.


Company Description
We are a biopharmaceutical company, focused on the development of photodynamic
therapy (“PDT”) for the treatment of rare, unmet medical needs. PDT is a
treatment that uses light sensitive compounds, or photosensitizers, that, when
exposed to specific wavelengths of light, act as a catalyst to


 produce a form of
oxygen that induces local tumor cell death. Our lead product candidate, the
REM-001 Therapy product, consists of three parts, the laser light source, the
light delivery device and the drug REM-001 (collectively, the “REM-001
Therapy”). REM-001 is a second generation photosensitizer drug that has
undergone late stage clinical development and which we believe possesses
multiple advantages over earlier generation PDT compounds. Our lead indication
is unresectable cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (“CMBC”), a disease that may
strike individuals with advanced breast cancer and for which effective treatment
options are limited. In four Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical trials in CMBC
patients, primarily targeting patients who had previously received chemotherapy
and failed radiation therapy, our REM-001 Therapy was able to reduce or
eliminate a substantial number of the treated CMBC tumors. Specifically, our
analysis of the data collected from these trials indicates that in approximately
80% of evaluable tumor sites treated with REM-001 Therapy, there was a complete
response, meaning that follow-up clinical assessments indicated no visible
evidence of the tumor remaining. We believe clinical data indicates that REM-001
Therapy holds promise as a treatment to locally eliminate or slow the growth of
treated cutaneous cancerous tumors in this difficult-to-treat patient
population.
 
In 2012, we acquired certain assets and regulatory filings, including REM-001
Therapy developed by Miravant Medical Technologies, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, a former public pharmaceutical and research development company
(collectively, “Miravant”), and the associated technology, clinical data and
intellectual property, from a creditor of Miravant. Between February 1996 and
January 1999, Miravant, with support from certain corporate partners, conducted
the above-referenced four Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical trials for the
treatment of CMBC using REM-001 Therapy (collectively, the “Miravant CMBC
Trials”). The primary motivation behind our acquisition was to secure the rights
to the REM-001 Therapy and its associated technology, proprietary processes and
regulatory filings which have already undergone substantial clinical
development, which we believe will help expedite the process of gaining
regulatory approval to market our REM-001 Therapy.
 
Our initial product goal is to achieve marketing approval of REM-001 Therapy for
the treatment of CMBC in the United States. We conducted a first
preliminaryanalysis of all existing REM-001 Therapy clinical trial data for
CMBC, including data from the Miravant CMBC Trials. We then conducted a more
in-depth analysis that was overseen by regulatory experts who have expertise in
interacting with the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The experts we
engaged were either former FDA employees with directly related experience in
reviewing similar oncology treatments or individuals who have provided senior
regulatory guidance to major pharmaceutical or medical device companies in
situations that led to regulatory approval. The results of this second more
in-depth analysis were consistent with our original analysis. As a result of our
review, we submitted questions to FDA under a Type C format to review the
technology and results and determine the anticipated requirements for regulatory
approval. On March 3, 2017, we received FDA’s written response to our questions.
Based on that response, we believe our plans to manufacture REM-001 by revising
the prior quality standards to meet the currently recommended regulatory
standards will be acceptable. FDA also indicated our plans for utilizing light
delivery devices that have been shown to be functionally equivalent to the
devices used by Miravant will be acceptable. FDA also recognized that CMBC
represents an unmet clinical need and provided guidance on a number of clinical
pharmacology parameters they would like us to measure in our planned clinical
trial. Based on FDA’s responses, we plan to conduct a clinical trial in CMBC to
test the safety and efficacy of REM-001 Therapy for marketing approval and we
are planning further discussions with FDA regarding the specifics of such a
trial.
 
We also believe REM-001 Therapy holds promise as a treatment for cutaneous
metastatic cancers other than CMBC as well as locally advanced basal cell cancer
such as often occurs in patients with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome and cutaneously
recurrent basal cell cancer.

Pharmacy Choice - Pharmaceutical News - Adgero Biopharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. Announces $2.0 Million Investment from Strategic Asian Investor - July 25, 2017
Pharmacy News Article






							 2/22/17 - Adgero Biopharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. Announces $2.0 Million Investment from Strategic Asian Investor
						



PRINCETON, NJ  (Marketwired)  02/22/17  Adgero Biopharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. ("Adgero" or the "Company"), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company leveraging its late stage photodynamic therapy ("PDT") platform for the treatment of serious oncology indications, announced today that it has received a $2.0 million investment from Shanghai Fudan-Zhangjiang Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("FDZJ"), located in Shanghai, China. FDZJ is a profitable, publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of innovative biopharmaceutical products. Along with developing new technologies and products in the fields of genetic engineering and nanoparticle drug delivery, FDZJ has developed a number of PDT therapies including two approved products in China that use second generation photosensitizers.Frank Pilkiewicz, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Adgero, stated, "This investment is a notable contribution to our efforts in advancing our late stage product candidate, REM-001 Therapy, through clinical development and towards commercialization. We believe this may prove to be an important relationship for Adgero, not only with respect to FDZJ's investment and focus on biopharmaceutical products and specifically PDT, but as well as a possible opportunity to expand our reach into Asia over time."The net proceeds of the $2.0 million investment will be used to fund the advancement of Adgero's REM-001 Therapy clinical program in cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.The securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. About AdgeroAdgero Biopharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. is a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on building a pipeline by advancing its proprietary late stage photodynamic therapy ("PDT") platform with broad utility for the treatment of serious oncology indications.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the
selling stockholders named in this prospectus. All proceeds from the sale of the
common stock will be paid directly to the selling stockholders.
 
We would, however, receive proceeds upon the exercise of the warrants held by
the selling stockholders which, if such warrants are exercised in full (and
assuming no “cashless” exercise features are utilized), would be approximately
$8,746,360. Proceeds, if any, received from the exercise of such warrants will
be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. No assurances can be
given that any of such warrants will be exercised.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and
characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense research and
development efforts.  We expect to compete with companies, including major
international pharmaceutical companies that have substantially greater
financial, research and development, marketing and sales capabilities and have
substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing
of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and selling
biopharmaceutical products.  We will face competition based on, among other
things, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory
approvals, product ease of use and price.
 
Our primary competitors in the CMBC field are Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN)
in the United States and IGEA Medical S.p.A. in Europe, both of which are
developing alternative treatment therapies for CMBC. Celsion Corporation is
developing a drug treatment for CMBC that is activated by a hyperthermia device
and has completed Phase 1/2 studies in CMBC. IGEA Medical S.p.A. is developing
an electro-chemotherapy treatment for CMBC. Pinnacle Biologics Inc., a
subsidiary of Concordia Healthcare Corp (NASDAQ: CXRX), sells Photofrin, a first
generation PDT product for treatment of certain endobronchial non-small-cell
lung cancers and esophageal cancers. Photofrin is currently in Phase 2 studies
in recurrent glioma. To our knowledge, there is no reported development program
for Photofrin in CMBC. Rogers Sciences Inc. is a medical device company that is
developing a light delivery device for use with PDT treatment of cutaneous
cancers that they are currently clinically testing in a Phase 2 study in CMBC
patients.
 
There are numerous therapies currently used to treat CMBC patients including
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical excision, hyperthermia, cryotherapy,
electro-chemotherapy, topical drugs and intra-lesional chemotherapy injections,
but, to our knowledge, there are no PDT therapies currently approved by the FDA
for the treatment of CMBC or similar cutaneous cancers. Some topical PDT agents
have been approved by the FDA for actinic keratosis which is a precancerous skin
condition and they have been approved in some other countries for some
conditions that we believe pose low medical risk such as basal cell cancer and
acne.


Company Description
We are a biopharmaceutical company, focused on the development of photodynamic
therapy (“PDT”) for the treatment of rare, unmet medical needs. PDT is a
treatment that uses light sensitive compounds, or photosensitizers, that, when
exposed to specific wavelengths of light, act as a catalyst to


 produce a form of
oxygen that induces local tumor cell death. Our lead product candidate, the
REM-001 Therapy product, consists of three parts, the laser light source, the
light delivery device and the drug REM-001 (collectively, the “REM-001
Therapy”). REM-001 is a second generation photosensitizer drug that has
undergone late stage clinical development and which we believe possesses
multiple advantages over earlier generation PDT compounds. Our lead indication
is unresectable cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (“CMBC”), a disease that may
strike individuals with advanced breast cancer and for which effective treatment
options are limited. In four Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical trials in CMBC
patients, primarily targeting patients who had previously received chemotherapy
and failed radiation therapy, our REM-001 Therapy was able to reduce or
eliminate a substantial number of the treated CMBC tumors. Specifically, our
analysis of the data collected from these trials indicates that in approximately
80% of evaluable tumor sites treated with REM-001 Therapy, there was a complete
response, meaning that follow-up clinical assessments indicated no visible
evidence of the tumor remaining. We believe clinical data indicates that REM-001
Therapy holds promise as a treatment to locally eliminate or slow the growth of
treated cutaneous cancerous tumors in this difficult-to-treat patient
population.
 
In 2012, we acquired certain assets and regulatory filings, including REM-001
Therapy developed by Miravant Medical Technologies, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, a former public pharmaceutical and research development company
(collectively, “Miravant”), and the associated technology, clinical data and
intellectual property, from a creditor of Miravant. Between February 1996 and
January 1999, Miravant, with support from certain corporate partners, conducted
the above-referenced four Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical trials for the
treatment of CMBC using REM-001 Therapy (collectively, the “Miravant CMBC
Trials”). The primary motivation behind our acquisition was to secure the rights
to the REM-001 Therapy and its associated technology, proprietary processes and
regulatory filings which have already undergone substantial clinical
development, which we believe will help expedite the process of gaining
regulatory approval to market our REM-001 Therapy.
 
Our initial product goal is to achieve marketing approval of REM-001 Therapy for
the treatment of CMBC in the United States. We conducted a first
preliminaryanalysis of all existing REM-001 Therapy clinical trial data for
CMBC, including data from the Miravant CMBC Trials. We then conducted a more
in-depth analysis that was overseen by regulatory experts who have expertise in
interacting with the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The experts we
engaged were either former FDA employees with directly related experience in
reviewing similar oncology treatments or individuals who have provided senior
regulatory guidance to major pharmaceutical or medical device companies in
situations that led to regulatory approval. The results of this second more
in-depth analysis were consistent with our original analysis. As a result of our
review, we submitted questions to FDA under a Type C format to review the
technology and results and determine the anticipated requirements for regulatory
approval. On March 3, 2017, we received FDA’s written response to our questions.
Based on that response, we believe our plans to manufacture REM-001 by revising
the prior quality standards to meet the currently recommended regulatory
standards will be acceptable. FDA also indicated our plans for utilizing light
delivery devices that have been shown to be functionally equivalent to the
devices used by Miravant will be acceptable. FDA also recognized that CMBC
represents an unmet clinical need and provided guidance on a number of clinical
pharmacology parameters they would like us to measure in our planned clinical
trial. Based on FDA’s responses, we plan to conduct a clinical trial in CMBC to
test the safety and efficacy of REM-001 Therapy for marketing approval and we
are planning further discussions with FDA regarding the specifics of such a
trial.
 
We also believe REM-001 Therapy holds promise as a treatment for cutaneous
metastatic cancers other than CMBC as well as locally advanced basal cell cancer
such as often occurs in patients with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome and cutaneously
recurrent basal cell cancer.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
