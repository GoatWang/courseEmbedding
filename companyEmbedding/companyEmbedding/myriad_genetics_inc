Companion Diagnostics

BRACAnalysis CDx is an FDA-approved laboratory developed test for BRCA1 and BRCA2 intended to inform patient management related to the PARP inhibitors, LynparzaTM (olaparib) and Zejula™ (niraparib).1,2,3

Making a decision on treatment options for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer is an important choice and one that should be made with the best information possible. EndoPredict can help accurately determine an individual patient’s 10 year risk of recurrence to help physicians identify which patients may consider can safely forgoing chemotherapy.

myChoice® HRD is a test currently being developed by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, which seeks to identify patients whose tumor has Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD).
Hereditary Cancers

Myriad myRisk® Hereditary Cancer is a 28-gene panel that helps to determine a patient’s risk by evaluating a number of hereditary cancer syndromes, with focus on eight primary cancer sites.

The BRACAnalysis ® test assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer based on the detection of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

COLARIS® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer and a woman’s risk of developing hereditary uterine/endometrial cancer by detecting disease-causing mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 genes.

COLARIS AP ® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary colorectal polyps and cancer by detecting mutations in the APC and MYH genes.

MELARIS® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary melanoma by detecting inherited mutations in the p16 gene (also called CDKN2A or INK4A ).

PANEXIA® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary pancreatic cancer by analyzing the PALB2 and BRCA2 genes, which are most commonly mutated in families with hereditary pancreatic cancer.
Lung Cancer

Myriad myPlan® Lung Cancer is a molecular diagnostic test that measures the expression levels of cell cycle progression genes to provide an accurate assessment of cancer aggressiveness in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.
Melanoma

Myriad myPath™ Melanoma is a unique molecular diagnostic test that analyzes 23 genes to assist in the timely and accurate diagnosis of melanoma.
Neuroscience

GeneSight is a clinically proven test to enhance medication selection for healthcare providers, helping them get their patients on the right medications faster. Powered by CPGxTM, GeneSight is a proprietary combinatorial pharmacogenomics technology that analyzes how an individual’s genetic variations affect his or her response to medications and provides an actionable, easy to interpret report. GeneSight is used by healthcare providers to help patients that are affected by neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other behavioral health conditions, as well as chronic pain.

Prostate Cancer

Prolaris® is a molecular diagnostic test that measures the expression level of genes involved with tumor proliferation to predict disease outcome. Prolaris® can be used in conjunction with other clinical parameters to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness.
Rheumatoid Arthritis

Vectra® DA is a multi-biomarker molecular blood test that simultaneously measures 12 key biomarkers to provide an objective and reproducible measure of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity.
 
Sources:


Intended Use:BRACAnalysis CDx® is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the qualitative detection and classification of variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes using genomic DNA obtained from whole blood specimens collected in EDTA.  Single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing.  Large deletions and duplications in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected using multiplex PCR.

 
Results of the test are used as an aid in identifying ovarian cancer patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants, who are or may become eligible for treatment with Lynparza™ (olaparib). Detection of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants by the BRACAnalysis CDx test in ovarian cancer patients is also associated with enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) from Zejula™ (niraparib) maintenance therapy. This assay is for professional use only and is to be performed only at 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108.

For more detailed information about Lynparza and its safety and efficacy please go to lynparza.com
For more detailed information about Zejula and its safety and efficacy please go to zejula.com

Lynparza is a trademark of the AstraZeneca group of companies, Zejula is a trademark of Tesaro, Inc.





Myriad Promise
At Myriad, we’re committed to making sure our tests are available to the patients who need them.

Companion Diagnostics

BRACAnalysis CDx is an FDA-approved laboratory developed test for BRCA1 and BRCA2 intended to inform patient management related to the PARP inhibitors, LynparzaTM (olaparib) and Zejula™ (niraparib).1,2,3

Making a decision on treatment options for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer is an important choice and one that should be made with the best information possible. EndoPredict can help accurately determine an individual patient’s 10 year risk of recurrence to help physicians identify which patients may consider can safely forgoing chemotherapy.

myChoice® HRD is a test currently being developed by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, which seeks to identify patients whose tumor has Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD).
Hereditary Cancers

Myriad myRisk® Hereditary Cancer is a 28-gene panel that helps to determine a patient’s risk by evaluating a number of hereditary cancer syndromes, with focus on eight primary cancer sites.

The BRACAnalysis ® test assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer based on the detection of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

COLARIS® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer and a woman’s risk of developing hereditary uterine/endometrial cancer by detecting disease-causing mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 genes.

COLARIS AP ® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary colorectal polyps and cancer by detecting mutations in the APC and MYH genes.

MELARIS® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary melanoma by detecting inherited mutations in the p16 gene (also called CDKN2A or INK4A ).

PANEXIA® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary pancreatic cancer by analyzing the PALB2 and BRCA2 genes, which are most commonly mutated in families with hereditary pancreatic cancer.
Lung Cancer

Myriad myPlan® Lung Cancer is a molecular diagnostic test that measures the expression levels of cell cycle progression genes to provide an accurate assessment of cancer aggressiveness in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.
Melanoma

Myriad myPath™ Melanoma is a unique molecular diagnostic test that analyzes 23 genes to assist in the timely and accurate diagnosis of melanoma.
Neuroscience

GeneSight is a clinically proven test to enhance medication selection for healthcare providers, helping them get their patients on the right medications faster. Powered by CPGxTM, GeneSight is a proprietary combinatorial pharmacogenomics technology that analyzes how an individual’s genetic variations affect his or her response to medications and provides an actionable, easy to interpret report. GeneSight is used by healthcare providers to help patients that are affected by neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other behavioral health conditions, as well as chronic pain.

Prostate Cancer

Prolaris® is a molecular diagnostic test that measures the expression level of genes involved with tumor proliferation to predict disease outcome. Prolaris® can be used in conjunction with other clinical parameters to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness.
Rheumatoid Arthritis

Vectra® DA is a multi-biomarker molecular blood test that simultaneously measures 12 key biomarkers to provide an objective and reproducible measure of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity.
 
Sources:


Intended Use:BRACAnalysis CDx® is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the qualitative detection and classification of variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes using genomic DNA obtained from whole blood specimens collected in EDTA.  Single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing.  Large deletions and duplications in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected using multiplex PCR.

 
Results of the test are used as an aid in identifying ovarian cancer patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants, who are or may become eligible for treatment with Lynparza™ (olaparib). Detection of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants by the BRACAnalysis CDx test in ovarian cancer patients is also associated with enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) from Zejula™ (niraparib) maintenance therapy. This assay is for professional use only and is to be performed only at 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108.

For more detailed information about Lynparza and its safety and efficacy please go to lynparza.com
For more detailed information about Zejula and its safety and efficacy please go to zejula.com

Lynparza is a trademark of the AstraZeneca group of companies, Zejula is a trademark of Tesaro, Inc.





Myriad Promise
At Myriad, we’re committed to making sure our tests are available to the patients who need them.

Myriad Genetics, Inc. is an American molecular diagnostic company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Myriad employs a number of proprietary technologies that permit doctors and patients to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes play in the onset, progression and treatment of disease. This information is used to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic products that assess an individual's risk for developing disease later in life (predictive medicine), identify a patient's likelihood of responding to a particular drug therapy (personalized medicine), assess a patient's risk of disease progression and disease recurrence (personalized medicine), and measure disease activity. Myriad's discovery of the breast cancer gene, BRCA1 was universally acclaimed as a monumental achievement: “There is no more exciting story in medical science.”[1] Myriad was the subject of scrutiny after it became involved in a lawsuit over its patenting practices,[2][3][4] which led to the landmark Supreme Court decision Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc..
In August 2016 Myriad announced it would acquire Assurex Health for up to $410 million, expanding the company's genetic testing for psychotropic medicine selection.[5]

History[edit]
The global search for the genetic basis of breast and ovarian cancers began in earnest in 1988. In 1990, at an American Society of Human Genetics Meeting, a team of scientists led by Mary-Claire King, Ph.D., from the University of California, Berkeley announced the localization through linkage analysis of a gene associated with increased risk for breast cancer (BRCA1) to the long arm of chromosome 17.[6] In August 1994, Mark Skolnick and researchers at Myriad, along with colleagues at the University of Utah, the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH), and McGill University sequenced BRCA1.[7] In 2013, the actress Angelina Jolie had her ovaries removed because she tested positive for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. This led to a surge in demand by women for genetic testing.[8]
Founders[edit]
The founders of Myriad are Peter Meldrum (past President and CEO of Agridyne and past CEO and President of Myriad Genetics, Inc), Kevin Kimberlin (Chairman of Spencer Trask & Co.), Dr. Walter Gilbert (Founder of Biogen) and Mark Skolnick (Adjunct Professor in the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah).[9][10]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Subsidiaries of Myriad Genetics include Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., Myriad RBM, Crescendo Bioscience, Sividon Diagnostics, and, most recently, Assurex Health.

Controversies[edit]
Myriad Genetics's intention to patent human genes led to intense controversy.[13][14] First, because genes occur naturally in every human, and in addition to moral questions raised, patenting them would constitute an obstacle to biomedical research worldwide. Secondly, because the discovery of their relevance to breast cancer[15][16] was funded by the public. Third, because the company was selling its breast cancer diagnostic test for a price many described as "outrageous":[17] $4000, the price of a whole genome sequencing[18] (around 20,000 genes analyzed), when the test only looked at two genes.
USA: Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (2013)[edit]
Myriad Genetics was a defendant in the case Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (formerly Association For Molecular Pathology et al. v. United States Patent and Trademark Office[19]). Lawyers at the ACLU served as counsel for the plaintiffs. In the suit, medical associations, doctors, and patients sued Myriad Genetics to challenge seven United States patents on genes related to breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[20]
Two of the company's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were ruled invalid on March 29, 2010 by Judge Robert W. Sweet in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.[2][3][4] On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the trial court in an opinion dated July 29, 2011 and held that the genes were eligible for patents.[21]
On December 7, 2011, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.[22] On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., in which the Supreme Court had ruled, just six days earlier, that more restrictive rules were required to patent observations about natural phenomena.[23]
On August 16, 2012, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed Myriad's right to patent the genes although they denied rights to patent comparisons of DNA sequences.[24] On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a second challenge to the two gene patents held by Myriad.[25] Oral argument took place on April 15, 2013.[26] On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated", invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature—such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA (cDNA)—could still be eligible for patent protection.[27][28]
Australia: D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc (2015)[edit]
Myriad Genetics has also been involved in litigation in Australia over the patentability of DNA sequences. Regarding BRCA1, the company succeeded in the Federal Court, both at first instance and on appeal to the full court, but in October 2015 lost in a unanimous decision of the High Court, D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc.[29][30][31]
In Australia an invention is patentable if, to begin with, it is a "manner of manufacture".[32] The plurality in the High Court formulated the key question as: "Whether the invention as claimed is for a product made, or a process producing an outcome as a result of human action" (para [28]). It held that the product in issue continued to consist basically of genetic information that occurs naturally, had not been altered as a result of human action, therefore had not been "manufactured" and consequently was not patentable. The plurality reflected that a broader conception of patentability could, both by creating virtual monopolies and by blurring the boundaries of what might come to be patented, produce a chilling effect on research and application, contrary to the purposes of patent protection.
The appellant had cited the recent US Supreme Court decision for comparison. The High Court was also aware that its decision could conflict with recent judicial decisions, as well as patents legislation, in other countries, and possibly with Australia's international obligations; however, it considered these to be issues for the legislature, as well as denying that its decision in this case was intended to set a precedent with regard to genetic patenting generally. In addition, the rest of the court did not dissent from Gordon J's concluding observation: "It is important to notice that the claims made in the patents in suit in the United States of America considered in Association for Molecular Pathology v Myriad Genetics Inc 186 L Ed 2d 124 (2013) were claims to the particular genetic sequences and therefore radically different from the disputed claims in this appeal" (note 232).

Myriad Genetics, Inc. is an American molecular diagnostic company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Myriad employs a number of proprietary technologies that permit doctors and patients to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes play in the onset, progression and treatment of disease. This information is used to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic products that assess an individual's risk for developing disease later in life (predictive medicine), identify a patient's likelihood of responding to a particular drug therapy (personalized medicine), assess a patient's risk of disease progression and disease recurrence (personalized medicine), and measure disease activity. Myriad's discovery of the breast cancer gene, BRCA1 was universally acclaimed as a monumental achievement: “There is no more exciting story in medical science.”[1] Myriad was the subject of scrutiny after it became involved in a lawsuit over its patenting practices,[2][3][4] which led to the landmark Supreme Court decision Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc..
In August 2016 Myriad announced it would acquire Assurex Health for up to $410 million, expanding the company's genetic testing for psychotropic medicine selection.[5]

History[edit]
The global search for the genetic basis of breast and ovarian cancers began in earnest in 1988. In 1990, at an American Society of Human Genetics Meeting, a team of scientists led by Mary-Claire King, Ph.D., from the University of California, Berkeley announced the localization through linkage analysis of a gene associated with increased risk for breast cancer (BRCA1) to the long arm of chromosome 17.[6] In August 1994, Mark Skolnick and researchers at Myriad, along with colleagues at the University of Utah, the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH), and McGill University sequenced BRCA1.[7] In 2013, the actress Angelina Jolie had her ovaries removed because she tested positive for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. This led to a surge in demand by women for genetic testing.[8]
Founders[edit]
The founders of Myriad are Peter Meldrum (past President and CEO of Agridyne and past CEO and President of Myriad Genetics, Inc), Kevin Kimberlin (Chairman of Spencer Trask & Co.), Dr. Walter Gilbert (Founder of Biogen) and Mark Skolnick (Adjunct Professor in the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah).[9][10]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Subsidiaries of Myriad Genetics include Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., Myriad RBM, Crescendo Bioscience, Sividon Diagnostics, and, most recently, Assurex Health.

Controversies[edit]
Myriad Genetics's intention to patent human genes led to intense controversy.[13][14] First, because genes occur naturally in every human, and in addition to moral questions raised, patenting them would constitute an obstacle to biomedical research worldwide. Secondly, because the discovery of their relevance to breast cancer[15][16] was funded by the public. Third, because the company was selling its breast cancer diagnostic test for a price many described as "outrageous":[17] $4000, the price of a whole genome sequencing[18] (around 20,000 genes analyzed), when the test only looked at two genes.
USA: Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (2013)[edit]
Myriad Genetics was a defendant in the case Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (formerly Association For Molecular Pathology et al. v. United States Patent and Trademark Office[19]). Lawyers at the ACLU served as counsel for the plaintiffs. In the suit, medical associations, doctors, and patients sued Myriad Genetics to challenge seven United States patents on genes related to breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[20]
Two of the company's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were ruled invalid on March 29, 2010 by Judge Robert W. Sweet in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.[2][3][4] On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the trial court in an opinion dated July 29, 2011 and held that the genes were eligible for patents.[21]
On December 7, 2011, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.[22] On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., in which the Supreme Court had ruled, just six days earlier, that more restrictive rules were required to patent observations about natural phenomena.[23]
On August 16, 2012, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed Myriad's right to patent the genes although they denied rights to patent comparisons of DNA sequences.[24] On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a second challenge to the two gene patents held by Myriad.[25] Oral argument took place on April 15, 2013.[26] On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated", invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature—such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA (cDNA)—could still be eligible for patent protection.[27][28]
Australia: D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc (2015)[edit]
Myriad Genetics has also been involved in litigation in Australia over the patentability of DNA sequences. Regarding BRCA1, the company succeeded in the Federal Court, both at first instance and on appeal to the full court, but in October 2015 lost in a unanimous decision of the High Court, D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc.[29][30][31]
In Australia an invention is patentable if, to begin with, it is a "manner of manufacture".[32] The plurality in the High Court formulated the key question as: "Whether the invention as claimed is for a product made, or a process producing an outcome as a result of human action" (para [28]). It held that the product in issue continued to consist basically of genetic information that occurs naturally, had not been altered as a result of human action, therefore had not been "manufactured" and consequently was not patentable. The plurality reflected that a broader conception of patentability could, both by creating virtual monopolies and by blurring the boundaries of what might come to be patented, produce a chilling effect on research and application, contrary to the purposes of patent protection.
The appellant had cited the recent US Supreme Court decision for comparison. The High Court was also aware that its decision could conflict with recent judicial decisions, as well as patents legislation, in other countries, and possibly with Australia's international obligations; however, it considered these to be issues for the legislature, as well as denying that its decision in this case was intended to set a precedent with regard to genetic patenting generally. In addition, the rest of the court did not dissent from Gordon J's concluding observation: "It is important to notice that the claims made in the patents in suit in the United States of America considered in Association for Molecular Pathology v Myriad Genetics Inc 186 L Ed 2d 124 (2013) were claims to the particular genetic sequences and therefore radically different from the disputed claims in this appeal" (note 232).

History[edit]
The global search for the genetic basis of breast and ovarian cancers began in earnest in 1988. In 1990, at an American Society of Human Genetics Meeting, a team of scientists led by Mary-Claire King, Ph.D., from the University of California, Berkeley announced the localization through linkage analysis of a gene associated with increased risk for breast cancer (BRCA1) to the long arm of chromosome 17.[6] In August 1994, Mark Skolnick and researchers at Myriad, along with colleagues at the University of Utah, the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH), and McGill University sequenced BRCA1.[7] In 2013, the actress Angelina Jolie had her ovaries removed because she tested positive for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. This led to a surge in demand by women for genetic testing.[8]
Founders[edit]
The founders of Myriad are Peter Meldrum (past President and CEO of Agridyne and past CEO and President of Myriad Genetics, Inc), Kevin Kimberlin (Chairman of Spencer Trask & Co.), Dr. Walter Gilbert (Founder of Biogen) and Mark Skolnick (Adjunct Professor in the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah).[9][10]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Subsidiaries of Myriad Genetics include Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., Myriad RBM, Crescendo Bioscience, Sividon Diagnostics, and, most recently, Assurex Health.

Controversies[edit]
Myriad Genetics's intention to patent human genes led to intense controversy.[13][14] First, because genes occur naturally in every human, and in addition to moral questions raised, patenting them would constitute an obstacle to biomedical research worldwide. Secondly, because the discovery of their relevance to breast cancer[15][16] was funded by the public. Third, because the company was selling its breast cancer diagnostic test for a price many described as "outrageous":[17] $4000, the price of a whole genome sequencing[18] (around 20,000 genes analyzed), when the test only looked at two genes.
USA: Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (2013)[edit]
Myriad Genetics was a defendant in the case Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (formerly Association For Molecular Pathology et al. v. United States Patent and Trademark Office[19]). Lawyers at the ACLU served as counsel for the plaintiffs. In the suit, medical associations, doctors, and patients sued Myriad Genetics to challenge seven United States patents on genes related to breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[20]
Two of the company's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were ruled invalid on March 29, 2010 by Judge Robert W. Sweet in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.[2][3][4] On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the trial court in an opinion dated July 29, 2011 and held that the genes were eligible for patents.[21]
On December 7, 2011, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.[22] On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., in which the Supreme Court had ruled, just six days earlier, that more restrictive rules were required to patent observations about natural phenomena.[23]
On August 16, 2012, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed Myriad's right to patent the genes although they denied rights to patent comparisons of DNA sequences.[24] On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a second challenge to the two gene patents held by Myriad.[25] Oral argument took place on April 15, 2013.[26] On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated", invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature—such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA (cDNA)—could still be eligible for patent protection.[27][28]
Australia: D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc (2015)[edit]
Myriad Genetics has also been involved in litigation in Australia over the patentability of DNA sequences. Regarding BRCA1, the company succeeded in the Federal Court, both at first instance and on appeal to the full court, but in October 2015 lost in a unanimous decision of the High Court, D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc.[29][30][31]
In Australia an invention is patentable if, to begin with, it is a "manner of manufacture".[32] The plurality in the High Court formulated the key question as: "Whether the invention as claimed is for a product made, or a process producing an outcome as a result of human action" (para [28]). It held that the product in issue continued to consist basically of genetic information that occurs naturally, had not been altered as a result of human action, therefore had not been "manufactured" and consequently was not patentable. The plurality reflected that a broader conception of patentability could, both by creating virtual monopolies and by blurring the boundaries of what might come to be patented, produce a chilling effect on research and application, contrary to the purposes of patent protection.
The appellant had cited the recent US Supreme Court decision for comparison. The High Court was also aware that its decision could conflict with recent judicial decisions, as well as patents legislation, in other countries, and possibly with Australia's international obligations; however, it considered these to be issues for the legislature, as well as denying that its decision in this case was intended to set a precedent with regard to genetic patenting generally. In addition, the rest of the court did not dissent from Gordon J's concluding observation: "It is important to notice that the claims made in the patents in suit in the United States of America considered in Association for Molecular Pathology v Myriad Genetics Inc 186 L Ed 2d 124 (2013) were claims to the particular genetic sequences and therefore radically different from the disputed claims in this appeal" (note 232).

Myriad Genetics, Inc. is an American molecular diagnostic company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Myriad employs a number of proprietary technologies that permit doctors and patients to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes play in the onset, progression and treatment of disease. This information is used to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic products that assess an individual's risk for developing disease later in life (predictive medicine), identify a patient's likelihood of responding to a particular drug therapy (personalized medicine), assess a patient's risk of disease progression and disease recurrence (personalized medicine), and measure disease activity. Myriad's discovery of the breast cancer gene, BRCA1 was universally acclaimed as a monumental achievement: “There is no more exciting story in medical science.”[1] Myriad was the subject of scrutiny after it became involved in a lawsuit over its patenting practices,[2][3][4] which led to the landmark Supreme Court decision Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc..
In August 2016 Myriad announced it would acquire Assurex Health for up to $410 million, expanding the company's genetic testing for psychotropic medicine selection.[5]

Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated", invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature—such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA (cDNA)—could still be eligible for patent protection.[27][28]
Australia: D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc (2015)[edit]
Myriad Genetics has also been involved in litigation in Australia over the patentability of DNA sequences. Regarding BRCA1, the company succeeded in the Federal Court, both at first instance and on appeal to the full court, but in October 2015 lost in a unanimous decision of the High Court, D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc.[29][30][31]
In Australia an invention is patentable if, to begin with, it is a "manner of manufacture".[32] The plurality in the High Court formulated the key question as: "Whether the invention as claimed is for a product made, or a process producing an outcome as a result of human action" (para [28]). It held that the product in issue continued to consist basically of genetic information that occurs naturally, had not been altered as a result of human action, therefore had not been "manufactured" and consequently was not patentable. The plurality reflected that a broader conception of patentability could, both by creating virtual monopolies and by blurring the boundaries of what might come to be patented, produce a chilling effect on research and application, contrary to the purposes of patent protection.
The appellant had cited the recent US Supreme Court decision for comparison. The High Court was also aware that its decision could conflict with recent judicial decisions, as well as patents legislation, in other countries, and possibly with Australia's international obligations; however, it considered these to be issues for the legislature, as well as denying that its decision in this case was intended to set a precedent with regard to genetic patenting generally. In addition, the rest of the court did not dissent from Gordon J's concluding observation: "It is important to notice that the claims made in the patents in suit in the United States of America considered in Association for Molecular Pathology v Myriad Genetics Inc 186 L Ed 2d 124 (2013) were claims to the particular genetic sequences and therefore radically different from the disputed claims in this appeal" (note 232).

Myriad Genetics, Inc. is an American molecular diagnostic company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Myriad employs a number of proprietary technologies that permit doctors and patients to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes play in the onset, progression and treatment of disease. This information is used to guide the development of new molecular diagnostic products that assess an individual's risk for developing disease later in life (predictive medicine), identify a patient's likelihood of responding to a particular drug therapy (personalized medicine), assess a patient's risk of disease progression and disease recurrence (personalized medicine), and measure disease activity. Myriad's discovery of the breast cancer gene, BRCA1 was universally acclaimed as a monumental achievement: “There is no more exciting story in medical science.”[1] Myriad was the subject of scrutiny after it became involved in a lawsuit over its patenting practices,[2][3][4] which led to the landmark Supreme Court decision Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc..
In August 2016 Myriad announced it would acquire Assurex Health for up to $410 million, expanding the company's genetic testing for psychotropic medicine selection.[5]

History[edit]
The global search for the genetic basis of breast and ovarian cancers began in earnest in 1988. In 1990, at an American Society of Human Genetics Meeting, a team of scientists led by Mary-Claire King, Ph.D., from the University of California, Berkeley announced the localization through linkage analysis of a gene associated with increased risk for breast cancer (BRCA1) to the long arm of chromosome 17.[6] In August 1994, Mark Skolnick and researchers at Myriad, along with colleagues at the University of Utah, the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH), and McGill University sequenced BRCA1.[7] In 2013, the actress Angelina Jolie had her ovaries removed because she tested positive for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. This led to a surge in demand by women for genetic testing.[8]
Founders[edit]
The founders of Myriad are Peter Meldrum (past President and CEO of Agridyne and past CEO and President of Myriad Genetics, Inc), Kevin Kimberlin (Chairman of Spencer Trask & Co.), Dr. Walter Gilbert (Founder of Biogen) and Mark Skolnick (Adjunct Professor in the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah).[9][10]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Subsidiaries of Myriad Genetics include Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., Myriad RBM, Crescendo Bioscience, Sividon Diagnostics, and, most recently, Assurex Health.

Controversies[edit]
Myriad Genetics's intention to patent human genes led to intense controversy.[13][14] First, because genes occur naturally in every human, and in addition to moral questions raised, patenting them would constitute an obstacle to biomedical research worldwide. Secondly, because the discovery of their relevance to breast cancer[15][16] was funded by the public. Third, because the company was selling its breast cancer diagnostic test for a price many described as "outrageous":[17] $4000, the price of a whole genome sequencing[18] (around 20,000 genes analyzed), when the test only looked at two genes.
USA: Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (2013)[edit]
Myriad Genetics was a defendant in the case Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (formerly Association For Molecular Pathology et al. v. United States Patent and Trademark Office[19]). Lawyers at the ACLU served as counsel for the plaintiffs. In the suit, medical associations, doctors, and patients sued Myriad Genetics to challenge seven United States patents on genes related to breast cancer and ovarian cancer.[20]
Two of the company's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were ruled invalid on March 29, 2010 by Judge Robert W. Sweet in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.[2][3][4] On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the trial court in an opinion dated July 29, 2011 and held that the genes were eligible for patents.[21]
On December 7, 2011, the ACLU filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.[22] On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Federal Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., in which the Supreme Court had ruled, just six days earlier, that more restrictive rules were required to patent observations about natural phenomena.[23]
On August 16, 2012, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed Myriad's right to patent the genes although they denied rights to patent comparisons of DNA sequences.[24] On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a second challenge to the two gene patents held by Myriad.[25] Oral argument took place on April 15, 2013.[26] On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated", invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature—such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA (cDNA)—could still be eligible for patent protection.[27][28]
Australia: D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc (2015)[edit]
Myriad Genetics has also been involved in litigation in Australia over the patentability of DNA sequences. Regarding BRCA1, the company succeeded in the Federal Court, both at first instance and on appeal to the full court, but in October 2015 lost in a unanimous decision of the High Court, D'Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc.[29][30][31]
In Australia an invention is patentable if, to begin with, it is a "manner of manufacture".[32] The plurality in the High Court formulated the key question as: "Whether the invention as claimed is for a product made, or a process producing an outcome as a result of human action" (para [28]).

On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear argument on the patentability of human genes. The ACLU argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 15, 2013. We expect a decision this summer.

Prolaris: A Prognostic Medicine Product for Prostate Cancer
Prolaris is a genomic test developed to aid healthcare professionals in predicting prostate cancer aggressiveness in conjunction with clinical parameters such as Gleason score and PSA.
Prolaris is the first prognostic test that offers a direct measure of the molecular biology of an individual patient’s prostate cancer. By measuring the expression levels of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation, Prolaris is able to more accurately predict disease aggressiveness.
Prolaris has been shown to be the single most clinically significant prognostic parameter of outcomes at the time of diagnosis. The test provides unique additional information that can be combined with standard clinical factors to make the most accurate prediction of a patient’s prostate cancer aggressiveness Prolaris has been extensively validated across multiple patient cohorts in both pre- and post-treatment scenarios.
Learn more about Prolaris
Prolaris as a Tool in Prostate Cancer Treatment
Prolaris is a risk stratification tool, designed to measure the aggressiveness of a patient’s cancer to better predict that individual’s risk of disease progression within ten years. It can enable healthcare professionals to better define a treatment/monitoring strategy for their patients.
In the treatment of prostate cancer, Prolaris is prognostic at the point of diagnosis and in the post-surgery setting:

At diagnosis, Prolaris can help to identify patients with less aggressive cancer who may be candidates for active surveillance.  In addition, Prolaris can identify patients who appear to be clinically low risk, but have a more aggressive disease that requires more extensive treatment.
Prolaris testing is well suited for use in post-prostatectomy patients who have higher risk features after surgery to better estimate their risk of disease recurrence (biochemical recurrence, or BCR) and therefore adjust the level of monitoring or add additional therapy.

Companion Diagnostics

BRACAnalysis CDx is an FDA-approved laboratory developed test for BRCA1 and BRCA2 intended to inform patient management related to the PARP inhibitors, LynparzaTM (olaparib) and Zejula™ (niraparib).1,2,3

Making a decision on treatment options for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer is an important choice and one that should be made with the best information possible. EndoPredict can help accurately determine an individual patient’s 10 year risk of recurrence to help physicians identify which patients may consider can safely forgoing chemotherapy.

myChoice® HRD is a test currently being developed by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, which seeks to identify patients whose tumor has Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD).
Hereditary Cancers

Myriad myRisk® Hereditary Cancer is a 28-gene panel that helps to determine a patient’s risk by evaluating a number of hereditary cancer syndromes, with focus on eight primary cancer sites.

The BRACAnalysis ® test assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer based on the detection of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

COLARIS® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer and a woman’s risk of developing hereditary uterine/endometrial cancer by detecting disease-causing mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 genes.

COLARIS AP ® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary colorectal polyps and cancer by detecting mutations in the APC and MYH genes.

MELARIS® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary melanoma by detecting inherited mutations in the p16 gene (also called CDKN2A or INK4A ).

PANEXIA® testing assesses a person’s risk of developing hereditary pancreatic cancer by analyzing the PALB2 and BRCA2 genes, which are most commonly mutated in families with hereditary pancreatic cancer.
Lung Cancer

Myriad myPlan® Lung Cancer is a molecular diagnostic test that measures the expression levels of cell cycle progression genes to provide an accurate assessment of cancer aggressiveness in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.
Melanoma

Myriad myPath™ Melanoma is a unique molecular diagnostic test that analyzes 23 genes to assist in the timely and accurate diagnosis of melanoma.
Neuroscience

GeneSight is a clinically proven test to enhance medication selection for healthcare providers, helping them get their patients on the right medications faster. Powered by CPGxTM, GeneSight is a proprietary combinatorial pharmacogenomics technology that analyzes how an individual’s genetic variations affect his or her response to medications and provides an actionable, easy to interpret report. GeneSight is used by healthcare providers to help patients that are affected by neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other behavioral health conditions, as well as chronic pain.

Prostate Cancer

Prolaris® is a molecular diagnostic test that measures the expression level of genes involved with tumor proliferation to predict disease outcome. Prolaris® can be used in conjunction with other clinical parameters to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness.
Rheumatoid Arthritis

Vectra® DA is a multi-biomarker molecular blood test that simultaneously measures 12 key biomarkers to provide an objective and reproducible measure of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity.
 
Sources:


Intended Use:BRACAnalysis CDx® is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the qualitative detection and classification of variants in the protein coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes using genomic DNA obtained from whole blood specimens collected in EDTA.  Single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing.  Large deletions and duplications in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are detected using multiplex PCR.

 
Results of the test are used as an aid in identifying ovarian cancer patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants, who are or may become eligible for treatment with Lynparza™ (olaparib). Detection of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants by the BRACAnalysis CDx test in ovarian cancer patients is also associated with enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) from Zejula™ (niraparib) maintenance therapy. This assay is for professional use only and is to be performed only at 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108.

For more detailed information about Lynparza and its safety and efficacy please go to lynparza.com
For more detailed information about Zejula and its safety and efficacy please go to zejula.com

Lynparza is a trademark of the AstraZeneca group of companies, Zejula is a trademark of Tesaro, Inc.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Why OneOme’s RightMed® test?

Over 4 billion prescriptions are issued each year.1 However, not all drugs are effective for all people. In fact, response rates for many drugs are only between 50-75%.2 Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) account for up to 7% of all hospital admissions and up to 20% of re-admissions, according to estimates.3,4 ADRs are the fourth leading cause of death and are estimated to cost $136 billion annually.5 An estimated 10-20% of ADRs may be due to genetic factors.6
Healthcare providers like you may use pharmacogenomic information to make better prescription decisions.  
The OneOme RightMed pharmacogenomic test includes 22 actionable genes that cover more than 340 of the most commonly used drugs drugs across ONCOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY, and 28 OTHER DISEASE AREAS.

Pharmacogenomics — effectively integrated into patients’ everyday clinical care.







The OneOme RightMed® pharmacogenomic test

The OneOme RightMed test is a physician-ordered pharmacogenomic test that analyzes a patient’s DNA to determine how he or she may respond to certain medications. The analysis is provided to the physician in the form of a static and interactive report which clearly identifies which prescription drugs are — or aren’t — likely to work. This information can help providers make better prescription decisions, protect patients from adverse drug reactions and drug ineffectiveness, and reduce healthcare costs.

PROVIDER TOOLKIT PATIENT TOOLKIT






How people metabolize drugs 


Poor metabolizer (PM)
Metabolizes drugs much
more slowly than normal.  

Intermediate metabolizer (IM)
Metabolizes more
slowly than normal.  

Normal metabolizer (NM)
Metabolizes at a
normal rate.  

Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM)
Metabolizes more
quickly than normal.  


Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genes affect his or her response to medications, examines metabolization as a major factor contributing to an individual's response to drugs. Knowing how a patient will metabolize, or break down, many drugs will help physicians determine which drugs may work for their patients and reduce the trial-and-error approach.  
Depending on variations in a patient’s genes, that patient may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly. If the patient is a poor metabolizer of a given drug, he or she may be exposed to too much of it, which may result in an adverse drug reaction (ADR). If the patient is an ultrarapid metabolizer of a drug, he or she may not get enough to have any effect at all. Since genes don’t change with time, this patient will always be an ultrarapid metabolizer of that drug.  
Physicians can use this information to determine optimal drugs and doses for their patients.






Co-developed by Mayo Clinic, the RightMed test is:


COMPREHENSIVE: Rigorous, proprietary analysis that covers 22 GENES, 340+ COMMONLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS, and 28 CONDITIONS


INDIVIDUALIZED: Comprised of a patient’s genetic information, medication history, and drug-to-drug interactions


CREDIBLE: Co-developed and exclusively licensed with Mayo Clinic; characterized by SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DATA


ACTIONABLE: Provides enhanced static reports and interactive decision support tools for easy readability and quick decision-making within the provider workflow


ACCESSIBLE: Affordable — offered at a low-cost, out-of-pocket expense.

Testing for today and tomorrow 
OneOme brings clarity and insight into new and existing medications. OneOme’s RightMed PGx test may help with:


CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS (REACTIVELY): Physicians can get insight into why a patient might be experiencing adverse effects or is not experiencing the expected benefits from a drug they’re already taking


PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS (PROACTIVELY): Before prescribing a new medication, physicians can leverage a patient’s PGx profile to make more informed decisions



Because DNA does not change with time, the OneOme RightMed PGx test may provide years of more accurate decision-making.







 OneOme's process 

OneOme’s RightMed pharmacogenomic test analyzes a patient’s genetic information through our curated clinical PGx knowledgebase to provide information on the individual patient’s PGx profile. The actionable results are delivered to the provider through a variety of decision support tools.

Advancing pharmacy.
Helping optimize patient care.







Put pharmacogenomics to work
Pharmacists are uniquely qualified to help patients and healthcare teams utilize pharmacogenomics (PGx) by introducing and providing the OneOme RightMed® test. Covering 340+ DRUGS and 28 MEDICAL CONDITIONS, the test can help pharmacists guide optimal drug selection and dosing, much like recommending a dosing adjustment based on drug interaction or renal dysfunction. Pharmacists’ distinct education, skills, and expanding role in healthcare position them to champion processes for pharmacogenomic testing and interpretation of results – and with it, a new level of care.

Era of personalized medicine 
Trial-and-error as a prescription method can cause adverse drug reactions or inadequate patient response. This often can lead to therapeutic failures before the right drug and dosage are found.  
The approach to care is changing. Pharmacists are optimizing the paradigm of patient care by incorporating genomics into clinical decision making. This proactive approach advances pharmacy by improving patient care and personalizing drug therapies.
