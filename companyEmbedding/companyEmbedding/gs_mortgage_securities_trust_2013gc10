Fitch Affirms GSMS 2013-GC10 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms GSMS 2013-GC10
    





January 07, 2016 04:50 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Company's GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates, series 2013-GC10. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of GSMS 2013-GC10 are based on the stable performance 
      of the underlying collateral since issuance. As of the December 2015 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 6.1% to $807.3 million from $859.4 million at issuance. The 
      pool has experienced no realized losses to date. Per the servicer 
      reporting, there is currently one loan that is both delinquent and in 
      special servicing (0.5% of the pool) and two loans are fully defeased 
      (3% of the pool). Ten loans are considered Fitch Loans of Concern (12.4% 
      of the pool). Interest shortfalls are currently affecting the non-rated 
      class G.
    

      The specially serviced loan (0.5% of the pool) is secured by a 129,112 
      square foot (sf) neighborhood shopping center located in Eaton, OH. The 
      center is anchored by Kroger (20% net rentable area [NRA] through 
      February 2016) and Tractor Supply Company (33.1% NRA through October 
      2021). The loan transferred to special servicing on Nov. 4, 2015 for 
      imminent default due to continued noncompliance and unresponsiveness in 
      setting up the cash management account and remitting excess cash flow. 
      Per servicer correspondence, the lender is in discussions with the 
      borrower regarding setting up the cash management account and 
      reinstating the loan. Local counsel has been retained to file for 
      foreclosure and/or receivership, if necessary. Additionally, the loan is 
      30 days delinquent as of the December 2015 distribution date.
    

      The largest Fitch Loan of Concern (4.1% of the pool) is secured by an 
      182,181 sf mixed use property with retail and office space located in 
      downtown Portland, OR. The property is leased to CityTarget (48.7% NRA 
      through January 2029), Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts (43.8% 
      NRA through September 2018), and Brooks Brothers (6.4% NRA through 
      November 2017). According to third party news reports, Le Cordon Bleu 
      will be closing this location by the end of 2017, prior to the tenant's 
      2018 expiration. An update has been requested from the master servicer 
      regarding the rollover risk associated with Le Cordon Bleu. Year-end 
      (YE) 2014 occupancy and debt service coverage (DSCR) figures from the 
      servicer were not available as of the review date. As of the July 2015 
      rent roll, the property was 98.9% occupied.
    

      Since the prior review, one loan (2.7% of the original pool balance) has 
      been repaid. The loan, secured by a 353-key full service hotel in 
      downtown Raleigh, NC, was prepaid in July 2015 with a yield maintenance 
      penalty of approximately $1.8 million. The loan balance before 
      prepayment was $21.9 million.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks remain Stable for all classes due to stable 
      performance of the pool and continued paydown. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      Additional information on rating agency sensitivity is available in the 
      report 'GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-GC10' (May 21, 2013), 
      available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$1.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$35.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$34.4 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22.6 million class E at 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$16.1 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional amount and interest-only.
