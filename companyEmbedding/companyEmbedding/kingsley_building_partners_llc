Built for the long haul...
ergoPOWER™ Self Propelled Carts
Public, Academic & School Libraries  |  Warehouse  |  Distribution Centers


Strong and quiet electric motor with long-lasting gel batteries does all the work. You simply steer. Less stress and fatigue on your back and shoulders. Simple one person operation, even up ADA ramps, over thresholds, across carpeting, over asphalt, and through sand and snow. Field tested for over three years, the ergoPower has proven to be safe and reliable. Easy operation with intuitive controls, variable speed, and reverse. ErgoPower fits through all standard 36” wide doors and aisles. Fast 8 hr recharge with a one hour quick charger available, but it can last weeks on a single charge (depending on use). Anti roll-back on inclines, Electronic brake for quick stops. Automatically stops when the throttle is released. Keyed lock prevents unauthorized use. All this plus Kingsley’s auto-adjustable receiving tray that lowers as materials are deposited for less damage, and raises as removed for less bending and stooping. Easy unloading from a sitting position.

Enough said.

We work hard to be a company our employees and our customers can be proud of. For us, that means doing our best to support the many people and communities we serve. It also means respecting the environment by reducing our impact and conserving resources where we can. We strive to make people feel good and show that Kingsley® is a company that cares.

Our History
Since 1985, real estate leaders have turned to Kingsley Associates to maximize their portfolio and organizational performance. Our suite of customizable tools and industry benchmarks strengthens the relationships between real estate firms and their key stakeholders.





Steve Kingsley founded Kingsley Associates with the mission of helping real estate organizations enhance their performance through research, data analysis, and strategic consulting. Since the conception of the company, Kingsley Associates has been committed to serving the leaders of the industry with high quality deliverables and exceptional client service.
In response to the need for performance-based benchmarks, Kingsley Associates developed the Kingsley IndexSM, which is now the largest and most comprehensive database of customer satisfaction metrics available to the real estate industry. The Kingsley Index has been a fundamental instrument of the firm’s success for 30 years.
Kingsley Associates’ advanced processes and tools ensure research validity and data integrity while providing a user-friendly and streamlined experience.
