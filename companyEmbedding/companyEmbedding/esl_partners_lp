Decide Your Best-Fit Destination

Your personal Job Placement Advisor (JPA) will suggest destinations that fit your skill set and provide you with the information you need to decide which country is right for you based on your qualifications and interests.With the help of your JPA, you will develop a good understanding of potential ESL markets around the globe and where there is a high demand for ESL teachers.
Each country has its own minimum requirements to teach. As you narrow down your choices to a few select countries just remember that being open-minded will give you more options to choose from.

x
Create an Effective Resume

We assist you in developing an ESL-specific resume and cover letter. These are necessary for applying to any school overseas, and offer a crucial first impression of you. It is important to write a resume that shows employers why you are the best candidate for the position. As a course graduate, you will have access to our resume and cover letter creator tool to help ensure your application is tailored to the international ESL job market.

x
Prepare You To Ace Your Job Interviews


As you begin to hear back from schools and recruiters, your Job Placement Advisor will help you prepare for your upcoming interviews. Typically, interviews are conducted with a school’s director via telephone or over Skype.
The interview gives you the opportunity to prove you are a native or fluent English speaker and showcase the skills that make you right for the position. Practice before the interview so you have time to think about the types of answers you would like to give. See the tips listed below for a sample of the assistance your JPA will provide.

Speak clearly and avoid pausing.
Answer the questions within a few sentences without overloading the response with unnecessary details.
Be grammatically correct with your answers.
Keep a positive tone of voice throughout the interview.
When discussing previous experiences and/or education, use real-life examples.
Make it clear throughout the interview that you are excited about the prospect of teaching English abroad.
Be aware that you may be speaking with an ESL speaker and as such, choose simple and clear vocabulary.
For a Skype interview, ensure you are dressed professionally and present yourself in a positive manner: sit up straight, don’t fiddle with anything, and look the interviewer in the eye. Your Job Placement Advisor will give you additional interview tips and answer any questions you may have about this process.


Close











x
Negotiate And Sign Your Job Contract


Once interviews have been conducted, you will begin to receive job offers along with proposed contracts. As exciting as it is to receive a job offer, your Job Placement Advisor will be on hand to give you feedback and recommendations prior to signing your contract.
Proper time and effort must be spent reviewing a contract before it’s signed. Read over your contract thoroughly. Ask questions to ensure that you are clear on every aspect of the contract. If this is your first teaching position, make sure you know what the standard of pay is for that particular country.
Items to Consider:

Split shifts
Unpaid holidays
Sick days
Reimbursement of airfare
Overtime
Accommodations
Key money (mainly in Japan)
Transportation
Preparation Time
Extracurricular activities
Healthcare
Holidays
Transportation from airport when first arriving in the country

Be Realistic
It is important to keep in mind that you should only negotiate items on which you are not willing to compromise. If you appear too demanding, your application could be set aside in favor of another candidate.
