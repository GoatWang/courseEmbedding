Welcome

Back on February 5, 2008, my friend Steve and I started implu.  The idea was simple: take public financial data, strip out all the financial details, and use it to track executives.So we built a database and started developing a website. After a few weeks, it became clear that we wanted a subscription model and so we needed a sales person. On February 29, I introduced the concept to another friend, Graham, and he immediately came onboard. We spent March and April working on the product, officially launching the site on May 3.This blog will showcase implu data and allow folks to comment on it.  In addition, we'll keep users informed as we add new features to implu.- Corey.

Plantagenet



Richard II 
1377-99




The future King Richard II was born at the Archbishop's Palace, Bordeaux, Aquitaine, at epiphany, on 6th January, 
      1367. The product of a first cousin marriage, he was the son of Edward III's eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, the Black Prince and his 
      wife, Joan, Countess of Kent. Joan, known as the 'Fair Maid of Kent', was 
      the daughter of Edmund, Earl of Kent, the youngest of Edward I's sons by his second wife, Margaret of France. This 
      gave Richard a double descent from Edward I, due to previous cousin marriages in his family, his grandparents had also been first cousins, Richard was therefore a highly inbred individual.
His mother,  Joan of Kent, has been described as one of the most beautiful and scandalous women of her age. Unusual for the day, Richard's parent's 
      marriage was a genuine love match and not a political alliance.  Joan of Kent had  previously been married to Thomas Holland and through this former 
      marriage, Richard had half siblings. 
Joan  caused quite a scandal by entering into a clandestine marriage with Holland at the age of twelve. The following winter, while her husband was serving abroad, Joan married again to William Montacute, the Earl of Salisbury's heir. When Holland returned to England a few years later, he revealed his secret marriage to Joan and appealed to 
   Pope Clement VI for his wife's return, Joan supported his appeal. Salisbury resorted to keeping  her a prisoner in his home. The Pope annulled Joan's marriage to Montacute and ordered to return to Thomas Holland, with whom she lived for the next eleven years. The marriage produced four  children. 
Richard had an elder brother, Edward of Angouleme, who  had died in infancy of bubonic plague, leaving Richard his father's sole heir. Edward, the Black Prince predeceased  Edward III, 
      dying of dysentry in June, 1376. He  had obtained a promise from his father that Richard should succeed him. 
      After his grandfather's death, the ten year old Richard was duly crowned at Westminster Abbey on 16 July, 1377. 
His charismatic grandfather and martial father were a hard act to follow. Artistic and sensitive, Richard was a pacifist, not an attitude 
      to endear him to those of his barons who looked back to an heroic past.
Richard is the first English monarch for whom a contemporary painting survives. 
      He was built in the typical Plantagenet mould, around six feet tall, auburn haired and good-looking, with finely chiseled features and beautiful, long, 
      tapering hands. The chronicler Adam of Usk described him as being ' as beautiful 
      as Absalom.'  Richard was also volatile 
      and unstable, brooding and vengeful, and in him the famed Plantagenet temper boiled 
      into a frenzy. 
 A description by a Monk of Elvetham relates King Richard was of the common stature, his hair yellowish, his face fair and rosy, rather round than long, and sometimes flushed; abrupt and somewhat stammering in his speech, capricious in his manners, and too apt to prefer the recommendations of the young, to the advice of the elder, nobles. He was prodigal in his gifts, extravagantly splendid in his entertainment and dress, timid as to war, very passionate toward his domestics, haughty and too much devoted to voluptuousness. So fond of late hours, that he would sometimes sit up all night drinking."
The country was governed by Richard's uncle John of Gaunt and a council during his minority. In 1381, when Richard was fourteen, 
      the Peasants Revolt, probably the first socialist movement in English history, broke out in Kent due to simmering reentment of a highly unpopular poll tax. The rebels marched up to London, their  leaders, Watt Tyler, Jack Straw and 
      a priest, John Ball, demanded the abolition of serfdom and a pardon for 
      all participants in the uprising. Discontented recruits to the cause were 
      many and their army swelled to what is estimated at around ten thousand. 
All those connected with the hated poll tax were summarily executed on 
      the peasants progress to London. John Ball chose as his text :- "When 
      Adam delved (dug) and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?" The rebels were 
      welcomed by the majority of Londoners and the army camped at 
      Blackheath on 14th June, threatening London.
Watt Tyler met Richard and his terrified retinue at Mile End. The young 
      King's position was precarious and having little choice, he ordered  charters 
      drawn up granting all of Tyler's requests. A further meeting was arranged at Smithfield. 
      Tyler attended alone and repeated further demands. Richard wearily conceded to grant them all. Washing out his mouth with  water, Tyler proceeded to spit it out in the king's presence, at which 
      Walworth, the Mayor of London, incensed at what he saw as impertinence, 
      stabbed Tyler to death. The rebel army were unclear at what 
      was happening in the distance, seizing the initiative, Richard advanced alone, calling out loudly  "I am your King follow me." and 
      led the rebel army away. The revolt was put down with severity, the young 
      king, in a characteristic outburst of venom, wreaked a terrible vengeance and the heads of it's leaders were displayed 
      on pikes at London Bridge.
At fifteen, Richard married Anne of Bohemia in St. Stephen's Chapel at 
      Westminster Abbey. Anne was the daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles 
      IV, and the sister of King Wenceslas of Bohemia. The couple were to become devoted 
      to each other and the queen exercised a moderating influence on her husband but their union produced no issue. 






King Richard II, like Edward II before him, was unfortunately reckless in his generosity to favorites, Robert de 
      Vere, Earl of Oxford was raised to a Duke. Anger smouldered and came to a head in 1387 when Richard failed to bring certain of his favourites to trial, he was subjected to force. He was defeated by a rebel army led by his uncle, Thomas, Duke of Gloucester at Radcot Bridge in Oxfordshire, Gloucester had been joined by John of Gaunt's son, Henry of Bolingbroke. At the 'Merciless Parliament' 
      of 1388, the Lords Appellant demanded radical changes in the royal household, the execution of the king's principal supporters and de Vere's estates confiscated. 
      The House of Commons feared the King's attempts to undermine the authority of parliament and he was placed under the control of a council. Their intransigence 
      fueled a smouldering desire for revenge in the unstable Richard.
Richard  delighted in lavish dress and extravagant 
      jewels. He is popularly credited with introducing the use of the pocket 
      handkerchief. In common with his ancestor Henry III, he venerated the memory 
      of the Saxon King, Edward the Confessor and adopted his coat of arms, which 
      were quartered with his own.
Tragically, his beloved Queen, Anne, died of the plague in 1394, aged but twenty-eight.  Richard's grief was terrible, distraught and emotionally unstabilized, he 
      had Sheen Palace, where Anne had died, razed to the ground. The Queen was buried at Westminster near to St. Edward's shrine. An embarrassing 
      incident marred the funeral service, Richard was angered by Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, who had the audacity to arrive late. When he tactlessly 
      asked the King to excuse his attendance, Richard completely lost control. In his passionate grief and fury he seized a wand from one of 
      the vergers and struck Arundel so violently about the head with it that he fell to the ground dazed.
Richard's mental state has long been an issue of historical debate the Victorian historian Bishop Stubbs has stated that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind "was losing its balance altogether". Historian Anthony Steel, who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that the king suffered from schizophrenia. This opinion was challenged by V.H. Galbraith, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, like Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck. Nigel Saul, who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes that - even though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illness - he showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality, and towards the end of his reign "Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker".
Two years ater Anne's death, Richard married again, taking Isabella of Valois, the six year 
      old daughter of Charles VI of France, as his second wife. Richard treated 
      her with great kindness and  they were to become extremely fond of each other.
Richard's brooding on past slights culminated with his taking action with ruthless suddeness in 1397. His old opponents were placed under arrest and his uncle, Thomas Duke of Gloucester, was murdered. He exiled his cousin, 
      Henry Bolingbroke, who was one of the five Lords Appellant, in 1399.  On John of Gaunt's death, the following year, Richard 
      disinherited Henry and confiscated the vast Lancastrian estates.
 Henry reacted by invading England, landing at Ravenspur in Yorkshire, on the pretext of recovering his estates, but in reality 
      he intended to seize his cousin's throne. Richard, in Ireland at the time, sailed to Wales. The King met Henry's representatives 
      at Conway Castle and was informed that if he restored Henry's estates and 
      surrendered certain councillors for trial, he could remain in power. He agreed but was betrayed and instead of being returned to power found himself 
      the inhabitant of a dungeon  in the Tower.






A Parliament was called at the end of September, at which Henry claimed the throne. Richard was declared a tyrant and deposed. He was taken up 
      to Pontefract Castle, in Yorkshire and there it is certain, he met his end around the second week in February, 1400. Although Henry of Lancaster may have been prepared to let Richard  live, the situation changed when it was discovered that the earls of Huntingdon, Kent and Salisbury and Lord Despenser, and possibly also the Earl of Rutland, were planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the Epiphany Rising. Although averted, the plot highlighted the danger to Henry of allowing Richard to live.  His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in the old St Paul's Cathedral on 17 February before burial in Kings Langley Church on 6 March.His skeleton was examined in 1871 
      by Dean Stanley of Westminster but showed no marks of violence. Starvation was the most likely cause, although this has never been proven.
 After being displayed at St. Paul's, Richard's body was buried in King's Langley Church, Hertfordshire. His child 
      queen, Isabelle of France, mourned him deeply and sincerely. Henry IV wished 
      to make an alliance between herself and his eldest son, Henry, now Prince 
      of Wales, but loyal to the memory of her husband, she was inflexible in 
      refusing to even contemplate it. Isabelle was eventually returned to her father in France. She 
      was married to Charles of Angouleme and tragically died in childbirth.
Richard II's body was later moved to Westminster Abbey by Bolingbroke's successor, Henry 
      V, who had been close to him in his boyhood, there it was reburied beside 
      his beloved first wife, Anne of Bohemia. The tomb was opened in 1871 during restoration work to the abbey.  There were no marks of violence on Richard's skull and even some of the teeth were   preserved.   A staff, sceptre, part of the ball, two pairs of royal   gloves, and fragments of their peaked shoes still remained. A number of relics which seem to have taken from the tomb opening in 1871, were recently discovered in   a cigarette box in the basement of the National Portrait Gallery.    The contents of the box, dated 31 August 1871, included fragments of   wood, some fabric, and a piece of   leather from one of the  gloves.

Marathon's Croxall cancels 80,000 options as stock remains well below conversion price - The Patent Investor

Marathon’s Croxall cancels 80,000 options as stock remains well below conversion price

Marathon Patent Group (MARA) CEO Doug Croxall returned 80,000 of the 300,000 options he was given in November 2014 for cancellation because shares of the patent licensing company are trading at a fraction of the conversion price.
The transaction involving the cancelled options occurred on Oct. 13. The conversion price of the options, which expire Nov. 3, 2024 was $12.80. Shares of Marathon closed today at $2.36. They’ve traded between $1.29 and $3.44 over the past year. They touched a 5-year high of $9.18 on Dec. 15, 2014.
Croxall declined to comment.
He is cancelling options at a time when Marathon is having its best year ever. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles company said it expected revenue in 2016 to exceed $40 million.
The company has announced several significant licensing settlements recently including a $24.5 million settlement its Dynamic Advances and partner Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute reached with Apple Inc. Other recent settlements with Titanium2Bone and DFine have involved Marathon’s Orthophoenix unit, which also has now settled pending litigation with Stryker Corp. and Wright Medical Technology Inc.
The company’s Signal IP unit which sued a number of car manufacturers for infringement also has reached settlements with 10 car makers. It still has pending enforcement actions against Fiat Chrysler, Kia, Hyundai and Nissan.
In other news, Richard Molineaux Tyler III, and Edward Kovalik, both Marathon directors, each received 20,000 options to purchase Marathon shares at $2.41 each. The transactions also occurred on Oct. 13. The options vest pro rata on a monthly basis over 12 months beginning Oct. 14 and expire on Oct. 13, 2021.
