          Landmark Federal Ruling Represents Game Changer for Accessibility Advocates: Inaccessible Websites Violate Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act

TUCSON, Ariz., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- AudioEye, Inc. (OTCQB: AEYE) ("AudioEye" or the "Company") today announced that it has secured new cash contracts with two leading brands across two emerging target market verticals, Consumer Media & Healthcare.








"AudioEye continues to grow our customer base in not only our five target verticals, but also in two new verticals with recent enterprise reference account wins as a growing number of companies proactively seek out time- and cost-efficient digital accessibility solutions," said Todd Bankofier, AudioEye Chief Executive Officer. "The increasing momentum for our highly-documented subscription solutions reflect not only the strong business case for maximizing the user audience our customers can reach, but also due to increasing recognition of legal and compliance requirements for digital content." 
In June, a federal judge in Florida issued a landmark ruling that Winn-Dixie, an operator of more than 500 grocery stores in the southeast United States, violated Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act when it failed to make its website accessible. This lawsuit, filed by a blind plaintiff, culminated in a first-of-its-kind federal ruling, as opposed to a settlement. This newly established legal precedent has been hailed as a major victory by Accessibility advocates.
The first of two new cash contracts awarded was the result of an extensive and detailed vendor selection process by one of the largest U.S. providers of TV, Internet, and Digital Services, who selected AudioEye for a multi-year engagement to provide Accessibility Testing and Support Services. Additionally, AudioEye was recently awarded a cash contract with one of the ten largest health insurance providers in the U.S. 
"After an extensive search, our new consumer media customer selected AudioEye for our superior technology supported by a team of accessibility professionals that will assist them in their efforts to incorporate accessibility testing into their incumbent processes," stated Sean Bradley, AudioEye Chief Technology Officer. "As one of the largest media companies in the world, our client will be leveraging AudioEye tools to empower designers, developers, and accessibility stakeholders in their continued effort to prioritize digital accessibility in their many projects and online initiatives."
"Our new health insurance customer took a different approach to selecting an accessibility vendor by benchmarking one tool against another," stated Mr. Bradley. "Through an exhaustive analysis of our technology solutions, our new customer opted for the most technically advanced, yet cost-effective solution that will save accessibility project owners time and money as they look to ensure accessibility and inclusion when publishing and maintaining digital content."
Both of these agreements were secured in partnership with Bender Consulting Services, Inc. AudioEye previously announced the partnership in 2016 and the collaboration continues to prove effective. 
"At Bender, we pride ourselves on delivering the highest quality solutions for our customers and, with AudioEye, we've approached our clients with confidence and conviction in our ability to deliver on this promise, which continues to resonate with our valued clients," stated Mary Brougher, Executive Vice President of Business Operations at Bender Consulting Services, Inc.
About AudioEye, Inc. AudioEye's software enables every enterprise, from corporations to government agencies, to make their content more consumable through technology. 
More accessible. More usable. More people.
