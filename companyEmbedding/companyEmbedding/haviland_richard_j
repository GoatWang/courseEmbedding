Richard J Haviland's Experience
Title: President
               Company: New London Kiwanis
Job Details
               Kiwanis International, founded in Detroit, Michigan, was celebrating its 25th anniversary when a group of business and professional men from New London established the local club. The Kiwanis doctrine of service to the community and fellowship among men of good will appealed to the group; and so began a 60 year passage through all of the trauma and dramatic change of the 20th century. Dick Pugh, later to become club president and division Lieutenant Governor, was host to the founding group in his office at the head of State Street across from the courthouse and next to the Garde Theater. There the organization foundation was laid, and on December 2, 1940 the charter was presented to the Rev. Frank S. Morehouse, the first of some sixty presidents, in elaborate ceremonies at the Lighthouse Inn. Dick Pugh's beach house on Pequot Avenue, incidentally, was to become the venue of the club picnic, a social highlight for several generations of Kiwanians. The Nazi war machine was already churning inexorably through Europe, and the United States' subsequent entrance into the conflict was to dictate the activities of the club for the next decade. Some members went off to war; those staying behind organized projects to assist the war effort; selling war bonds, raising funds to assist families separated by war, volunteering for duty as air raid wardens (made all the more urgent because of New London's strategic importance).
