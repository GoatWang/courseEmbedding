History[edit]
The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014.
In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion.
Technology[edit]
WANdisco's Distributed Coordination Engine (DConE) is the shared component for WANdisco clustering products.[3] The DConE system allows multiple instances of the same application to operate on independent hardware without sharing any resources. All of the application servers are kept in synchronisation by DConE regardless of whether the servers are on the same LAN or globally separated and accessible only over a wide area network (WAN).
WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework.[4] Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added significant innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments.
WANdisco provides replicated products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition support, consultancy and training services are offered.
The company's website lists companies such as AT&T, APC, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Thales Group, Verisign, Sun Microsystems, Honda, NTT, Intel, John Deere, Disney, Symantec, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Motorola.[5]
IBM OEM[edit]
In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion.[6] The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as "IBM Big Replicate" and plays an important role in IBMs Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud [7]
Defunct products[edit]
In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features.[8] The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013.[9]
Open source contributions[edit]
In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley.[10]
Hadoop[edit]
WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco.[11]
Subversion[edit]
WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008[12] through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time.[13]
Server and client binaries[edit]
WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website.[14] These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution.
Project announcements[edit]
In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project,[15] specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality.
The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features.[16] According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time.[12][17] David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community[18] and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.[19]

History[edit]
The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014.
In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion.
Technology[edit]
WANdisco's Distributed Coordination Engine (DConE) is the shared component for WANdisco clustering products.[3] The DConE system allows multiple instances of the same application to operate on independent hardware without sharing any resources. All of the application servers are kept in synchronisation by DConE regardless of whether the servers are on the same LAN or globally separated and accessible only over a wide area network (WAN).
WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework.[4] Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added significant innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments.
WANdisco provides replicated products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition support, consultancy and training services are offered.
The company's website lists companies such as AT&T, APC, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Thales Group, Verisign, Sun Microsystems, Honda, NTT, Intel, John Deere, Disney, Symantec, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Motorola.[5]
IBM OEM[edit]
In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion.[6] The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as "IBM Big Replicate" and plays an important role in IBMs Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud [7]
Defunct products[edit]
In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features.[8] The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013.[9]
Open source contributions[edit]
In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley.[10]
Hadoop[edit]
WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco.[11]
Subversion[edit]
WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008[12] through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time.[13]
Server and client binaries[edit]
WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website.[14] These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution.
Project announcements[edit]
In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project,[15] specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality.
The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features.[16] According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time.[12][17] David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community[18] and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.[19]

WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework.[4] Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added significant innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments.
WANdisco provides replicated products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition support, consultancy and training services are offered.
The company's website lists companies such as AT&T, APC, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Thales Group, Verisign, Sun Microsystems, Honda, NTT, Intel, John Deere, Disney, Symantec, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Motorola.[5]
IBM OEM[edit]
In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion.[6] The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as "IBM Big Replicate" and plays an important role in IBMs Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud [7]
Defunct products[edit]
In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features.[8] The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013.[9]
Open source contributions[edit]
In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley.[10]
Hadoop[edit]
WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco.[11]
Subversion[edit]
WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008[12] through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time.[13]
Server and client binaries[edit]
WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website.[14] These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution.
Project announcements[edit]
In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project,[15] specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality.
The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features.[16] According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time.[12][17] David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community[18] and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.[19]

History[edit]
The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014.
In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion.

History[edit]
The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014.
In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion.
Technology[edit]
WANdisco's Distributed Coordination Engine (DConE) is the shared component for WANdisco clustering products.[3] The DConE system allows multiple instances of the same application to operate on independent hardware without sharing any resources. All of the application servers are kept in synchronisation by DConE regardless of whether the servers are on the same LAN or globally separated and accessible only over a wide area network (WAN).
WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework.[4] Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added significant innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments.
WANdisco provides replicated products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition support, consultancy and training services are offered.
The company's website lists companies such as AT&T, APC, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Thales Group, Verisign, Sun Microsystems, Honda, NTT, Intel, John Deere, Disney, Symantec, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Motorola.[5]
IBM OEM[edit]
In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion.[6] The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as "IBM Big Replicate" and plays an important role in IBMs Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud [7]
Defunct products[edit]
In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features.[8] The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013.[9]
Open source contributions[edit]
In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley.[10]
Hadoop[edit]
WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco.[11]
Subversion[edit]
WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008[12] through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time.[13]
Server and client binaries[edit]
WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website.[14] These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution.
Project announcements[edit]
In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project,[15] specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality.
The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features.[16] According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time.[12][17] David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community[18] and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.[19]

History[edit]
The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014.
In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion.
Technology[edit]
WANdisco's Distributed Coordination Engine (DConE) is the shared component for WANdisco clustering products.[3] The DConE system allows multiple instances of the same application to operate on independent hardware without sharing any resources. All of the application servers are kept in synchronisation by DConE regardless of whether the servers are on the same LAN or globally separated and accessible only over a wide area network (WAN).
WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework.[4] Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added significant innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments.
WANdisco provides replicated products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition support, consultancy and training services are offered.
The company's website lists companies such as AT&T, APC, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Thales Group, Verisign, Sun Microsystems, Honda, NTT, Intel, John Deere, Disney, Symantec, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Motorola.[5]
IBM OEM[edit]
In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion.[6] The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as "IBM Big Replicate" and plays an important role in IBMs Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud [7]
Defunct products[edit]
In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features.[8] The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013.[9]
Open source contributions[edit]
In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley.[10]
Hadoop[edit]
WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco.[11]
Subversion[edit]
WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008[12] through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time.[13]
Server and client binaries[edit]
WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website.[14] These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution.
Project announcements[edit]
In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project,[15] specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality.
The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features.[16] According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time.[12][17] David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community[18] and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.[19]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

History[edit]
The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide area network distributed computing. Initially offering a replication solution for distributed teams using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), this was expanded to include Apache Subversion with SVN MultiSite Plus in 2006, Git with Git MultiSite in 2013 and Gerrit with Gerrit MultiSite in 2014.
In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor, and entered the Big Data market with its Non-Stop Hadoop product. AltoStor's founders, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko and Jagane Sundar, joined WANdisco as part of the acquisition, and helped develop the company's next generation Hadoop product released in 2015, WANdisco Fusion.
Technology[edit]
WANdisco's Distributed Coordination Engine (DConE) is the shared component for WANdisco clustering products.[3] The DConE system allows multiple instances of the same application to operate on independent hardware without sharing any resources. All of the application servers are kept in synchronisation by DConE regardless of whether the servers are on the same LAN or globally separated and accessible only over a wide area network (WAN).
WANdisco's replication technology was the work of Yeturu Aahlad who had previously worked for Sun, Netscape and IBM and was involved in developing the CORBA Framework.[4] Aahlad theorized a model for effective Active replication over a WAN. In the development of DConE, WANdisco has taken the Paxos algorithm as a baseline and added significant innovations relevant to mission-critical, high transaction volume distributed environments.
WANdisco provides replicated products for CVS, Apache Subversion, Git, Gerrit, Apache Hadoop, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. In addition support, consultancy and training services are offered.
The company's website lists companies such as AT&T, APC, Avaya, Bally Technologies, Thales Group, Verisign, Sun Microsystems, Honda, NTT, Intel, John Deere, Disney, Symantec, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and Motorola.[5]
IBM OEM[edit]
In April 2016, WANdisco announced that IBM had signed a deal to OEM WANdisco Fusion.[6] The deal allows IBM to rebrand Fusion as "IBM Big Replicate" and plays an important role in IBMs Big Data and Cloud Computing strategy including movement of data between on-premises software and Cloud [7]
Defunct products[edit]
In 2011 WANdisco announced uberSVN, a deployment of Apache Subversion which included a web based management console and the ability to add additional application lifecycle management features.[8] The uberSVN download was available through mid-2013.[9]
Open source contributions[edit]
In September 2013 WANdisco announced it is an official sponsor of the UC Berkeley AMPLab, a five-year collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley.[10]
Hadoop[edit]
WANdisco has one Apache Hadoop committer on staff: Jagane Sundar. In February 2013 WANdisco released a free distribution of Hadoop containing additional components developed by WANdisco.[11]
Subversion[edit]
WANdisco was involved in the Apache Subversion open source project from 2008[12] through 2015. They employed several contributors to work on the Subversion project during that time.[13]
Server and client binaries[edit]
WANdisco provides Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website.[14] These binaries use the default package management system for each Linux distribution.
Project announcements[edit]
In December 2010, WANdisco announced its intention to develop some features for the Subversion project,[15] specifically aimed at improving branching and merging functionality.
The Apache Foundation and some Subversion developers said the announcement contained unfounded claims and insinuations about community involvement and the lack of development on these features.[16] According to Apache, these features were already being worked on at the time.[12][17] David Richards from WANdisco clarified this position to the Subversion community[18] and followed up by announcing WANdisco's sponsorship and ongoing support for the work of the Apache Software Foundation.[19]

3 July 2017


WANdisco plc


('WANdisco' or the 'Company')


CUSTOMER WIN


WANdisco secures first contract in Healthcare sector


WANdisco (LSE: WAND), the world leader in Active Data Replication™, is pleased to announce it has secured a new contract with a major American healthcare corporation serving 50 million Americans in all 50 states (the 'Client') for the deployment of WANdisco Fusion® ('Fusion'), the Company's patented Big Data and Cloud product. The contract was secured directly by WANdisco on a 3 year subscription licence agreement.


The Client plans to deploy business-critical strategic patient data across a new Big Data/Cloud infrastructure which has stringent requirements around continuous availability of the applications and data. Fusion was therefore selected as it was the only enterprise-level solution that could transfer the large volumes of continuously changing critical patient data generated by the Client to the Cloud without impacting its availability and consistency.  


David Richards, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of WANdisco, commented:


'We are delighted to have secured our first customer in the healthcare sector, a large and highly prized target market for our business. We already have agreements with customers in the automotive, government, retail and finance sectors - and we believe the demand for Fusion doesn't stop there.


'What is also particularly pleasing is that to secure a contract with a healthcare business, where downtime and disruption to critical patient data is not an option, is further validation of not only our technology, but also our ability to manage unprecedented volumes of active, transactional data.'

WANdisco Plc
Directorate Change

RNS Number : 2035L WANdisco Plc 29 September 2016  

 
RNS
 
The following amendment has been made to the announcement released on 29 September 2016 at 10.30am under RNS number 2024L.
 
29 September 2016
 
 
WANdisco plc
("WANdisco" or the "Company")
 
Directorate Change
 
The Board of WANdisco (LSE: WAND) today announces that David Richards, Chief Executive Officer, will be stepping down from the Board and his role as CEO of the Company with immediate effect. A search for his replacement has commenced. In the interim period, Paul Walker, Non-Executive Chairman, has assumed the role of Executive Chairman with immediate effect.
 
The Board can confirm that WANdisco continues to trade in line with the expectations referenced at the time of the Company's Interim Results in August. There is a good pipeline of bookings and cash costs continue to decline, which combined with the new equity funding secured in June have enabled WANdisco to remain on a path toward cash flow break-even.
 
 
Paul Walker, Executive Chairman of WANdisco commented:
 
"Having co-founded WANdisco in 2005, David has been instrumental to the Company's progress to date.  We have a strong product, perfectly adapted to meet today's Big Data challenges and we are able to take that product to customers globally, using the international software business David has helped to build as a platform. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank David for his contribution over the years and wish him well for the future." 
 
David Richards commented:
 
"WANdisco has been my focus since 2005.  The business is now at an appropriate juncture, place and scale for a new person to take on the CEO role and drive the Company to its next level of achievement.  I wish all of the WANdisco team well as they push forward with the exciting opportunity ahead."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.
