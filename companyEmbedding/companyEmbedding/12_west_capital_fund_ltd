12 West Capital Launches $62M Hedge Fund
Jan 9 2014  |  4:13pm ET

Joel Ramin's New York-based 12 West Capital has raised over $62 million for a new hedge fund.
Assets raised for the 12 West Punch Card fund include subscriptions in-kind, according to regulatory filings.
Ramin serves as managing member and portfolio manager at 12 West Capital Management which he founded in 2011 after leaving Roberto Mignone's Bridger Capital, where he'd worked as an analyst. Prior to that, he'd worked at the Blackstone Group in the private equity division, performing fundamental research. 
James Gilmore is 12 West's chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, having previously held both positions at CAVU Capital Advisors, a fundamental equity long/short hedge fund shop. 
Ramin's firm, with $882 million in assets under management, runs the 12 West Capital Offshore Fund and the 12 West Capital Fund which participate in investments on a side-by-side basis, principally in equity, equity-related and credit securities traded globally.
12 West targets small-cap (under $2.5 billion) companies believing they represent “the greatest opportunity set to generate superior compounded annual returns” as few “high quality investment managers” invest in them, they are the subject of “significantly less investment research coverage” and “many small cap investors do not have the financial or other resources to properly evaluate and analyze small cap companies,” according to regulatory filings.
12 West seeks to capitalize on short-term inefficiencies in the small-cap market, utilizing “a myriad of creative research techniques, experience, judgment, flexibility, patience and financial resources.”
A call to 12 West Capital for further information about the new fund was not returned.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

 12 WEST CAPITAL Investment Strategy


				
					   Methods of Analysis, Investment Strategies and Risk of Loss In managing the Funds, we invest both long and short, in equity, equity related, and credit securities.
