How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.
