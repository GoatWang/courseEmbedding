Early life[edit]
McMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee,[1] and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas.[3] He was the oldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam.[4] His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16.[4] A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team.[4]
Career[edit]
McMillon has worked for Walmart throughout his career.[5] He took on his first role with the company as a teenager in 1984.[4][5] He later became a buyer, then moved into management roles before becoming CEO in 2014.[3][5]
Early career[edit]
When he was a teenager, McMillon began his first job with Walmart as a summer associate. He worked during the summer[4] unloading trucks in a distribution center.[6] After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[7] The next year, as McMillon studied for a master of business administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies.[4] Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store.[4] After completing his MBA in 1991,[7] McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer-training program.[8][9] Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle,[4] he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings.[10] He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics and sporting goods, among other areas.[10]
Sam's Club (2005–2009)[edit]
Walmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[8][11] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what The Wall Street Journal called "treasure hunt" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]
Walmart International (2009–2013)[edit]
Walmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[12] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.[10] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[13] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's "everyday low prices" model to these international markets.[13] Also under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4 billion.[4][14]
During McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart U.S.[15] and grew to 29 percent of total sales companywide.[10] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[16] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[17][not in citation given]
CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2014–present)[edit]
Walmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors,[18] and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth-ever chief executive.[4]
McMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the U.S., boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon stated that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[19] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[20]
In February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7 billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[21][22] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4 million U.S. workers.[23] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[19]
McMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a "seamless shopping experience".[24] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1 billion on its online operations.[25] Another goal of McMillon's is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[26] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the U.S., UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[27] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[28]
As CEO, McMillon sought to make a "positive difference" in other issues.[26] On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's "religious freedom" bill.[29] McMillon said the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold".[29] In June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[22] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[30] McMillon also altered Walmart's gun sales. He told CNNMoney in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[31] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[31]
Forbes named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No. 29, No. 32, No. 27 respectively.[32] ExecRank ranked McMillon No. 4 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies.[33]
In December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[34]
Personal life[edit]
McMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas.[20] They have two sons.[7]

Early life[edit]
McMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee,[1] and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas.[3] He was the oldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam.[4] His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16.[4] A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team.[4]
Career[edit]
McMillon has worked for Walmart throughout his career.[5] He took on his first role with the company as a teenager in 1984.[4][5] He later became a buyer, then moved into management roles before becoming CEO in 2014.[3][5]
Early career[edit]
When he was a teenager, McMillon began his first job with Walmart as a summer associate. He worked during the summer[4] unloading trucks in a distribution center.[6] After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[7] The next year, as McMillon studied for a master of business administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies.[4] Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store.[4] After completing his MBA in 1991,[7] McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer-training program.[8][9] Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle,[4] he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings.[10] He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics and sporting goods, among other areas.[10]
Sam's Club (2005–2009)[edit]
Walmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[8][11] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what The Wall Street Journal called "treasure hunt" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]
Walmart International (2009–2013)[edit]
Walmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[12] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.[10] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[13] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's "everyday low prices" model to these international markets.[13] Also under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4 billion.[4][14]
During McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart U.S.[15] and grew to 29 percent of total sales companywide.[10] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[16] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[17][not in citation given]
CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2014–present)[edit]
Walmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors,[18] and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth-ever chief executive.[4]
McMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the U.S., boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon stated that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[19] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[20]
In February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7 billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[21][22] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4 million U.S. workers.[23] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[19]
McMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a "seamless shopping experience".[24] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1 billion on its online operations.[25] Another goal of McMillon's is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[26] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the U.S., UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[27] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[28]
As CEO, McMillon sought to make a "positive difference" in other issues.[26] On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's "religious freedom" bill.[29] McMillon said the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold".[29] In June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[22] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[30] McMillon also altered Walmart's gun sales. He told CNNMoney in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[31] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[31]
Forbes named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No. 29, No. 32, No. 27 respectively.[32] ExecRank ranked McMillon No. 4 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies.[33]
In December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[34]
Personal life[edit]
McMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas.[20] They have two sons.[7]

Early life[edit]
McMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee,[1] and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas.[3] He was the oldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam.[4] His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16.[4] A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team.[4]
Career[edit]
McMillon has worked for Walmart throughout his career.[5] He took on his first role with the company as a teenager in 1984.[4][5] He later became a buyer, then moved into management roles before becoming CEO in 2014.[3][5]
Early career[edit]
When he was a teenager, McMillon began his first job with Walmart as a summer associate. He worked during the summer[4] unloading trucks in a distribution center.[6] After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[7] The next year, as McMillon studied for a master of business administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies.[4] Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store.[4] After completing his MBA in 1991,[7] McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer-training program.[8][9] Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle,[4] he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings.[10] He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics and sporting goods, among other areas.[10]
Sam's Club (2005–2009)[edit]
Walmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[8][11] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what The Wall Street Journal called "treasure hunt" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]
Walmart International (2009–2013)[edit]
Walmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[12] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.[10] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[13] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's "everyday low prices" model to these international markets.[13] Also under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4 billion.[4][14]
During McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart U.S.[15] and grew to 29 percent of total sales companywide.[10] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[16] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[17][not in citation given]
CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2014–present)[edit]
Walmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors,[18] and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth-ever chief executive.[4]
McMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the U.S., boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon stated that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[19] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[20]
In February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7 billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[21][22] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4 million U.S. workers.[23] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[19]
McMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a "seamless shopping experience".[24] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1 billion on its online operations.[25] Another goal of McMillon's is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[26] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the U.S., UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[27] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[28]
As CEO, McMillon sought to make a "positive difference" in other issues.[26] On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's "religious freedom" bill.[29] McMillon said the bill "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold".[29] In June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[22] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[30] McMillon also altered Walmart's gun sales. He told CNNMoney in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[31] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[31]
Forbes named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No. 29, No. 32, No. 27 respectively.[32] ExecRank ranked McMillon No. 4 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies.[33]
In December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[34]
Personal life[edit]
McMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas.[20] They have two sons.[7]

As
CEO, Doug leads a strong management team that is working to deliver Walmart’s

where customers around the world are heading next.Doug has served on the board of directors for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., since 2013 and currently is the chair of the Executive and Global Compensation committees.

Petition ClosedPetitioning  C. Douglas McMillonDecision makersC. Douglas McMillonWal-Mart CEO C. Douglas McMillon, Please Stop The Yulin Dog Meat FestivalLisa Bennett Chicago, ILLisa BennettChicago, IL2,226SupportersAt 405 BILLION dollars in sales of goods largely from China, Wal-Mart's CEO, C. Douglas McMillon has the power to influence the Chinese government to shut down the Yulin dog meat festival. In the dog and cat meat trade, most of the animals are stolen from their families or picked up as strays and shipped to illegal slaughterhouses that torture them mercilessly. The dogs and cats endure immense suffering until their last breath.  Furthermore, dog and cat meat makes people sick by spreading E. coli, salmonella, cholera and rabies. The industry is a hazard to animals and people, and must be stopped. 
Please Douglas McMillon, you are the most powerful retail CEO in the U.S., you can end the torture.This petition was delivered to:C. Douglas McMillonRead the letterLetter toC.
