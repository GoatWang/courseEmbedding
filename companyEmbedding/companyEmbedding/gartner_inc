Vendor Briefings

A vendor briefing is a research tool for industry analysts, and an opportunity for IT vendors to present its products, services and business strategies. During a briefing, the flow of information predominates from vendor to analysts and is not interactive. Gartner analysts schedule briefings at their discretion and not because of any fee or contractual relationship.

Top Strategic Predictions for 2017 and Beyond: Surviving the Storm Winds of Digital Disruption


 By 2018, more than 3 million workers globally will be supervised by a "roboboss."
Robobosses will increasingly make decisions that previously could only have been made by human managers. For example, they will route work and evaluate performance with nuance and flexibility (they will not, however, manage out-of-workflow exceptions, such as the need for compassionate leave, in the foreseeable future). Download the research or watch the webinar for an overview of trends and predictions. Or contact Gartner and become a client for the full Trends and Predictions portfolio.

Gartner Predicts Big Change for Digital Business: Will You Be Ready?







Areas of Focus



The emergence of Digital Business has sparked a shift in the relationship between man and machine. Throughout the year Gartner will focus on three categories that will highlight the idea of human-machine cooperation and growth:
Machines Are Taking a More-Active Role in Enhancing Human Endeavors:
Because the machines are more connected than ever before, they have an increased ability to supplement human jobs and to reduce the cost of operations.
Digitalized Things Are Making Assisted Economic Decisions:
The increased use of computing machines in decision making is extending into the realm of financial choices with increasing consistency. This makes one begin to think about how many of the economic decisions we make will be supported by, then automated through, digital technologies.
Renovating the Customer Experience Is a Digital Priority:
The practical digital business sees customer experience innovation as the next frontier, and half of all consumer goods product investments are likely to be directed toward improving the customer experience








“
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
By 2017, a significant and disruptive digital business will be launched that was conceived by a computer algorithm.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1979 by Gideon Gartner. Originally a private company, the Gartner Group was launched publicly the first time in the 1980s, then acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi, a London-based advertising agency, and then acquired in 1990 by some of its executives, with funding from Bain Capital and Dun & Bradstreet.[10] The company went public again in 1993.[11] In 2000 the name was simplified to Gartner.[12]
Gene Hall has been the CEO of the company since August 2004.
In the course of its growth, Gartner has acquired numerous companies providing related services, including Real Decisions—which became Gartner Measurement, now part of Gartner's consulting division—and Gartner Dataquest, a market research firm. It has also acquired a number of direct competitors, including NewScience in the late 1990s, Meta Group in 2005, AMR Research and Burton Group in early 2010, and Ideas International in 2012.
In March 2014 Gartner announced that it had acquired the privately held company Software Advice for an undisclosed amount.[13]
In July 2015, Gartner acquired Nubera, the business app discovery network that owns properties like GetApp, AppStorm, AppAppeal or CloudWork. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.[14] In September 2015 it acquired the privately held company Capterra.[15]
In June 2016 Gartner announced that it had acquired the privately held company SCM World, headquartered in London, U.K.[16]
On January 5, 2017 Gartner announced it had reached an agreement to acquire CEB, Inc. in a cash and stock deal worth about US$2.6 billion.[17][18]
Controversy[edit]
Gartner has had a major controversy in forecasts. In 2009, Gartner predicted the PC market would experience the "sharpest unit decline in history", and a few quarters later it reported "strongest growth rate in seven years".[19] The Actual Shipment Decline started the year 2010.[20], reaching peak decline in 2016[21]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1979 by Gideon Gartner. Originally a private company, the Gartner Group was launched publicly the first time in the 1980s, then acquired by Saatchi & Saatchi, a London-based advertising agency, and then acquired in 1990 by some of its executives, with funding from Bain Capital and Dun & Bradstreet.[10] The company went public again in 1993.[11] In 2000 the name was simplified to Gartner.[12]
Gene Hall has been the CEO of the company since August 2004.
In the course of its growth, Gartner has acquired numerous companies providing related services, including Real Decisions—which became Gartner Measurement, now part of Gartner's consulting division—and Gartner Dataquest, a market research firm. It has also acquired a number of direct competitors, including NewScience in the late 1990s, Meta Group in 2005, AMR Research and Burton Group in early 2010, and Ideas International in 2012.
In March 2014 Gartner announced that it had acquired the privately held company Software Advice for an undisclosed amount.[13]
In July 2015, Gartner acquired Nubera, the business app discovery network that owns properties like GetApp, AppStorm, AppAppeal or CloudWork. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.[14] In September 2015 it acquired the privately held company Capterra.[15]
In June 2016 Gartner announced that it had acquired the privately held company SCM World, headquartered in London, U.K.[16]
On January 5, 2017 Gartner announced it had reached an agreement to acquire CEB, Inc. in a cash and stock deal worth about US$2.6 billion.[17][18]
Controversy[edit]
Gartner has had a major controversy in forecasts. In 2009, Gartner predicted the PC market would experience the "sharpest unit decline in history", and a few quarters later it reported "strongest growth rate in seven years".[19] The Actual Shipment Decline started the year 2010.[20], reaching peak decline in 2016[21]
