When I started I focused so much on work I never took a second to speak to anyone. Once the job became second nature I met one of my best friends along with a lot of other great people. A huge pro for me was always being able to speak my mind and go to upper management when I had any concerns. This is a great opportunity for someone just graduating college or looking to get into the sales industry for the first time.ConsThats for you to figure out... what may be a con for me may not be a con for you :)Advice to ManagementBe transparentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-07-17 16:48 PDT Jun 18, 2017"Sales team"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeI have been working at SinglePlatform full-timeProsGreat work atmosphere, great people, fun environmentConsThe job is very repetitive and can sometimes be difficult to get creative while "sticking to the process"Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-06-18 13:29 PDT Join the SinglePlatform team See Our Latest Jobs Jun 13, 2017"Business Analyst"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeApproves of CEOI worked at SinglePlatform full-timeProsGreat atmosphere and great people to work with. You are compensated very well and the managers truly care about your success. Company happy hours and sales incentives make this a very energetic and "team" atmosphere. Monthly incentives and competitions to earn more and be rewarded. Overall, this is a tough job, but you get out what you put in. The people and management are great.

It lead to some friendships that have maintained strong even with none of us working at SP anymore.ConsWalking into work everyday and putting on that headset to lie to customers about how they need to "fix wrong information" on public sites when in actuality we were lying to them in order to make the sale the next day made me feel extremely slimy. Not only were we expected to harass these small restaurants everyday but we were also told that this was "the most important call" that these owners were receiving all day. Because of that mentality, we were told to be pushy aka overly rude and aggressive when we couldn't get the owner's phone number, or if the owner saw through the lie.Not only is the whole script a lie but also the "doable" numbers that we are expected to hit straight out of training are difficult to hit. It leads to a very stressful environment towards the end of the month. Not only will you not get your commission check but there is a strong chance of you getting fired regardless of how many meetings you create or how your effort metrics look (200 dials, 220 minutes of talk time).Whenever I needed help with anything, my manager was nowhere to be found. When I finally was able to get a hold of her, she was hardly ever that helpful and quite honestly made me feel like I was putting her out for asking a question.If you are looking to work for SinglePlatform, I highly recommend thinking strongly about if you want to work at a call center. Also don't believe what the people interviewing you say. I was not told about any of this.Advice to ManagementBe more transparent in the interview process, actually listen and help your team (esp for one month hunters who have no idea what to do). Stop with the email chains that belittle people who aren't hitting their goals (it doesn't make people want to work any harder).Change the cold call to something that isn't a lie. Maybe actually tell them what it is that we do so that these owners don't get angry. One day pitch should also be a thing because if you have an owner on the phone now, the odds go down that they will pick up tomorrow especially when they know it is a sales pitch.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-07-12 12:09 PDT Jun 8, 2017 Helpful (4)"Senior Business Analyst"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Senior Business Analyst in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Senior Business Analyst in New York, NYDoesn't RecommendPositive OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at SinglePlatform full-time (More than 3 years)ProsThe main reason anyone sticks around is for the money and the people, there is really a great group of people that work here and they become your family and friends!ConsTo be quite frank, the job really sucks. After doing it for about three years or so it is really just the same thing day after day. Cold calling, pitching new people the product, and then trying to get there credit card. They teach you to not hang up the phone and keep talking to these business owners in the hopes of convincing them that they need singleplatform which sometimes works and sometimes make these people really upset. Room for growth is very limited and the sales goals each month are pretty high. A sale and a half a day to a sale a day gets pretty tough and stressful on when the end of the month comes and you are behind on goal.Advice to ManagementProvide some job security to your employees, they are always stressed out about losing there job and not being able to pay for rent the next month. Also be very transparent on why people leave and stop having the whole floor just gossip on why people quit or get fired.. we are all adults here, the turn over rate is already so high, and why not calm people's nerves by letting them know what's going on instead of wonder. Also, stop micro managing- I get it... you are trying to stay on top of people and trying to make the job fun but cold calling is never fun....from when I was in the hunter zone it used to be so much fun and now it's just like --- ugh I would hate to be a new hire it's like they are trying way to hard..... Also, if you are going to make sure full cycle reps are hitting there effort metrics you should also make sure your closers are hitting them too.... I mean I am a closer I never hit them... (oops) maybe give them some incentive to keep their hunters.... cause right now I have the opportunity to be lazy because no one is "watching" me sorta say.... Trust your employees and let them breathe every once in a while.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-06-08 08:11 PDT May 6, 2017"Lovely Humans @SP"StarStarStarStarStarCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Inside Sales RepresentativeCurrent Employee - Inside Sales RepresentativeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at SinglePlatform full-time (Less than a year)ProsI feel that this review is long overdue, but something that I have felt compelled to write for a very long time.So here it goes.I am a current employee of SinglePlaform. Before arriving here, I came from the grime of bohemia—spending my first two years out of college sleeping on couches instead of paying rent, performing in dingy spaces across the city, doing odd, crappy jobs—just suffering for the art, because “yolo” right?I came to SinglePlatform because I was desperate for stability and knew that sales were an analogous skillset to my theatre background (and frankly a sound alternative to performing in the bowls of New York City dungeons).I believe I was the antithesis of their employable prototype. I was a little older than the mean age of staff there. I had no business background whatsoever. I also had limited experience in sales…so it was a true leap for me. I remember walking in there and seeing Greek lettering stapled to the wall, State School swag splashed across the desks in collegiate obeisance, the “Bro” species suited up with headsets and exploding with alpha-confidence. The only thing I could think of was “O.M.G., how will I ever fit in here?!”However, in the ephemeral words of Elle Woods: first impressions aren’t everything.Needless to say, different as I was—the tortured artist with chips on her shoulder in six different places—I was welcomed to this company with open arms. 6 months into my employment, I can say with confidence, these people are some of the most supportive and lovely humans I have come across in a very long time. Words cannot fully impart the tremendous gratitude I have for the people, reps and management alike. I struggled so much the past few months (well years, but that’s a different story). I went through several hospitalizations while at SP, some truly nasty personal drama, and more pertinently, I was (well, still am) rather mediocre at the job. However, for all the tornados and tempests that I am, management stood by me the entire time, helping me both personally and professionally. Every time a spattered into a puddle of stress and self-doubt, they’d take me to their office and ask me genuinely and kindly “how can I help you succeed?” They ask this, not because they have to. It’s because they want you to get better, be stronger. They care just as much for helping small business as they do for their employees. And I’m certain that this is true. The SinglePlatform Company, for all its ups and downs, is embedded with the human element. They’re not a group of sterile people, not machines at a desk spitting numbers by rote all day long. These guys are filled with both humor and grace. That alone, is worth coming to every morning at 9:00am and cold calling some SMBs.ConsBefore anyone applies, you should know, for most of you, THIS WILL BE A DIFFICULT JOB, because it’s SALES and that’s the name of the game. You will get rejected 1000 times, told insane things on the phone, may even say insane things back (though I advise, keep yourself together and be CLASSY). Some of you might want to quit after the first month, because let’s be real, cold calling is a hard knock lyfe. Stick with it if you can. I can assure you though, whether you want to go into sales as your career, or you have that entrepreneurial spirit, or whether you just want to boost you EQ* (emotion intelligence*, trust me, in any business venture, YOU NEED IT), Inside Sales at SP is a terrific foundation. And you need to master the cold call. It’s essential for every business transaction you will make in your life. Trust it. Trust the process. Trust the management. They’re fantastic.Also, the culture is exceptionally lax here. Which is great for me, because I don’t think my rainbow personality could be confined in a pencil skirt and heels. However, don’t let it deceive you. Be mindful. I’ve learned the hard way because I’m a performer and grabbing attention to make people laugh is my strawberry jam. But it’s still an office. Don’t be an idiot.One more thing. If you are like me, juggling other ventures, or just have a very robust after work life, this job is not the easiest to juggle with. It really requires you to be on and focused all the time. I spend a lot of sleepless nights finishing up my projects and sometimes come into work tired and grumpy. It can be done, I do it, but I don't recommend it. So unless you're a nut like me, try and just focus on the job. It's the only way to get better.Advice to ManagementGradie Oakes, Matt Deis, Chelsea Luther, Meg Riley, Josh Glantz and now Ben Rosen--keep being awesome. I think the world of you guys. That's all.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-05-06 08:23 PDT May 3, 2017"Great training and happy culture"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookI worked at SinglePlatform full-timeProsIf you are looking to get your feet wet in sales and working with local businesses, SinglePlatform is an invaluable experience.ConsYou have to be outgoing enough to integrate to the culture, it's put you at an advantage when looking to move up -- same could be said for most companies out there.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-05-03 16:02 PDT Apr 27, 2017"Best Sales Job to Launch your Sales Career"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeI have been working at SinglePlatform full-timePros-Hands on training.- Competitive environment- Great Incentives-Growth opportunities- Incredible PeopleCons- You need to be willing to work hard...Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-04-27 08:21 PDT Apr 14, 2017"Nice people"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsApproves of CEOProsNice group of people to work withConsLack of growth and work can be redundant.

The atmosphere/ energy is insane, the people are amazing, and management is always there to help. As an employee of this amazing company, I consider myself lucky to be a part of it and have the opportunity to grow my skills here. It's a job that requires hard work that is definitely not for just any type of person, but if you are willing to put in the effort, there is a ton of money to be made and a ton of incentives to be awarded. HIGHLY suggest if you're looking to make a lot of money and are a goal-oriented person who is competitive and loves grinding to apply here.ConsI honestly love everything about the company. Anyone who reports any negative comments is someone who is not willing to work hard to achieve success/ cash and instead just wants things handed to them.Advice to ManagementContinue what you're doing. No manager micro manages but instead trusts that you will get the job done.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) SinglePlatform Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SinglePlatform 2017-03-07 05:20 PST Showing 112 of 114 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > SinglePlatform RSS Feed</>Embed SinglePlatform Careers SinglePlatform connects businesses with consumers who are searching online for products and services in their local area.
