FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.

  Sanchez Energy





Sanchez Energy Corporation was formed in August 2011 and completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on December 19, 2011. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SN.”
Concurrent with our IPO, we acquired assets concentrated in the Eagle Ford Shale trend of South Texas, as well as smaller positions in the Haynesville Shale and northern Montana, from Sanchez Energy Partners I, LP (“SEP I”), a private equity investment fund sponsored by Sanchez Oil & Gas Corporation. Also concurrent with our IPO, we acquired our Marquis position in the Eagle Ford Shale. SEP I subsequently distributed or sold all of its SN shares and no longer holds an interest in Sanchez Energy Corporation.
Since our IPO we have further expanded our Eagle Ford presence by acquiring our Cotulla assets in May 2013, Wycross assets in October 2013, Catarina assets in June 2014 and several other smaller acreage acquisitions. More recently, we acquired 77,500 net acres (Comanche) in the Eagle Ford shale in March 2017.  Outside the Eagle Ford, we hold a 69,000 net leasehold acreage position in what we believe to be the core of the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale.
We currently hold a major producing position in the liquids-rich region of the Eagle Ford Shale where the economics are proving to be some of the strongest among U.S. onshore basins.  We have implemented an active drilling program and increased our average daily production significantly since our IPO.

From building its own customized proprietary operations-support software system, to utilizing the latest technologies like the zipper fracturing method, Sanchez Energy is an exciting company to be a part of. I believe this is a career destination where I can grow and optimize my potential, versus a job stop along the way.”

They care about me, my career trajectory and they care about the people where we have operations. We are truly one team – and successes are shared. The company leaders know me by name and know about me personally. There are not many companies that can say that.”
Our Internship Program

I have had hands-on involvement in ongoing projects to work in different areas of expertise such as production, drilling and completion.  Also, Sanchez is a staff of helpful and kind people who are always willing to provide you with the tools you need to grow as a professional and to know how the Oil industry works.

Eagle Ford

  April 8, 2014
  Sanchez Energy





We have a long history in the Eagle Ford Shale, where we have assembled approximately 335,000 net leasehold acres. Using approximately 75 acre well-spacing for our Maverick area, approximately 120 acre well-spacing for our Javelina area, approximately 40 acre well‑spacing for our Palmetto area, approximately 60 acre well‑spacing for our Marquis area and approximately 75 acre well‑spacing for our Catarina area, and assuming 80% of the acreage is drillable for our Maverick, Javelina, Marquis and Catarina areas, and 90% of the acreage is drillable for our Palmetto area, we believe that there could be over 3,300 potential gross (3,050 net) locations for potential future drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale. Including our Comanche Acquisition, we have over 7,300 potential gross (4,050 net) Eagle Ford locations for potential drilling. Our average well-spacing for the Comanche area is planned to be 600 foot apparent spacing (in zone), with plans for multi-bench development of two to four Eagle Ford targets across our acreage position. For the year 2017, we plan to invest substantially all of our capital budget in the Eagle Ford Shale.
In our Catarina area, we have approximately 106,000 net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas with a 100% working interest. We anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $3.0 million and $4.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current Estimated Ultimate Recovery (“EUR”) per well in Catarina is expected to range between 400 MBoe and 1,200 MBoe. We have identified between 1,300 and 1,650 gross and net locations for potential future drilling on our Catarina acreage. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $160 million to $170 million to spud 49 net wells and complete 53 net wells in our Catarina area.
In our Comanche area, we have approximately 77,500 net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas with a 24% working interest. We anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $3.0 million and $4.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current Estimated Ultimate Recovery (“EUR”) per well in Comanche is expected to range between 500 MBoe and 800 MBoe. We have identified over 4,000 and 1,000 gross and net locations for potential future drilling on our Comanche acreage. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $130 million to $150 million to drill 21 net wells and complete 32 net drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells.
In our Maverick area, we have approximately 100,000 net acres in Dimmit, Frio, LaSalle, Zavala, and McMullen Counties, Texas with an average working interest of approximately 96%. We believe that our Maverick acreage lies in the black oil window, where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $3.0 million and $4.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current EUR per well in Maverick is expected to range between 300 MBoe and 400 MBoe. We have identified up to 1,100 gross (1,000 net) locations based on 75 acre well‑spacing for potential future drilling on our Maverick area. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $100 million to $110 million to spud 35 net wells and complete 35 net wells in our Maverick area.
In our Javelina area, we have approximately 39,500 net acres in LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas with an average working interest of 100%. Our Javelina acreage encompasses proven Eagle Ford down-dip areas. We currently anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $6.0 million and $7.5 million per well based on our current estimates. We expect average EUR per well in Javelina to range between 1,500 MBoe and 2,500 MBoe. We have identified up to 265 gross (265 net) locations based on 120 acre well-spacing for potential future drilling on our Javelina area. For the year 2017, we do not plan to drill any wells in this area.
In our Palmetto area, we have approximately 8,000 net acres in Gonzales County, Texas with an average working interest of approximately 49%. We believe that our Palmetto acreage lies in the volatile oil window where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $5.5 and $6.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current EUR per well in Palmetto is expected to range between 500 MBoe and 600 MBoe. We have identified up to 295 gross (143 net) locations based on 40 acre well‑spacing for potential future drilling in our Palmetto area. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $5 million to $10 million to spud 2 net wells and complete three net wells in our Palmetto area.
In our Marquis area, we have approximately 21,000 net acres, the majority of which are in southwest Fayette and northeast Lavaca Counties, Texas with a 100% working interest. We believe that our Marquis acreage lies in the volatile oil window, where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $4.0 million and $5.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current EUR per well in Marquis is expected to range between 275 MBoe and 375 MBoe. We have identified up to 200 gross and net locations based on 60 acre well‑spacing for potential future drilling on our Marquis acreage. For the year 2017, we do not have any planned capital spending on drilling and completions in our Marquis area.
