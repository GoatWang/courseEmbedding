Description

					OMEGA's new precision-machined adaptors,
connectors, and stopcocks can be easily
integrated with a variety of assemblies and
test apparatus. They are used in industrial
and laboratory applications where precision
luer-type connectors are required.
ADAPTORS
Provide secure connections and easy disconnect applications
for your fluid handling and Luer-fitting needs.
Made of nickel-plated 360 brass.
FLUSHING MANIFOLDS
Pressure manifolds make it possible to design a miniature piping
system utilizing various luer connections. Flushing manifolds allow
liquids to be flushed through needles, catheters and other
components. The manifolds are made of nickel-plated 360 brass .
PRESSURE MONITORING MANIFOLDS
OMEGA’s extensive selection of pressure monitoring manifolds allows
the user to create his own miniature piping systems utilizing various
luer connections. The sturdy metal base with metal luer fittings can be
sterilized for repeated, reliable, economical service. All pressure
monitoring manifolds are made of nickel-plated 360 brass.
Stopcocks
These high quality, leak-proof luer fittings are manufactured to the
ANSI/HIMA MD70.1 standard. Luer stopcocks are made of Type
360 Brass and are chrome-plated. These stopcocks are easily
integrated into assemblies with other stopcocks, manifolds, adaptors
and glass syringes.
Jumbo Glass Syringes
These jumbo glass syringes meet the highest standards of accuracy
and uniformity and are a staple in laboratory and industrial
applications. The body and plunger are made of borosilicate glass
for corrosion and heat resistance.

                    In June 2003, Truett Craft purchased a 150-acre agricultural tract near the southwest corner of Frankford and 98th Street located in the Lubbock-Cooper Independent School District.  The initial Master Plan called for 470 single-family residences and 88 garden homes.  Truett designed the location for the garden homes in the center of the subdivision with only one entrance.  It was his expectation to have an ideal quiet location with rear entry garages for retirees. 

Truett wanted the subdivision to be complete with an elementary school and a church.  Truett was the son of a Methodist preacher and he donated the southwest corner of 98th and Frankford to St. Luke's Methodist Church.  

Lakewood Estates was built in a series of cul-de-sacs that includes triple cul-de-sacs that give an added measure of security to the addition.
The main builders in the subdivision for single-family homes are: Creative Homes, David Rogers Homes, Gerald Long Builders, Kim Craig Construction, and Art Cuevas.  Garden home builders include: Joanie Coles, Truett Craft, and Art Cuevas

              how to hook up paint tray to 6204 step ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             The install varies depending on the model of the paint tray that you are installing. Please call customer service at 888-523-3370 for further assistance.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-12-30                can I buy a replacement top piece for a 6208 ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             Yes the top of the 6208 ladder is replaceable. In order to determine which top will fit your model of ladder, we would also need the mark number (MK) on the ladder. This number can be found on the duty rating on the side rail of the ladder. If your MK is 12,13,14,15,16, or 17, you would need to order the 38-31. If your MK is 18 you would nee 38-32. If the MK on your ladder is not one of the MK's I have listed above, then we do not have a top for your model of ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-07-17                Replacement Labels                     Hi,

I work in an educational environment and have a ladder like the one shown. I noticed the labels are worn off on my ladder. I like my department (IT Dept.) compliant with OSHA. Does Werner distribute replacement labels? If so, how would I obtain these? Thank you for any help you can give. 

Sincerely, 
Philip Long

Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-10-05                What is the warrantee on this ladder?                     What is the time and coverage if it has a warrantee at all , as I can find no reference to one anywhere?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does not offer a written or implied warranty on its products. We do stand behind the quality and workmanship of our models. Issues of this nature would usually become evident within the first 6 to 12 months of ownership.

Asked by: Anonymous             As defined by OSHA standards, the 6202 is a fiberglass step stool. Step stools are designed to be climbed on the ladder top cap as well as all step.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.
