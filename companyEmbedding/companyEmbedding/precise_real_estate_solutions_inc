Commercial Due Diligence

Overview
Workflow
Products




Untangle the web of complex business. Never be caught not knowing.Commercial organizations often have many layers: multiple locations, many connected businesses, various associated people, various legal structures, etc. You need to know everything you can to properly assess the financial, legal and/or reputational risk that may be imposed on your business at any time. LexisNexis simplifies due diligence — delivering broader, deeper, more reliable business intelligence on your customers throughout the lifecycle.


As companies keep going, your due diligence should too.Risk assessment works best when it’s baked into business processes. We make it easy to stay on top of risk assessments at all stages of your business relationship.
Identify
Uncover comprehensive information about who you’re doing business with:

Are they who they say they are (the identity of the business and the authorized representative, and the connections between them)?
Is this a legitimate entity — or a fraud risk?
Are there other risk factors that require additional investigation?

Assess
Understand and evaluate potential threats to your business from every angle. Rely on our data resources and advanced linking capabilities to uncover subtle indicators that together can form a more precise picture of risk.

Is the potential customer/partner connected to criminal activity or sanctioned in any way?
Have executives been associated with negative news?
Any recent judgements or court filings that could indicate additional financial or reputational risk?
Are there assets, property or other low-risk barometers?

Monitor
Risk isn’t static. Changes in company ownership, new regulatory requirements, the emergence of criminal schemes — you could suddenly find yourself vulnerable. Apply our solutions to quickly detect changes in your customer profiles and reassess risk based on the most recent information.

Are there new derogatory experiences (bankruptcy, judgments, liens)?

Identify
Uncover comprehensive information about who you’re doing business with:

Are they who they say they are (the identity of the business and the authorized representative, and the connections between them)?
Is this a legitimate entity — or a fraud risk?
Are there other risk factors that require additional investigation?

Assess
Understand and evaluate potential threats to your business from every angle. Rely on our data resources and advanced linking capabilities to uncover subtle indicators that together can form a more precise picture of risk.

Is the potential customer/partner connected to criminal activity or sanctioned in any way?
Have executives been associated with negative news?
Any recent judgements or court filings that could indicate additional financial or reputational risk?
Are there assets, property or other low-risk barometers?

Monitor
Risk isn’t static. Changes in company ownership, new regulatory requirements, the emergence of criminal schemes — you could suddenly find yourself vulnerable. Apply our solutions to quickly detect changes in your customer profiles and reassess risk based on the most recent information.

Are there new derogatory experiences (bankruptcy, judgments, liens)?
