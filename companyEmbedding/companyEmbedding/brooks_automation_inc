History[edit]
Brooks Automation was set up in 1978 and incorporated in 1994.
In 2002, Brooks Automation, Inc. completed the acquisition of Intelligent Automation Systems, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a custom automation company with technology and products for the semiconductor, photonics and life sciences industries.[4]
Brooks Automation acquired the Celigo automated Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect, Inc in 2011. The next year the company acquired intangible assets from Intevac, Inc. and acquired Crossing Automation Inc.[5][6]
In October 2012, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to acquire Crossing Automation Inc. [7]
In April 2014, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to sell its Granville-Phillips division to MKS Instruments. [8]
Brooks closed the sale of Granville-Phillips to MKS Instruments on May 30, 2014. [9]
Products[edit]
Brooks Automation provides mainly four kinds: semiconductor automation and life science systems equipment, gas analysis and vacuum measurement, cryopumps, cryochillers and compressors, asset tracking equipment. The company features in developing and building the handling system and related technology. Automation products are used to support both atmospheric and vacuum based processes while the company's focus remains on improving performance and productivity. The company provides vacuum pumps and instrumentation to maintain pressure consistency of the known process gas. The Brooks Life Science Systems provides automated sample management systems and equipment, such as automated blood fractionation equipment, cellular imaging and consumables parts.[5]
Research and development[edit]

2013.7, Brooks Automation announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets and business of Matrical, Inc.($10 million) to expand the Brooks Life Science Systems business. Matrical focuses on biological sample preparation, management and storage solutions.[10]
2012.4, Brooks Automation announced the Polycold® Systems XC Cryochiller (a multi-purpose coole) product line and set a new standard in the industry. With the new production line put into use in vacuum and thermal management applications, it would greatly increase water vapor pumping speed and decrease the operating costs.[11]
2012.1, Brooks Automation announced that it had acquired the Celigo(R) Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect Inc.. Celigo had advantage in cell imaging systems based on its unique combination of high-throughput, ease-of-use, and affordability.[6]

Awards[edit]
Brooks Automation won the R&D 100 award (100 most technologically significant new products introduced) by R&D Magazine for its Model 830 Vacuum Quality Monitor (VQMTM). VQMTM was used to determine gas composition with an electrostatic autoresonant ion trap.[12]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

A spread collar is best when you must dress to impress. The extra space accommodates a larger tie knot such as a half or full windsor. #WednesdayWisdom
(📸: @tysevere)








Hang on tight— these @RedFleece silk camis will slip right through your fingers if you wait #TapToShop








Today's #TieTuesday pick: A Golden Fleece Textured Wool Tie worn by @matthewzorpas. The subtle check pattern gives it a textured look and feel. Made from 100% wool woven in Italy and expertly crafted in New York City.








Six new options for your best foot forward. Which one is yours?

History[edit]
Brooks Automation was set up in 1978 and incorporated in 1994.
In 2002, Brooks Automation, Inc. completed the acquisition of Intelligent Automation Systems, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a custom automation company with technology and products for the semiconductor, photonics and life sciences industries.[4]
Brooks Automation acquired the Celigo automated Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect, Inc in 2011. The next year the company acquired intangible assets from Intevac, Inc. and acquired Crossing Automation Inc.[5][6]
In October 2012, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to acquire Crossing Automation Inc. [7]
In April 2014, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to sell its Granville-Phillips division to MKS Instruments. [8]
Brooks closed the sale of Granville-Phillips to MKS Instruments on May 30, 2014. [9]
Products[edit]
Brooks Automation provides mainly four kinds: semiconductor automation and life science systems equipment, gas analysis and vacuum measurement, cryopumps, cryochillers and compressors, asset tracking equipment. The company features in developing and building the handling system and related technology. Automation products are used to support both atmospheric and vacuum based processes while the company's focus remains on improving performance and productivity. The company provides vacuum pumps and instrumentation to maintain pressure consistency of the known process gas. The Brooks Life Science Systems provides automated sample management systems and equipment, such as automated blood fractionation equipment, cellular imaging and consumables parts.[5]
Research and development[edit]

2013.7, Brooks Automation announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets and business of Matrical, Inc.($10 million) to expand the Brooks Life Science Systems business. Matrical focuses on biological sample preparation, management and storage solutions.[10]
2012.4, Brooks Automation announced the Polycold® Systems XC Cryochiller (a multi-purpose coole) product line and set a new standard in the industry. With the new production line put into use in vacuum and thermal management applications, it would greatly increase water vapor pumping speed and decrease the operating costs.[11]
2012.1, Brooks Automation announced that it had acquired the Celigo(R) Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect Inc.. Celigo had advantage in cell imaging systems based on its unique combination of high-throughput, ease-of-use, and affordability.[6]

History[edit]
Brooks Automation was set up in 1978 and incorporated in 1994.
In 2002, Brooks Automation, Inc. completed the acquisition of Intelligent Automation Systems, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a custom automation company with technology and products for the semiconductor, photonics and life sciences industries.[4]
Brooks Automation acquired the Celigo automated Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect, Inc in 2011. The next year the company acquired intangible assets from Intevac, Inc. and acquired Crossing Automation Inc.[5][6]
In October 2012, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to acquire Crossing Automation Inc. [7]
In April 2014, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to sell its Granville-Phillips division to MKS Instruments. [8]
Brooks closed the sale of Granville-Phillips to MKS Instruments on May 30, 2014. [9]
Products[edit]
Brooks Automation provides mainly four kinds: semiconductor automation and life science systems equipment, gas analysis and vacuum measurement, cryopumps, cryochillers and compressors, asset tracking equipment. The company features in developing and building the handling system and related technology. Automation products are used to support both atmospheric and vacuum based processes while the company's focus remains on improving performance and productivity. The company provides vacuum pumps and instrumentation to maintain pressure consistency of the known process gas. The Brooks Life Science Systems provides automated sample management systems and equipment, such as automated blood fractionation equipment, cellular imaging and consumables parts.[5]
Research and development[edit]

2013.7, Brooks Automation announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets and business of Matrical, Inc.($10 million) to expand the Brooks Life Science Systems business. Matrical focuses on biological sample preparation, management and storage solutions.[10]
2012.4, Brooks Automation announced the Polycold® Systems XC Cryochiller (a multi-purpose coole) product line and set a new standard in the industry. With the new production line put into use in vacuum and thermal management applications, it would greatly increase water vapor pumping speed and decrease the operating costs.[11]
2012.1, Brooks Automation announced that it had acquired the Celigo(R) Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect Inc.. Celigo had advantage in cell imaging systems based on its unique combination of high-throughput, ease-of-use, and affordability.[6]

Awards[edit]
Brooks Automation won the R&D 100 award (100 most technologically significant new products introduced) by R&D Magazine for its Model 830 Vacuum Quality Monitor (VQMTM). VQMTM was used to determine gas composition with an electrostatic autoresonant ion trap.[12]

History[edit]
Brooks Automation was set up in 1978 and incorporated in 1994.
In 2002, Brooks Automation, Inc. completed the acquisition of Intelligent Automation Systems, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a custom automation company with technology and products for the semiconductor, photonics and life sciences industries.[4]
Brooks Automation acquired the Celigo automated Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect, Inc in 2011. The next year the company acquired intangible assets from Intevac, Inc. and acquired Crossing Automation Inc.[5][6]
In October 2012, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to acquire Crossing Automation Inc. [7]
In April 2014, Brooks Automation entered into an agreement to sell its Granville-Phillips division to MKS Instruments. [8]
Brooks closed the sale of Granville-Phillips to MKS Instruments on May 30, 2014. [9]
Products[edit]
Brooks Automation provides mainly four kinds: semiconductor automation and life science systems equipment, gas analysis and vacuum measurement, cryopumps, cryochillers and compressors, asset tracking equipment. The company features in developing and building the handling system and related technology. Automation products are used to support both atmospheric and vacuum based processes while the company's focus remains on improving performance and productivity. The company provides vacuum pumps and instrumentation to maintain pressure consistency of the known process gas. The Brooks Life Science Systems provides automated sample management systems and equipment, such as automated blood fractionation equipment, cellular imaging and consumables parts.[5]
Research and development[edit]

2013.7, Brooks Automation announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets and business of Matrical, Inc.($10 million) to expand the Brooks Life Science Systems business. Matrical focuses on biological sample preparation, management and storage solutions.[10]
2012.4, Brooks Automation announced the Polycold® Systems XC Cryochiller (a multi-purpose coole) product line and set a new standard in the industry. With the new production line put into use in vacuum and thermal management applications, it would greatly increase water vapor pumping speed and decrease the operating costs.[11]
2012.1, Brooks Automation announced that it had acquired the Celigo(R) Cell Cytometer product line from Cyntellect Inc.. Celigo had advantage in cell imaging systems based on its unique combination of high-throughput, ease-of-use, and affordability.[6]

Awards[edit]
Brooks Automation won the R&D 100 award (100 most technologically significant new products introduced) by R&D Magazine for its Model 830 Vacuum Quality Monitor (VQMTM). VQMTM was used to determine gas composition with an electrostatic autoresonant ion trap.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
