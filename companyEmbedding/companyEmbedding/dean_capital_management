Consensus Ratings for MEDIFAST INC (NYSE:MED) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $36.00 (16.06% downside)

According to Zacks Investment Research, "Over the past six months, Tetra Tech’s shares have charted a strong upward trajectory, outperforming the Zacks categorized Pollution Control Equipment and Services industry’s average return. Tetra Tech’s robust financial health, strong backlog levels and diligent capital deployment strategies signal brighter days ahead. The company is enjoying steady top-line growth and improved operating efficiency resulting from cost-management initiatives. Going forward, Tetra Tech remains bullish about its growth across all client sectors. However, softness in the domestic oil and gas segment and general economic conditions may weigh down on the company’s financials, going forward. This apart, the cyclical nature of the key markets served by the company poses a sustained threat to stable growth of the company. Decreased consumer confidence and stringent competition may also add to the company’s woes." (7/10/2017)
2. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "TTEK reported 1Q17 ongoing EPS of $0.49, exceeding our estimate and the consensus of $0.47. Core profitability was in-line with expectations. Highlights of the quarter included 24% organic growth in State and Local, 15% organic growth in core Federal, and record backlog. We anticipate continued strength in these end markets. TTEK shares fell 5%+ (vs a flat S&P 500) following the report and partially recovered Friday with a 3.6% increase (vs a 0.7% increase in the S&P 500). We believe these moves may reflect some skittishness around the prospects of a large Federal Infrastructure bill moving forward in the next year. We are raising our ongoing adjusted EPS estimates slightly to $0.44 (from $0.43) in 2Q17, and $2.16 (from $2.14) for the full year. While we anticipate continued strength in TTEK's core business and see the company as a key beneficiary of potential infrastructure spending, we maintain our Hold rating on concerns that shares will be somewhat range bound until clarity emerges on the Federal government's plans" (2/6/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $47.50 (1.60% upside)
