Frequently Asked Questions

What reporting do you offer?
Once a month you will receive an official Search Engine Marketing report. It contains:

A breakup of campaign performance at the campaign, ad group, ad copy and keyword level
Optimization highlights & takeaways
A ‘Moving Forward’ section

See an example of an AdWords Report.
Furthermore, we also always urge our clients to join a shared screen session where we discuss the monthly report and the plan moving for the following month(s).
Weekly or bi-weekly optimization updates via email are also standard as well as the ability to set up a phone meeting any time you see fit.

Can all businesses succeed with Bing Ads?
In theory, every single business can get success with Bing Ads. However, in practice you’ll discover that some industries have a very low amount of search volume with Bing Ads.
In White Shark Media we have a proven process for determining whether a business will get success from advertising with Bing Ads. Feel free to reach out to one of our Digital Media Advisor to learn more about your opportunities.

Is My Budget Paid Directly to White Shark Media?
No. Your ad spend and the White Shark Media management fees are paid separately.
Your ad spend is paid to Bing Ads or Google AdWords. The White Shark Media management fee is paid directly to White Shark Media through 2Checkout.com (our online payment processing partner).

Frequently Asked Questions

Do You Completely Discard My Own Campaign When Building Yours?
All the data that you have collected in your campaign is carefully weighed in when we create our new campaign.
The best ideas on how to build your new campaign are often found within your old campaign. It’s not always the case, but in 95% of the campaigns we build in White Shark Media, we gain insight into the client’s previous campaign.

Is My Budget Paid Directly to White Shark Media?
No. Your ad spend and the White Shark Media management fees are paid separately.
Your ad spend is paid to Bing Ads or Google AdWords. The White Shark Media management fee is paid directly to White Shark Media through 2Checkout.com (our online payment processing partner).

What reporting do you offer?
Once a month you will receive an official Search Engine Marketing report. It contains:

A breakup of campaign performance at the campaign, ad group, ad copy and keyword level
Optimization highlights & takeaways
A ‘Moving Forward’ section

See an example of an AdWords Report.
Furthermore, we also always urge our clients to join a shared screen session where we discuss the monthly report and the plan moving for the following month (s).
Weekly or bi-weekly optimization updates via email are also standard as well as the ability to set up a phone meeting any time you see fit.

Do you create Google Shopping data feeds from scratch?
Unfortunately not. Due to the time-extensive manner of creating and subsequently keeping the data feed updated we can’t create data feeds from scratch.
At the very least we need your Shopping Cart software to export your product list via an XML file. Most major Shopping Cart providers offer this as standard in their platform. Your Digital Media Advisor will be able to identify what Shopping Cart you have and whether we can manage your Google Shopping campaigns.

Fiber Products for FTTx and Fiber Protection
PPC is a pioneering fiber optic cable manufacturer and protected fiber solutions provider whose aim is to reduce the cost of fiber cable deployment across multiple markets, from automotive and aerospace to data centers and telcos.
Fiber optics sit at the heart of modern technology and the Internet age. But, for all its advancement, fiber remains a delicate and highly specialized material. It is easily damaged and requires specialist skills during installation and usage.
For these reasons, the deployment of fiber often carries with it greater commercial risks and higher costs versus less attractive options. In many instances, these risks force operators and engineers to think twice before using fiber cable in their products or projects.
Taking the risk out of fiber optic cable deployment
We believe that the deployment of fiber cable should be easy and cost-effective. In order to achieve this, fiber needs to withstand the rigors of installation and use. So we develop revolutionary fiber protection technologies, which deliver robustness without sacrificing flexibility and low weight. And when fiber cable is light, flexible and robust installation becomes significantly easier, no matter the application.
Pioneers in fiber protection for enterprise and industry
Protecting fiber is at the heart of what PPC does. Our first development was our fiber protection tube, bend-limiting tubing to manage fiber in data centers. From there we began working with the aerospace and auto industries, protecting fiber for car and flight systems. This singular focus on enabling low-risk, low-cost fiber deployment led us to address what has become our largest market: fiber to the premises (FTTP) and fiber to the home (FTTH) installations for the telecoms industries.
The inventors of pushable fiber for FTTx

Labor typically accounts for 80 per cent of the cost of an FTTP deployment, given the highly skilled personnel and specialist equipment required when using traditional methods. In order to help reduce these costs, we invented the technology behind pushable fiber. Our Miniflex™ fiber optic cable is now regarded as the premier pushable fiber product on the market.
Miniflex cable is made with a rugged plastic polymer that is robust in terms of crush and tensile strength. Our patented “live hinge” grooving helps it remain incredibly flexible while resisting kinking and bunching during installation. This combination allows Miniflex cable to be pushed into duct or through crowded risers with ease.
Ongoing innovation
We continue to innovate around our core values. We have developed a range of microducts with the lowest inner lining friction levels in the industry to make installations more efficient. The Miniflex® cable sits at the center of a newly developed MDU solution that balances cost against future deployment growth needs. We invented a pre-terminated cable with a self-assembly SC connector (QuikPush™) to remove the need for field splicing. And we have designed an incredibly tough but lightweight aerial cable that is being rolled out around the world.
With the importance of fiber optics only continuing to grow, we are proud to be offering our clients smart fiber solutions that increase efficiency, lower costs and take risk out of installation.

History[edit]
The company was founded on March 16, 1879 by 23-year-old Robert McNeil, who paid $167 for a drugstore complete with fixtures, inventory and soda fountain, as a retail pharmacy, in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, PA, United States. Robert McNeil was a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (University of the Sciences in Philadelphia).
In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company would focus on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman.[2] In 1953 McNeil Laboratories introduced Algoson, a preparation containing acetaminophen together with sodium butabarbital, a sedative. In 1955, McNeil Laboratories introduced Tylenol Elixir for children, containing only acetaminophen.
In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1961, the company moved into its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania headquarters. Along with its Fort Washington plant, McNeil also has plants worldwide.
In 1977, two companies were created: McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company or McNeil Consumer Healthcare. The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical.
In 2001, McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty medicals products. However, it was changed again and is now known as "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".
As part of Procter & Gamble's acquisition of Gillette in 2005, Procter & Gamble's Gillette was required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest itself of Rembrandt toothpaste.[3] Consequently, it sold Rembrandt to Johnson & Johnson's McNeil-PPC division.[3] [4][5][6] That year, Rembrandt had sales that likely exceeded $100 million.[3]
The company markets over-the-counter and prescription medicals products including complete lines of Tylenol and Motrin IB (ibuprofen) products for adults and children. The company is located in Fort Washington, PA, and currently employs 2,600 people. Annual sales in 2004 were US $2.1 billion. McNeil's Canadian head office is in Markham, Ontario.
McNeil Nutritionals[edit]
McNeil Nutritionals, LLC markets and sells a range of products including Lactaid, the branded sucralose sweetener Splenda, and Benecol in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, and in the US under license from Raisio Group.
In June 2007, McNeil became involved in lawsuits with Merisant (makers of the artificial sweetener Equal).[7] More recently, it has started producing a sweetener made with stevia and cane sugar, marketed as Sun Crystals.
In 2012, it started to sell a monk fruit-based sweetener called Nectresse.[8]
Johnson & Johnson Merck Joint Venture[edit]
Known as the "JV," this 50/50 joint venture between Johnson & Johnson and Merck handled the OTC product lines Pepcid, Mylanta, and Mylicon and is located at the McNeil Consumer Healthcare headquarters in Fort Washington, PA.
In September 2011, however, the JV ended, when Merck sold its 50 percent interest in the joint venture. Merck said it sold its interest in the joint venture so it could focus on building the consumer products division it gained through its acquisition of Schering-Plough in 2009. By terminating the joint venture, Merck said it will have greater freedom to exploit opportunities to switch prescription medicines to over-the-counter products that can be purchased without a doctor’s prescription. As a result, all former Johnson & Johnson-Merck products are now handled by McNeil Consumer Healthcare.
1982 Chicago Tylenol murders[edit]
Main article: 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders
In 1982, seven people were murdered in Chicago by Tylenol manufactured by McNeil Consumer Healthcare that had been tampered with after manufacture and placed on the store shelves.
2010 Product recall[edit]
Main article: 2010 Johnson & Johnson children's product recall
In April 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines. Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl products were affected.[9]

History[edit]
The company was founded on March 16, 1879 by 23-year-old Robert McNeil, who paid $167 for a drugstore complete with fixtures, inventory and soda fountain, as a retail pharmacy, in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, PA, United States. Robert McNeil was a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (University of the Sciences in Philadelphia).
In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company would focus on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman.[2] In 1953 McNeil Laboratories introduced Algoson, a preparation containing acetaminophen together with sodium butabarbital, a sedative. In 1955, McNeil Laboratories introduced Tylenol Elixir for children, containing only acetaminophen.
In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1961, the company moved into its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania headquarters. Along with its Fort Washington plant, McNeil also has plants worldwide.
In 1977, two companies were created: McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company or McNeil Consumer Healthcare. The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical.
In 2001, McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty medicals products. However, it was changed again and is now known as "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".
As part of Procter & Gamble's acquisition of Gillette in 2005, Procter & Gamble's Gillette was required by the Federal Trade Commission to divest itself of Rembrandt toothpaste.[3] Consequently, it sold Rembrandt to Johnson & Johnson's McNeil-PPC division.[3] [4][5][6] That year, Rembrandt had sales that likely exceeded $100 million.[3]
The company markets over-the-counter and prescription medicals products including complete lines of Tylenol and Motrin IB (ibuprofen) products for adults and children. The company is located in Fort Washington, PA, and currently employs 2,600 people. Annual sales in 2004 were US $2.1 billion. McNeil's Canadian head office is in Markham, Ontario.
McNeil Nutritionals[edit]
McNeil Nutritionals, LLC markets and sells a range of products including Lactaid, the branded sucralose sweetener Splenda, and Benecol in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, and in the US under license from Raisio Group.
In June 2007, McNeil became involved in lawsuits with Merisant (makers of the artificial sweetener Equal).[7] More recently, it has started producing a sweetener made with stevia and cane sugar, marketed as Sun Crystals.
In 2012, it started to sell a monk fruit-based sweetener called Nectresse.[8]
Johnson & Johnson Merck Joint Venture[edit]
Known as the "JV," this 50/50 joint venture between Johnson & Johnson and Merck handled the OTC product lines Pepcid, Mylanta, and Mylicon and is located at the McNeil Consumer Healthcare headquarters in Fort Washington, PA.
In September 2011, however, the JV ended, when Merck sold its 50 percent interest in the joint venture. Merck said it sold its interest in the joint venture so it could focus on building the consumer products division it gained through its acquisition of Schering-Plough in 2009. By terminating the joint venture, Merck said it will have greater freedom to exploit opportunities to switch prescription medicines to over-the-counter products that can be purchased without a doctor’s prescription. As a result, all former Johnson & Johnson-Merck products are now handled by McNeil Consumer Healthcare.
1982 Chicago Tylenol murders[edit]
Main article: 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders
In 1982, seven people were murdered in Chicago by Tylenol manufactured by McNeil Consumer Healthcare that had been tampered with after manufacture and placed on the store shelves.
2010 Product recall[edit]
Main article: 2010 Johnson & Johnson children's product recall
In April 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines. Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl products were affected.[9]

Frequently Asked Questions

What reporting do you offer?
Once a month you will receive an official Search Engine Marketing report. It contains:

A breakup of campaign performance at the campaign, ad group, ad copy and keyword level
Optimization highlights & takeaways
A ‘Moving Forward’ section

See an example of an AdWords Report.
Furthermore, we also always urge our clients to join a shared screen session where we discuss the monthly report and the plan moving for the following month(s).
Weekly or bi-weekly optimization updates via email are also standard as well as the ability to set up a phone meeting any time you see fit.

Can all businesses succeed with Bing Ads?
In theory, every single business can get success with Bing Ads. However, in practice you’ll discover that some industries have a very low amount of search volume with Bing Ads.
In White Shark Media we have a proven process for determining whether a business will get success from advertising with Bing Ads. Feel free to reach out to one of our Digital Media Advisor to learn more about your opportunities.

Is My Budget Paid Directly to White Shark Media?
No. Your ad spend and the White Shark Media management fees are paid separately.
Your ad spend is paid to Bing Ads or Google AdWords. The White Shark Media management fee is paid directly to White Shark Media through 2Checkout.com (our online payment processing partner).

Frequently Asked Questions

Do You Completely Discard My Own Campaign When Building Yours?
All the data that you have collected in your campaign is carefully weighed in when we create our new campaign.
The best ideas on how to build your new campaign are often found within your old campaign. It’s not always the case, but in 95% of the campaigns we build in White Shark Media, we gain insight into the client’s previous campaign.

Is My Budget Paid Directly to White Shark Media?
No. Your ad spend and the White Shark Media management fees are paid separately.
Your ad spend is paid to Bing Ads or Google AdWords. The White Shark Media management fee is paid directly to White Shark Media through 2Checkout.com (our online payment processing partner).

What reporting do you offer?
Once a month you will receive an official Search Engine Marketing report. It contains:

A breakup of campaign performance at the campaign, ad group, ad copy and keyword level
Optimization highlights & takeaways
A ‘Moving Forward’ section

See an example of an AdWords Report.
Furthermore, we also always urge our clients to join a shared screen session where we discuss the monthly report and the plan moving for the following month (s).
Weekly or bi-weekly optimization updates via email are also standard as well as the ability to set up a phone meeting any time you see fit.

Do you create Google Shopping data feeds from scratch?
Unfortunately not. Due to the time-extensive manner of creating and subsequently keeping the data feed updated we can’t create data feeds from scratch.
At the very least we need your Shopping Cart software to export your product list via an XML file. Most major Shopping Cart providers offer this as standard in their platform. Your Digital Media Advisor will be able to identify what Shopping Cart you have and whether we can manage your Google Shopping campaigns.
