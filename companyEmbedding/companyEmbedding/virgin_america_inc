Virgin America Inc. is an American airline that was founded in 2004 and began operations in 2007. Headquartered in Burlingame, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco International Airport as its main hub, Virgin America is a brand that was created by the British Virgin Group as an American counterpart to the corporation's other airlines.[4] The airline flies between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards.[5] Virgin America's frequent flyer program Elevate provides award flights and other benefits to frequent fliers.[6]
Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in 2016, at a valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion.[7] With the transaction, Virgin America became a sister carrier to the other Alaska Air Group subsidiaries Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.[8] Alaska Air Group is set to merge Virgin America with Alaska Airlines, with a single operating certificate expected to be produced in 2019.[9]

History[edit]
Early development and setbacks (2004–2007)[edit]
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called "Virgin USA". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[4] The airline changed its name from "Virgin USA" to "Virgin America" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[10]
Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[11] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[12] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[13]
In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation-approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline's board of directors and possibly removing the "Virgin" brand from the title altogether.[14] Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid.[15] The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid's removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests.[16] The Department of Transportation's final agreement was to allow Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.[17]
Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]




"Air Colbert", the aircraft used on Virgin America's inaugural flight, on the ground at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport


Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007 the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights - the aircraft were named "Air Colbert", after comedian Stephen Colbert and "California Dreaming".[18] In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline.[19] From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.[20][17]
On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight.[21] Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google.[22] On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.[23]




Virgin America's check-in area at Chicago O'Hare.


In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination.[24] Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010.[25] However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011.[26] Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.[27]
Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010.[28] In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines.[29] In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program.[30] On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.[31] Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.[32]

Alaska Airlines merger (2016–present)[edit]
A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale.[33] Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group.[34] In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, 47% higher than the day's closure at $38.9.[35] On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.[7] Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.[36]
Virgin America's founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded.[37] In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle.[38] In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016.[39] Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14.[8] Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.[40]
Virgin America is scheduled to be the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it won't take delivery of all 10 jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet.[41] As of the end of February 2017, Airbus has removed Virgin America from its order book.[42]
On March 22, 2017, the Alaska Air Group announced that the Virgin America brand would be retired "sometime in 2019." As part of the merger, some of Virgin's amenities will be integrated into Alaska's product.[9] As Alaska Group is licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand is retired.[43]
Leased by GECAS, the first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America configured with 184 seats and LEAP engines, it should enter service on May 31 ; all leased from the same lessor, five A321neos should be delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018 if its buyer Alaska Airlines keeps two fleet types.[44]

Cabin[edit]




Virgin America Economy Class






Virgin America First Class


Inflight entertainment[edit]
Virgin America offers dual-class service on all flights it operates. Both cabins feature mood lighting and all seats are equipped with Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities.[56] The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.[57]
Seating[edit]
First Class seats offer 55 inches (1,400 mm) of pitch and are 21 inches (530 mm) wide. The seats feature power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class receive complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages and receive dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, Red offers free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. The front lavatory is for first class guests only.[58]
Main Cabin Select is Virgin America's premium economy product.[59] It is not a distinct class; instead, the service is located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. Passengers are offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and have 38 inches (970 mm) of seat pitch, 17.7 inches (450 mm) of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages are free, as are the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding are prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. The lavatories in the back are for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.[59]
Main Cabin seats offer 32 inches (810 mm) of pitch and are 17.7 inches (450 mm) wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. In Main Cabin, Red offers free live satellite television, pay-per-view on-demand movies and on-demand television shows, a small selection of free games and a larger selection of games for purchase.[58] Passengers can order snacks, meals, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via Red. Flight attendants receive the orders via a tablet computer on the food cart thereby eliminating the traditional food and beverage service.[60]

Virgin America Inc. is an American airline that was founded in 2004 and began operations in 2007. Headquartered in Burlingame, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco International Airport as its main hub, Virgin America is a brand that was created by the British Virgin Group as an American counterpart to the corporation's other airlines.[4] The airline flies between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards.[5] Virgin America's frequent flyer program Elevate provides award flights and other benefits to frequent fliers.[6]
Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in 2016, at a valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion.[7] With the transaction, Virgin America became a sister carrier to the other Alaska Air Group subsidiaries Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.[8] Alaska Air Group is set to merge Virgin America with Alaska Airlines, with a single operating certificate expected to be produced in 2019.[9]

History[edit]
Early development and setbacks (2004–2007)[edit]
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called "Virgin USA". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[4] The airline changed its name from "Virgin USA" to "Virgin America" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[10]
Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[11] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[12] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[13]
In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation-approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline's board of directors and possibly removing the "Virgin" brand from the title altogether.[14] Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid.[15] The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid's removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests.[16] The Department of Transportation's final agreement was to allow Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.[17]
Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]




"Air Colbert", the aircraft used on Virgin America's inaugural flight, on the ground at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport


Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007 the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights - the aircraft were named "Air Colbert", after comedian Stephen Colbert and "California Dreaming".[18] In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline.[19] From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.[20][17]
On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight.[21] Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google.[22] On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.[23]




Virgin America's check-in area at Chicago O'Hare.


In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination.[24] Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010.[25] However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011.[26] Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.[27]
Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010.[28] In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines.[29] In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program.[30] On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.[31] Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.[32]

Alaska Airlines merger (2016–present)[edit]
A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale.[33] Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group.[34] In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, 47% higher than the day's closure at $38.9.[35] On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.[7] Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.[36]
Virgin America's founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded.[37] In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle.[38] In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016.[39] Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14.[8] Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.[40]
Virgin America is scheduled to be the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it won't take delivery of all 10 jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet.[41] As of the end of February 2017, Airbus has removed Virgin America from its order book.[42]
On March 22, 2017, the Alaska Air Group announced that the Virgin America brand would be retired "sometime in 2019." As part of the merger, some of Virgin's amenities will be integrated into Alaska's product.[9] As Alaska Group is licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand is retired.[43]
Leased by GECAS, the first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America configured with 184 seats and LEAP engines, it should enter service on May 31 ; all leased from the same lessor, five A321neos should be delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018 if its buyer Alaska Airlines keeps two fleet types.[44]

Cabin[edit]




Virgin America Economy Class






Virgin America First Class


Inflight entertainment[edit]
Virgin America offers dual-class service on all flights it operates. Both cabins feature mood lighting and all seats are equipped with Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities.[56] The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.[57]
Seating[edit]
First Class seats offer 55 inches (1,400 mm) of pitch and are 21 inches (530 mm) wide. The seats feature power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class receive complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages and receive dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, Red offers free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. The front lavatory is for first class guests only.[58]
Main Cabin Select is Virgin America's premium economy product.[59] It is not a distinct class; instead, the service is located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. Passengers are offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and have 38 inches (970 mm) of seat pitch, 17.7 inches (450 mm) of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages are free, as are the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding are prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. The lavatories in the back are for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.[59]
Main Cabin seats offer 32 inches (810 mm) of pitch and are 17.7 inches (450 mm) wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. In Main Cabin, Red offers free live satellite television, pay-per-view on-demand movies and on-demand television shows, a small selection of free games and a larger selection of games for purchase.[58] Passengers can order snacks, meals, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via Red. Flight attendants receive the orders via a tablet computer on the food cart thereby eliminating the traditional food and beverage service.[60]

Virgin America Inc. is an American airline that was founded in 2004 and began operations in 2007. Headquartered in Burlingame, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco International Airport as its main hub, Virgin America is a brand that was created by the British Virgin Group as an American counterpart to the corporation's other airlines.[4] The airline flies between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards.[5] Virgin America's frequent flyer program Elevate provides award flights and other benefits to frequent fliers.[6]
Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in 2016, at a valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion.[7] With the transaction, Virgin America became a sister carrier to the other Alaska Air Group subsidiaries Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.[8] Alaska Air Group is set to merge Virgin America with Alaska Airlines, with a single operating certificate expected to be produced in 2019.[9]

History[edit]
Early development and setbacks (2004–2007)[edit]
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called "Virgin USA". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[4] The airline changed its name from "Virgin USA" to "Virgin America" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[10]
Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[11] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[12] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[13]
In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation-approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline's board of directors and possibly removing the "Virgin" brand from the title altogether.[14] Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid.[15] The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid's removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests.[16] The Department of Transportation's final agreement was to allow Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.[17]
Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]




"Air Colbert", the aircraft used on Virgin America's inaugural flight, on the ground at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport


Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007 the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights - the aircraft were named "Air Colbert", after comedian Stephen Colbert and "California Dreaming".[18] In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline.[19] From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.[20][17]
On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight.[21] Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google.[22] On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.[23]




Virgin America's check-in area at Chicago O'Hare.


In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination.[24] Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010.[25] However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011.[26] Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.[27]
Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010.[28] In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines.[29] In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program.[30] On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.[31] Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.[32]

Alaska Airlines merger (2016–present)[edit]
A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale.[33] Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group.[34] In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, 47% higher than the day's closure at $38.9.[35] On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.[7] Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.[36]
Virgin America's founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded.[37] In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle.[38] In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016.[39] Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14.[8] Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.[40]
Virgin America is scheduled to be the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it won't take delivery of all 10 jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet.[41] As of the end of February 2017, Airbus has removed Virgin America from its order book.[42]
On March 22, 2017, the Alaska Air Group announced that the Virgin America brand would be retired "sometime in 2019." As part of the merger, some of Virgin's amenities will be integrated into Alaska's product.[9] As Alaska Group is licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand is retired.[43]
Leased by GECAS, the first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America configured with 184 seats and LEAP engines, it should enter service on May 31 ; all leased from the same lessor, five A321neos should be delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018 if its buyer Alaska Airlines keeps two fleet types.[44]

Cabin[edit]




Virgin America Economy Class






Virgin America First Class


Inflight entertainment[edit]
Virgin America offers dual-class service on all flights it operates. Both cabins feature mood lighting and all seats are equipped with Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities.[56] The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.[57]
Seating[edit]
First Class seats offer 55 inches (1,400 mm) of pitch and are 21 inches (530 mm) wide. The seats feature power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class receive complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages and receive dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, Red offers free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. The front lavatory is for first class guests only.[58]
Main Cabin Select is Virgin America's premium economy product.[59] It is not a distinct class; instead, the service is located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. Passengers are offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and have 38 inches (970 mm) of seat pitch, 17.7 inches (450 mm) of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages are free, as are the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding are prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. The lavatories in the back are for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.[59]
Main Cabin seats offer 32 inches (810 mm) of pitch and are 17.7 inches (450 mm) wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. In Main Cabin, Red offers free live satellite television, pay-per-view on-demand movies and on-demand television shows, a small selection of free games and a larger selection of games for purchase.[58] Passengers can order snacks, meals, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via Red. Flight attendants receive the orders via a tablet computer on the food cart thereby eliminating the traditional food and beverage service.[60]

Virgin America Inc. is an American airline that was founded in 2004 and began operations in 2007. Headquartered in Burlingame, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco International Airport as its main hub, Virgin America is a brand that was created by the British Virgin Group as an American counterpart to the corporation's other airlines.[4] The airline flies between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards.[5] Virgin America's frequent flyer program Elevate provides award flights and other benefits to frequent fliers.[6]
Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in 2016, at a valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion.[7] With the transaction, Virgin America became a sister carrier to the other Alaska Air Group subsidiaries Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.[8] Alaska Air Group is set to merge Virgin America with Alaska Airlines, with a single operating certificate expected to be produced in 2019.[9]

History[edit]
Early development and setbacks (2004–2007)[edit]
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called "Virgin USA". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[4] The airline changed its name from "Virgin USA" to "Virgin America" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[10]
Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[11] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[12] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[13]
In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation-approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline's board of directors and possibly removing the "Virgin" brand from the title altogether.[14] Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid.[15] The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid's removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests.[16] The Department of Transportation's final agreement was to allow Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.[17]
Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]




"Air Colbert", the aircraft used on Virgin America's inaugural flight, on the ground at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport


Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007 the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights - the aircraft were named "Air Colbert", after comedian Stephen Colbert and "California Dreaming".[18] In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline.[19] From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.[20][17]
On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight.[21] Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google.[22] On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.[23]




Virgin America's check-in area at Chicago O'Hare.


In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination.[24] Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010.[25] However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011.[26] Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.[27]
Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010.[28] In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines.[29] In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program.[30] On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.[31] Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.[32]

Alaska Airlines merger (2016–present)[edit]
A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale.[33] Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group.[34] In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, 47% higher than the day's closure at $38.9.[35] On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.[7] Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.[36]
Virgin America's founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded.[37] In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle.[38] In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016.[39] Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14.[8] Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.[40]
Virgin America is scheduled to be the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it won't take delivery of all 10 jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet.[41] As of the end of February 2017, Airbus has removed Virgin America from its order book.[42]
On March 22, 2017, the Alaska Air Group announced that the Virgin America brand would be retired "sometime in 2019." As part of the merger, some of Virgin's amenities will be integrated into Alaska's product.[9] As Alaska Group is licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand is retired.[43]
Leased by GECAS, the first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America configured with 184 seats and LEAP engines, it should enter service on May 31 ; all leased from the same lessor, five A321neos should be delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018 if its buyer Alaska Airlines keeps two fleet types.[44]

This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities.[56] The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.[57]
Seating[edit]
First Class seats offer 55 inches (1,400 mm) of pitch and are 21 inches (530 mm) wide. The seats feature power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class receive complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages and receive dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, Red offers free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. The front lavatory is for first class guests only.[58]
Main Cabin Select is Virgin America's premium economy product.[59] It is not a distinct class; instead, the service is located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. Passengers are offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and have 38 inches (970 mm) of seat pitch, 17.7 inches (450 mm) of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages are free, as are the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding are prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. The lavatories in the back are for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.[59]
Main Cabin seats offer 32 inches (810 mm) of pitch and are 17.7 inches (450 mm) wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. In Main Cabin, Red offers free live satellite television, pay-per-view on-demand movies and on-demand television shows, a small selection of free games and a larger selection of games for purchase.[58] Passengers can order snacks, meals, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via Red. Flight attendants receive the orders via a tablet computer on the food cart thereby eliminating the traditional food and beverage service.[60]

Virgin America Inc. is an American airline that was founded in 2004 and began operations in 2007. Headquartered in Burlingame, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco International Airport as its main hub, Virgin America is a brand that was created by the British Virgin Group as an American counterpart to the corporation's other airlines.[4] The airline flies between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards.[5] Virgin America's frequent flyer program Elevate provides award flights and other benefits to frequent fliers.[6]
Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in 2016, at a valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion.[7] With the transaction, Virgin America became a sister carrier to the other Alaska Air Group subsidiaries Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.[8] Alaska Air Group is set to merge Virgin America with Alaska Airlines, with a single operating certificate expected to be produced in 2019.[9]

History[edit]
Early development and setbacks (2004–2007)[edit]
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called "Virgin USA". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[4] The airline changed its name from "Virgin USA" to "Virgin America" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[10]
Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[11] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[12] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[13]
In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation-approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline's board of directors and possibly removing the "Virgin" brand from the title altogether.[14] Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid.[15] The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid's removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests.[16] The Department of Transportation's final agreement was to allow Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.[17]
Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]




"Air Colbert", the aircraft used on Virgin America's inaugural flight, on the ground at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport


Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007 the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights - the aircraft were named "Air Colbert", after comedian Stephen Colbert and "California Dreaming".[18] In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline.[19] From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.[20][17]
On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight.[21] Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google.[22] On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.[23]




Virgin America's check-in area at Chicago O'Hare.


In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination.[24] Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010.[25] However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011.[26] Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.[27]
Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010.[28] In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines.[29] In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program.[30] On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.[31] Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.[32]

Alaska Airlines merger (2016–present)[edit]
A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale.[33] Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group.[34] In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, 47% higher than the day's closure at $38.9.[35] On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.[7] Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.[36]
Virgin America's founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded.[37] In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle.[38] In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016.[39] Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14.[8] Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.[40]
Virgin America is scheduled to be the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it won't take delivery of all 10 jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet.[41] As of the end of February 2017, Airbus has removed Virgin America from its order book.[42]
On March 22, 2017, the Alaska Air Group announced that the Virgin America brand would be retired "sometime in 2019." As part of the merger, some of Virgin's amenities will be integrated into Alaska's product.[9] As Alaska Group is licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand is retired.[43]
Leased by GECAS, the first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America configured with 184 seats and LEAP engines, it should enter service on May 31 ; all leased from the same lessor, five A321neos should be delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018 if its buyer Alaska Airlines keeps two fleet types.[44]

Cabin[edit]




Virgin America Economy Class






Virgin America First Class


Inflight entertainment[edit]
Virgin America offers dual-class service on all flights it operates. Both cabins feature mood lighting and all seats are equipped with Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities.[56] The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.[57]
Seating[edit]
First Class seats offer 55 inches (1,400 mm) of pitch and are 21 inches (530 mm) wide. The seats feature power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class receive complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages and receive dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, Red offers free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. The front lavatory is for first class guests only.[58]
Main Cabin Select is Virgin America's premium economy product.[59] It is not a distinct class; instead, the service is located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. Passengers are offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and have 38 inches (970 mm) of seat pitch, 17.7 inches (450 mm) of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages are free, as are the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding are prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. The lavatories in the back are for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.[59]
Main Cabin seats offer 32 inches (810 mm) of pitch and are 17.7 inches (450 mm) wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. In Main Cabin, Red offers free live satellite television, pay-per-view on-demand movies and on-demand television shows, a small selection of free games and a larger selection of games for purchase.[58] Passengers can order snacks, meals, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via Red. Flight attendants receive the orders via a tablet computer on the food cart thereby eliminating the traditional food and beverage service.[60]

Virgin America Inc. is an American airline that was founded in 2004 and began operations in 2007. Headquartered in Burlingame, California in the San Francisco Bay Area, with San Francisco International Airport as its main hub, Virgin America is a brand that was created by the British Virgin Group as an American counterpart to the corporation's other airlines.[4] The airline flies between major metropolitan cities on the Eastern and West Coast seaboards.[5] Virgin America's frequent flyer program Elevate provides award flights and other benefits to frequent fliers.[6]
Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in 2016, at a valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion.[7] With the transaction, Virgin America became a sister carrier to the other Alaska Air Group subsidiaries Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.[8] Alaska Air Group is set to merge Virgin America with Alaska Airlines, with a single operating certificate expected to be produced in 2019.[9]

History[edit]
Early development and setbacks (2004–2007)[edit]
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called "Virgin USA". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[4] The airline changed its name from "Virgin USA" to "Virgin America" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[10]
Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[11] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[12] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[13]
In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation-approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline's board of directors and possibly removing the "Virgin" brand from the title altogether.[14] Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid.[15] The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid's removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests.[16] The Department of Transportation's final agreement was to allow Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.[17]
Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]




"Air Colbert", the aircraft used on Virgin America's inaugural flight, on the ground at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport


Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007 the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights - the aircraft were named "Air Colbert", after comedian Stephen Colbert and "California Dreaming".[18] In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline.[19] From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.[20][17]
On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo Inflight Internet on every flight.[21] Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google.[22] On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 inflight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.[23]




Virgin America's check-in area at Chicago O'Hare.


In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination.[24] Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010.[25] However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011.[26] Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.[27]
Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010.[28] In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines.[29] In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program.[30] On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.[31] Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.[32]

Alaska Airlines merger (2016–present)[edit]
A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale.[33] Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group.[34] In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, 47% higher than the day's closure at $38.9.[35] On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion.[7] Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.[36]
Virgin America's founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded.[37] In July 2016, Virgin America's shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle.[38] In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016.[39] Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the merger, which was completed on December 14.[8] Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.[40]
Virgin America is scheduled to be the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it won't take delivery of all 10 jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet.[41] As of the end of February 2017, Airbus has removed Virgin America from its order book.[42]
On March 22, 2017, the Alaska Air Group announced that the Virgin America brand would be retired "sometime in 2019." As part of the merger, some of Virgin's amenities will be integrated into Alaska's product.[9] As Alaska Group is licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand is retired.[43]
Leased by GECAS, the first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America configured with 184 seats and LEAP engines, it should enter service on May 31 ; all leased from the same lessor, five A321neos should be delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018 if its buyer Alaska Airlines keeps two fleet types.[44]

Cabin[edit]




Virgin America Economy Class






Virgin America First Class


Inflight entertainment[edit]
Virgin America offers dual-class service on all flights it operates. Both cabins feature mood lighting and all seats are equipped with Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities.[56] The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.[57]
Seating[edit]
First Class seats offer 55 inches (1,400 mm) of pitch and are 21 inches (530 mm) wide. The seats feature power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class receive complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages and receive dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, Red offers free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. The front lavatory is for first class guests only.[58]
Main Cabin Select is Virgin America's premium economy product.[59] It is not a distinct class; instead, the service is located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. Passengers are offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and have 38 inches (970 mm) of seat pitch, 17.7 inches (450 mm) of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages are free, as are the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding are prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. The lavatories in the back are for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.[59]
Main Cabin seats offer 32 inches (810 mm) of pitch and are 17.7 inches (450 mm) wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. In Main Cabin, Red offers free live satellite television, pay-per-view on-demand movies and on-demand television shows, a small selection of free games and a larger selection of games for purchase.[58] Passengers can order snacks, meals, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via Red. Flight attendants receive the orders via a tablet computer on the food cart thereby eliminating the traditional food and beverage service.[60]

Is There Room for Virgin America Inc. in Hawaii?
Virgin America Inc hopes to start flying to Hawaii later this year. Will it face too much competition in this crowded market?











                Adam Levine-Weinberg
            

                (TMFGemHunter)



            
            Mar 26, 2015 at 8:05AM
            
            





Virgin America (NASDAQ: VA) has been in the midst of a growth hiatus for more than 2 years, but it is planning to start expanding again later this year. To kick of this new growth initiative, management has already stated that adding flights to Hawaii is a key priority once it returns to growth.

Many analysts and investors seem to be skeptical of this plan. After all, Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ:HA) and other top carriers in the West Coast-Hawaii travel market have recently discussed their market's existing overcapacity.
However, San Francisco and Los Angeles -- Virgin America's two hubs -- are both huge markets for travel to Hawaii. Furthermore, Virgin America has lots of loyal fans in both cities. As a result, it should have no trouble carving out a nice market niche with its premium offering on flights to Hawaii.
Aloha, Hawaii!When Virgin America begins its flights to Hawaii, it will join a crowded market. Today, 3 carriers fly nonstop from San Francisco to Hawaii, while 5 fly nonstop from Los Angeles to Hawaii.





At first, this might make Hawaii flights seem unpalatable. However, the large number of competitors is an indicator of the massive size of these markets. This summer, airlines will operate more than 3 dozen daily flights to Hawaii from Los Angeles alone.

There are already numerous flight options between California and Hawaii. Photo: Wikimedia Commons
At present, Virgin America does extremely well on the similarly busy transcontinental routes from New York to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where it is one of 5 airlines offering nonstop service. Its unique premium offering -- with Wi-FI, mood lighting, an innovative seat-back entertainment system, and other amenities -- has allowed Virgin America to hold its own against much bigger rivals.
The same attributes should make plenty of travelers pick Virgin America when planning trips to Hawaii. Indeed, loyal Virgin America customers have been requesting flights to Hawaii for years. (As a stopgap measure, the company implemented a codeshare arrangement with Hawaiian Airlines in late 2012.)





If Virgin America's entry into the Hawaii market creates a capacity imbalance, other airlines are likely to pull back on their own Hawaii flying to foster a supply/demand balance. They would probably do so by switching to smaller planes for their Hawaii flights.
But even this may be a moot point. Hawaiian Airlines told investors this week that its Q1 unit revenue will not decline as much as originally expected. This implies that demand for West Coast-Hawaii flights may already be catching up with supply.
More reasons to love flights to HawaiiVirgin America won't have to charge outrageous fares to make money flying to Hawaii, either. The new planes it is receiving beginning in July will be modern 149-seat Airbus A320s, equipped with fuel-saving Sharklet winglets.
These planes will have lower unit costs than many of the planes currently flying to Hawaii, including medium-sized widebodies like the Boeing 777and older-technology planes like the Boeing 757.





Virgin America will also offer arguably the best first class seats for West Coast-Hawaii flights. Competitors have leapfrogged Virgin America's premium product on transcontinental routes by installing lie-flat beds, but almost all of the first class seats on Hawaii routes are the "domestic" variant.

These are no match for Virgin America's wide, white leather first class seats with 55" of legroom. This superior offering should help Virgin America drive strong sales of its lucrative first class seats.
Buckle up!Virgin America's routes to Hawaii may not be immediately profitable -- new airline routes seldom are. However, the company's relatively low costs and differentiated product should allow it to compete for the long haul on flights from its San Francisco and Los Angeles bases to Hawaii.
In fact, by bringing a premium atmosphere to Hawaii flights, Virgin America could force its competitors to up their standards -- just as it did in the transcontinental market not too long ago.

Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

VIRGIN AMERICA UNVEILS AIRLINE PRODUCT DETAILS ON LETVAFLY.COM
BURLINGAME, CA – (January 17, 2007) – Virgin America, a new U.S.-based start-up airline, today for the first time offered a look at elements of its airline product at www.LetVAFly.com, including the interior environment and details of the onboard products. The Web site offers a visual tour of the cabins and encourages travelers to share in the Virgin America travel experience and campaign to launch the airline.
Upgraded features onboard Virgin America's new Airbus A320s include mood lighting, enhanced seating in both the lavish first class and high-quality main cabins, contemporary class dividers and a self-service mini bar. These new aircraft also will feature Virgin America's innovative "Red System" of in-flight entertainment (IFE) products. The quality of the airline's launch product is a reflection of the Virgin America brand and its mission to create an airline people love.
The Aircraft Interior Environment
The interior's aesthetic was conceived and designed by Virgin America. To realize Virgin America's vision, the airline collaborated with some of the most innovative suppliers operating in their respective fields, including Airbus, Recaro Aircraft Seating, Diehl Luftfahrt Elektronik (mood-lighting systems), Driessen AIS (galleys and mini bar) and C&D Zodiac (class dividers).
"Virgin America's interior has been created to offer its guests a better experience, with unique, enhanced products designed to please and entertain," said Virgin America Design Director Adam Wells. "We simply want to make air travel better – today's airline passenger is paying for an experience that is at-best tolerable. If we are successful, passengers can expect Virgin America to deliver future innovation that ensures the flying experience keeps getting better and better."
The first-ever in the U.S. mood lighting system was custom developed with Airbus and technology partner Diehl Luftfahrt Elektronik – it is unique to Virgin America and to the aircraft type. The system detail includes:

mood lighting in both front and main cabins;
color tones and levels that slowly change over time, relative to external conditions, and help guests look and feel good;
daylight, dusk, sleep and dawn modes among others;
personal overhead reading lights, and
color-tinted windowpanes that supplement the system by reducing glare and unattractive tones inherent to daylight.

Both First Class and the main cabin will offer state-of-the-art entertainment system hardware:

touch-sensitive 9-inch widescreen entertainment systems deployed from the central armrests;
in-arm entertainment handsets with backlit hot-buttons, full ‘qwerty' keyboards and gaming controls, and
adaptor-free 110v power, USB and RJ-45 jacks at every seat with standard headphone sockets.

The First Class cabin will have just eight seats set in a room-like environment. Special features of the First Class cabin begin with its luxurious seating, manufactured by Recaro Aircraft Seating to Virgin America's specification:

‘international grade' 55-inch seat pitch – far more space than comparable classes;
21 inches of seat width between armrests, with 28 inches of personal space including the armrests;
13 inches of recline with extended leg and footrests;
plush off-white leather seats with soft upholstery and black armrest pods;
electronic recline control: intuitive, backlit switches with presets for take-off, comfort and relaxation;
headrests with large adjustable wings and height adjustment;
electronically-controlled lumbar support: with height and firmness adjustment at the touch of a button;
in-seat massage function;
independently adjustable leg & footrests;
personal reading lights, and
an in-arm dining table with size and position flexibility as well as a book holder mode.

Virgin America's main cabin will have a 141-seat configuration. Also manufactured by Recaro Aircraft Seating for Virgin America, main cabin seating was substantially customized to provide highly-coveted additional leg room. Specifically, the main cabin will have:

32-inch general seat pitch;
hidden under-floor electronics boxes, providing all seats an unobstructed foot well;
a seat structure with greater knee clearance than traditional seats at the same pitch;
19.7-inch average seat width (measured between the centerlines of two adjacent armrests);
5-inch average seat recline;
luxurious black leather, soft upholstery and hi-gloss white plastics;
headrests with adjustable wings as well as height and tilt adjustment;
enhanced lumbar support, and
contoured seat-pan structures, unlike the metal bars that can be felt through traditional seats.

Unique class dividers with a contemporary design separate the cabins in vibrant, transparent color, redefining the relationship between classes, transforming traditionally claustrophobic seat rows and reinforcing the lounge-like qualities of the cabin. This product was conceived and designed by Virgin America and engineered and manufactured by C&D Zodiac Inc.
A mini-bar at the rear of the aircraft provides guests a self-service station that will be loaded with products and refreshments from Virgin America's retail, food and drink partners. This product was conceived by Virgin America and co-designed, engineered and manufactured by Driessen AIS.
Unique main cabin lavatory locations (behind the aft doors) mean that no seated passenger is adjacent to a restroom. Virgin America will also feature a music selection in the lavatories.
The Red System
"The Red System is a comprehensive interactive environment where passengers are active participants in their entertainment experience – they truly can create, discover and enjoy their own in-flight experiences," says Charles Ogilvie, Virgin America's Director of In-flight Entertainment & Partnerships.
With a goal of giving the airline guest the control, Virgin America designed the Red System using a clean-slate design approach. Virgin America also developed the Red System so that it can operate effectively as a networked platform on launch and be able to interface effectively with external systems ranging from reservations systems to credit card processors to Virgin America's caterer. In addition, the entire Red System was designed to be compatible with broadband once it is introduced for use with seatback and passenger laptops in the future.
Special features of the Red System include:

meals on-demand with an in-flight shopping system, allowing passengers to order what they want, when they want it;
Hollywood pay-per-view movies provided by Virgin America partners including Disney, Fox, Paramount, Sony Pictures and Warner Brothers;
live satellite TV from Dish Network;
the first ever in-flight program guide (IPG) for live television, allowing guests to plan their time spent viewing entertainment more effectively;
games – a batch of open source games and an upcoming public invitation for savvy ground-based Linux game designers to try their hand designing games and in-flight applications for the Red System;
Virgin America Audio – an unprecedented audio experience with over 3,000 mp3 tracks and 20 radio channels, allowing guests to customize their playlists, to share playlists and take them with on future flights;
wireless access throughout the cabin, for passenger laptop and flight attendant handheld access, as well as for high-speed air-to-ground broadband connectivity in the future;
a "quicknav" application that provides a site map of the entire experience;
email and SMS messaging, that allows guests to send emails, SMS messages or chat with each other during the flight, and
an info/help feature that includes a response to the questions "Where are we? How much further?"

The Red System was brought to life by a team made up of CoKinetic, Wunderman's digital marketing team, IMS and Panasonic Avionics. CoKinetic and Panasonic coded and integrated software and Wunderman built Red's graphical user interface (GUI). Virgin America's IFE team also includes Anomaly, Inflight Canada, Pace Communications and Spafax, as well as content partners Disney, Echostar, Fox, Paramount and Warner Brothers.
"Every aspect of Virgin America's IFE Red System looks at both how a guest would use the system now and in the future. We wanted to make sure the system will grow with our guests and the predicted entry of broadband in airborne environments," remarked Mr. Ogilvie. "Real-time airborne connectivity exponentially increases the functionality we have built into this system. The richness of our guest offering more than doubles for every couple of kilobytes of an internet pipe we can make available to the computers we've installed at our guests' seats."
