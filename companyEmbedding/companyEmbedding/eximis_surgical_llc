The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Eximis Surgical raises $270,000 to develop new medical device

	Posted on April 13, 2015 by Miller Chase  - Bioscience, Entrepreneurs / Small Business, Health Care & Insurance, Technology, Today's News  

A Louisville-based startup, Eximis Surgical LLC, has raised $270,000 to aid in the development of a new medical device, though the founders are still keeping the nature of the new device under wraps.
The funding was disclosed in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A trio of former Covidien employees teamed up with a veteran of the aerospace and industrial realms last year to form Eximis.
Co-founder Kristin Johnson, one of the former Covidien employees, said Monday that she couldn’t disclose who participated in the funding round or when the company hopes to have its product to market. But she said the new funds would be used for development to further the prototype along.
Other co-founders include William Gregg, Donna Ford-Serbu and Dirk Johnson.
Kristin Johnson said the company is not a spinoff from Covidien, which was recently acquired by Medtronic, and is a totally separate venture. So far, three of the four founders are working on the venture full-time out of their homes.
