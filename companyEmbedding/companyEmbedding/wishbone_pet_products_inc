Executive Summary



CompanyWishbone Pet Products, Inc. is a start-up company that will design and market innovative pet products. This business plan has been developed to present Wishbone Pet Products, Inc. to prospective investors and assist in raising £120,000 of capital needed to begin production and launch our first product.MarketThe pet product industry is a large and expanding market. The most rapidly growing market segment is pet products and supplies, which represents 5.5% of the market. This segment is projected to increase from £5.2 billion to £6.9 billion in the next five years, according to the Business Communications Company Pet Industry study. The reason for this tremendous growth in pet products and supplies is the growing number of pet owners and pets.According to a recent survey conducted by the American Animal Hospital Association, there were approximately 235 million households which owned pets. These households represent about 60% of all U.S. households, and 40% of these households own more than one pet, according to an American Pet Product Manufacturers Association (APPMA) study. Of these pet owners and pets, there are approximately 43 million dog owners who owned 62 million dogs. Another recent study found that the average household with pets spent about £350 on their pets. The average American household spends more on pet food than it does on wine, over-the-counter drugs, candy, or television sets. It spends more on veterinary services than it does on coffee, books, video rentals, or computer software.NeedRecently dog owners have been criticized for leaving their dogs droppings in public places and on private property. Failure to retrieve dog waste is a matter of considerable concern due to public health risks, not to mention the inconvenience to the public. As a result, many communities have passed legislation requiring dog owners not only to clean up after their pet but also to carry a device for performing this task.According to a Ralston Purina pet owner study, dog owners cite cleaning up after their dog as one of the primary challenges of owning a dog. Unfortunately, currently available dog waste clean-up products are crudely designed and cumbersome to operate, leaving many dog owners frustrated and less inclined to clean up after their dog. To address the needs of dog owners and their communities, a simple, clean, effective means of accomplishing this task is needed.SolutionFetch™ is a unique dog waste clean up product designed so that the user's hands never contact the dog waste in any way. With a simple one-handed operation, Fetch™ encloses the dog waste in a bag inside of a sealed plastic case. Upon closing, the bag is automatically sealed. When Fetch™ is opened again, the liner bag and its contents are automatically discharged into a waste receptacle. Standard plastic liner bags can be deposited into an appropriate waste receptacle for disposal. Biodegradable liner bags can be deposited into a toilet for disposal. Its compact size makes it ideal for use when walking and the liner bag keeps the device from being contaminated.AdvantageWishbone Pet Products is positioned to address this market need with an innovative, patented product and a management team with extensive product design and marketing experience. We have spent ample time on the development and research of Fetch™ to ensure that it will satisfy the market demand for a simpler and more effective dog waste clean-up product.FinancialsResearch and development work to date has been self-funded by the principal. Based on detailed financial projections, if the company receives sufficient funding to launch Fetch™, it will operate profitably within the first year with a net profit.




1.1 Objectives
Develop a sustainable pet product business that designs, manufactures, and markets innovative pet products.Successfully bring Fetch™ to market by April Year 1.Achieve sales volume targets:Year 1: 25,000 scoops, 40,000 boxes of bags (25 bags/box)Year 2: 50,000 scoops, 175,000 boxes of bags (25 bags/box)Year 3: 100,000 scoops, 420,000 boxes of bags (25 bags/box)Reach break-even point within 12 months.
1.2 Mission
Wishbone Pet Products mission is to help people enjoy their pets by developing innovative products that address pet owners needs.
1.3 Keys to Success
Quality ProductsProduct sales are the primary income source for Wishbone Pet Products. To achieve sales goals, innovative products based on world-class industrial design, engineering, and manufacturing are essential.Strategic Niche MarketingWishbone Pet Products will market a small number of innovative products. Consumers in our targeted niche markets must be educated about their benefits in order for them to gain market acceptance and penetration. The marketing strategy must reflect this reality.Strategic PartnershipsWishbone Pet Products will rely on assistance from strategic partners to manufacture, deliver, and market products. The establishment and maintenance of these partnerships is crucial.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
