Dining & Nutrition
Dining and nutrition reflects the exceptional dining experience we consistently provide, serving meals that are not only delicious and varied, but also healthy and nutritionally optimized for the needs of our residents.
You've probably seen our executive chef Brad Miller on the Food Network or maybe even dined at one of his acclaimed Southern California restaurants.
These days you're just as likely to find him in the Five Star development kitchen working with our community chefs to create new signature recipes, perfect regional menus and dream up innovative ways to redefine senior dining.

Alzheimer's & Memory Care
Bridge to Rediscovery is Five Star Senior Living's innovative, award-winning approach to Alzheimer's and dementia care. The program helps those with Alzheimer's and other dementia-related challenges rediscover the joy in everyday life. Bridge to Rediscovery celebrates the spirit within each resident through personalized activities that encourage creativity and self-expression. We work with residents individually, striving for small successes that help create a sense of accomplishment.

Assisted Living
Assisted living residents are those who do not need 24-hour or complex medical supervision, but may need or want assistance with some aspects of daily life such as bathing and dressing, getting around, or medication reminders.
Independent Living
Independent Living is for seniors who are able to live on their own in an apartment or house, but who want the convenience of living within a community that provides services and amenities such as housekeeping, social activities, dining, transportation, and/or the option of assistance with daily tasks or medical care if they need it later. 
Personal Care 
In Personal Care communities, our staff provide assistance with daily tasks such as dressing, bathing, transportation, medication management. 

Rehabilitation & Wellness
Rehabilitation and Wellness services are designed to help you maintain and improve independence. We offer rehabilitation for: 

Short-term inpatient stays, often needed after surgical procedures
Home health care in our assisted living communities
Out-patient rehabilitation for adults of all ages
Long-term skilled nursing care residents

Respite Care / Short-term Stays
Respite Care / Short-term Stays are great for seniors when families travel out of town or simply need a break from the stresses of caregiving. They can also be a good option for those considering senior living and want to "try it out" before making a long-term commitment. Short-term stays allow residents to enjoy housekeeping services, community activities, dining, and all other amenities enjoyed by our permanent residents. In addition to the benefits of physical care, our short-term residents often make friendships that enrich life in a way that only connecting with others can. 

Skilled Nursing Care
Skilled Nursing Care is for those who need ongoing long-term nursing care or for those who need short-term concentrated rehabilitation while recovering from surgery or an illness. Five Star communities provide the sophisticated medical services and 24-hour supervision needed by residents with serious health challenges.

It also operates two rehabilitation hospitals with 321 beds located in Braintree and Woburn, MA, that are leased from SNH. Five Star was spun off from SNH in April 2000.

Five Star has lease agreements with SNH, and business agreements with RMR and SNH that give these two entities significant roles in Five Star's business, roles which are not anticipated to end anytime soon. SNH owns approximately 9% of Five Star's outstanding shares. The CEO and CFO, two Managing Directors, and other members of the administrative and technical staff of Five Star are also employees of RMR.

RMR manages Senior… MoreREIT Management & Research LLC (RMR), a privately held asset management company that manages over $17 billion worth of real estate assets, including more than 1,350 properties in 46 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico and Ontario, Canada. RMR manages Senior Housing Properties (NYSE:SNH), CommonWealth REIT (NYSE:CWH), Hospitality Properties Trust (NYSE: HPT), Government Properties Income Trust (NYSE: GOV), and provides services to Five Star Quality Care (NYSE: FVE) and TravelCenters of America LLC (NYSE: TA). It has approximately 650 employees.

Five Star Quality Care, Inc. operates senior living communities, including independent living communities, assisted living communities, and skilled nursing facilities. It also operates two rehabilitation hospitals with 321 beds located in Braintree and Woburn, MA, that are leased from SNH. Five Star was spun off from SNH in April 2000.

Five Star has lease agreements with SNH, and business agreements with RMR and SNH that give these two entities significant roles in Five Star's business, roles which are not anticipated to end anytime soon. SNH owns approximately 9% of Five Star's outstanding shares. The CEO and CFO, two Managing Directors, and other members of the administrative and technical staff of Five Star are also employees of RMR.

The executive IT management and much of the technical staff of Five Star Quality Care, Inc., works for REIT Management & Research (RMR), which shares its corporate offices in Watertown, MA, with Five Star. Consequently, the Chief Information Officer of Five Star has a dual role in running IT both for Five Star and RMR.

While RMR's 650 employees, and the systems they use, support property management activities, the systems at Five Star have to be more versatile because Five Star not only has property management operations, it runs two rehabilitation hospitals, five institutional pharmacies, over a dozen outpatient clinics. 

The CIO delegates much of the day to day management of this varied technology landscape to the IT Operations Director, while carving out the network engineering and operations tasks associated with the many sites and data center to the Network Engineering Director. Managers have specific responsibility for telecommunications, and hospital systems. 

The general management of Five Star facilities come under the responsibility of regional business executives, and small office staffs that take care of the computers. IT services like the Help Desk are offered by the corporate IT staff in Massachusetts. 

RMR's Business Services Manager doubles as the IT purchasing agent for Five Star, although some of the IT sourcing for infrastructure projects is done by a systems engineer. Five Star Quality Care Inc. also oversees the IT operations for RMR Funds.

 NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Five Star Senior Living Inc. (Nasdaq: FVE) today announced its financial
      results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.
    

Bruce Mackey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Five Star, made
      the following statement:
    

      “During the quarter, we continued to make progress with our operating
      initiatives that are intended to improve occupancy, ancillary revenues
      and cash flows from our senior living communities. Despite the recent
      increased amount of competition in the senior living industry, we are
      pleased that our occupancy rate remained stable between the third and
      fourth quarters of 2016. Also during the quarter, we began operating
      seven new senior living communities with a combined 521 living units.
      Subsequent to the quarter's end, we entered into a new $100 million
      secured revolving credit facility which replaced our prior facility that
      was scheduled to expire in April 2017. This new credit facility adds
      liquidity to our already conservative balance sheet.
    

      “In addition, we are pleased to announce we have changed our name to
      Five Star Senior Living Inc. In 2001 we started the company with a focus
      on clinical care, but we have evolved into a full service healthcare,
      hospitality and senior lifestyle services company. Our new name helps
      bring alignment to our evolved business.”
    

Financial Results for the quarter ended December 31,
      2016:



        Senior living revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased 0.8% to
        $279.0 million from $281.2 million for 2015. The decline in senior
        living revenue is a result of decreases in occupancy, partially offset
        by an increase in average monthly rates to residents who pay privately
        for services. Management fee revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016
        increased 21.7% to $3.4 million from $2.8 million for 2015. Growth in
        management fees was primarily due to the previously disclosed
        modifications to Five Star's management and pooling arrangements with
        Senior Housing Properties Trust, or SNH, that became effective on July
        1, 2016 and to an increase in the number of Five Star's managed
        communities compared to 2015.
      

        Loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 was
        $6.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to loss from
        continuing operations of $6.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for
        2015. Loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016
        included benefits from income taxes of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per
        diluted share, related to a reduction of previously accrued estimated
        state tax expense. Loss from continuing operations for the fourth
        quarter of 2015 included the previously disclosed litigation
        settlement charge of $4.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, and
        employee termination costs of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.
      

        Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $5.6 million, or $0.11 per
        diluted share, compared to net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.13 per
        diluted share, for 2015. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016
        included income from discontinued operations of $0.3 million. As of
        December 31, 2016, we have no senior living communities classified as
        held for sale.
      

        Earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes,
        depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter of
        2016 was $3.5 million compared to $4.2 million for 2015. EBITDA,
        excluding certain items noted in the supplemental information provided
        below, or Adjusted EBITDA, was $3.5 million and $9.5 million for the
        fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. A reconciliation of
        loss from continuing operations determined in accordance with U.S.
        generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to EBITDA and
        Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
        appears later in this press release.
      


Operating Results for the quarter ended December 31,
      2016:



        Occupancy at owned and leased senior living communities for the fourth
        quarter of 2016 was 83.9%. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016,
        the calculation of occupancy includes only living units categorized as
        in service; occupancy calculations for periods prior to 2016 included
        certain living units categorized as out of service.
      

        The average monthly rate at owned and leased senior living communities
        for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 1.4% to $4,639 from $4,577
        for 2015.
      

        The percentage of revenue derived from residents’ private resources at
        owned and leased senior living communities for the fourth quarter of
        2016 decreased 40 basis points to 77.6% from 78.0% for 2015.
      


Financial Results for the year ended December 31, 2016:



        Senior living revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased
        0.1% to $1.12 billion from $1.11 billion for 2015. Growth in senior
        living revenue was the result of increases in average monthly rates to
        residents who pay privately for services, a $1.0 million reversal in
        revenue reserves recorded in 2016 as a result of the final settlement
        amount with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
        the Inspector General resulting from the previously disclosed Medicare
        compliance assessment at one of Five Star's skilled nursing
        facilities, or the Compliance Assessment, being less than the
        previously estimated amount, a revenue reserve recorded in 2015 of
        $2.4 million related to the Compliance Assessment and the acquisition
        of two senior living communities during the fourth quarter of 2015,
        partially offset by a decrease in occupancy at comparable senior
        living communities. Management fee revenue for the year ended
        December 31, 2016 increased by 15.1% to $12.4 million from $10.7
        million for 2015. Growth in management fees was primarily due to the
        previously disclosed modifications to Five Star's management and
        pooling arrangements with SNH that became effective on July 1, 2016
        and to an increase in the number of Five Star's managed communities
        compared to 2015.
      

        Loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016
        was $22.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to loss from
        continuing operations of $40.8 million, or $0.84 per diluted share,
        for 2015. Loss from continuing operations for the year ended
        December 31, 2016 included a $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share,
        reversal in revenue reserves and accrued liability for estimated
        penalties related to the Compliance Assessment and a provision for
        income taxes of $2.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, resulting
        primarily from state tax expense. Loss from continuing operations for
        the year ended December 31, 2015 included a non-cash charge for
        goodwill impairment of $25.3 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, a
        revenue reserve of $2.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and
        penalties, compliance costs and professional fees of $4.8 million, or
        $0.10 per diluted share, resulting primarily from the Compliance
        Assessment, a previously disclosed litigation settlement charge of
        $4.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, and employee termination
        costs of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, partially offset by
        a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per
        diluted share.
      

        Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $21.8 million, or
        $0.45 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $43.1 million, or
        $0.89 per diluted share, for 2015. Net loss for the years ended
        December 31, 2016 and 2015 included income from discontinued
        operations of $0.2 million and loss from discontinued operations of
        $2.3 million, respectively.
      

        EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $22.3 million compared
        to negative $2.3 million for 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.8 million
        and $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
        respectively. A reconciliation of loss from continuing operations
        determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for
        the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 appears later in this press
        release.
      


Expansion and Disposition Activities:


      In October 2016, Five Star entered into an agreement to acquire an
      assisted living community, located in Illinois, with 63 living units for
      $7.9 million. Five Star terminated this agreement during the fourth
      quarter of 2016.
    

      In December 2016, Five Star began leasing from SNH two senior living
      communities that SNH acquired, located in Illinois, with a combined 126
      living units. These communities were added to one of Five Star's leases
      with SNH and Five Star's annual rent payable to SNH increased by $1.4
      million in accordance with the terms of that lease.
    

      In December 2016, Five Star began managing for the account of SNH five
      senior living communities that SNH owns, located in Georgia, with a
      combined 395 living units. Five Star and SNH entered into management
      agreements for each of these communities on terms substantially similar
      to those of existing management agreements between Five Star and SNH,
      and these management agreements were added to existing or new pooling
      agreements between Five Star and SNH.
    

Financing Activities:


      In February 2017, Five Star entered into a new $100 million secured
      revolving credit facility with terms substantially similar to those of
      its previously existing secured revolving credit facility, which the new
      facility replaced. The new credit facility matures in February 2020,
      and, subject to Five Star’s payment of extension fees and meeting other
      conditions, Five Star has options to extend the stated maturity date of
      the new credit facility for two, one year periods. Five Star pays
      interest on borrowings under the new credit facility at an annual rate
      of LIBOR plus a premium of 250 basis points. The new credit facility is
      secured by real estate mortgages on 10 senior living communities with a
      combined 1,219 living units owned by Five Star's guarantor subsidiaries
      and those guarantor subsidiaries’ accounts receivable and related
      collateral.
    

Other:


      Effective March 3, 2017, Five Star changed its name from “Five Star
      Quality Care, Inc.” to “Five Star Senior Living Inc.” This name change
      reflects Five Star's current business focus on not just providing high
      quality clinical care but also providing hospitality, various amenities
      and personalized services to enhance the lifestyle of its residents.
      Five Star's common shares will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Stock
      Market LLC under the symbol "FVE".

      WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
    

      THIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING
      STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
      REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. ALSO, WHENEVER FIVE STAR
      USES WORDS SUCH AS “BELIEVE”, “EXPECT”, “ANTICIPATE”, “INTEND”, “PLAN”,
      “ESTIMATE”, "WILL", “MAY” AND NEGATIVES OR DERIVATIVES OF THESE OR
      SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, FIVE STAR IS MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.
      THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON FIVE STAR’S PRESENT
      INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT
      GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER
      MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY FIVE STAR’S FORWARD
      LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE:
    


        FIVE STAR'S ABILITY TO OPERATE NEW SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES
        PROFITABLY DEPENDS UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING FIVE STAR'S ABILITY TO
        INTEGRATE NEW COMMUNITIES INTO ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS
        SOME FACTORS WHICH ARE BEYOND FIVE STAR'S CONTROL, SUCH AS THE DEMAND
        FOR FIVE STAR'S SERVICES ARISING FROM ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY
        AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PROVIDERS OF SENIOR LIVING SERVICES. FIVE
        STAR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE, OPERATE AND PROFITABLY
        MANAGE THE NEW SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT FIVE STAR BEGAN TO
        OPERATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016.
      

        STATEMENTS IN THIS PRESS RELEASE REGARDING FIVE STAR HAVING OBTAINED A
        REPLACEMENT SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND MR. MACKEY’S STATEMENTS THAT
        THIS FACILITY ADDS LIQUIDITY TO FIVE STAR’S ALREADY CONSERVATIVE
        BALANCE SHEET MAY IMPLY THAT FIVE STAR HAS SUFFICIENT CASH LIQUIDITY.
        HOWEVER, FIVE STAR’S OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT
        AMOUNTS OF WORKING CASH AND REQUIRE IT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL
        EXPENDITURES TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, FIVE STAR
        MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH LIQUIDITY.
      

        FIVE STAR’S OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NEW CREDIT
        FACILITY ARE SUBJECT TO FIVE STAR’S PAYMENT OF EXTENSION FEES AND
        MEETING OTHER CONDITIONS, BUT THE APPLICABLE CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE MET.
      

        THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE NEW CREDIT FACILITY IS
        SUBJECT TO FIVE STAR HAVING QUALIFIED COLLATERAL, WHICH IS PRIMARILY
        BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS SECURING FIVE STAR’S OBLIGATIONS

      FIVE STAR SENIOR LIVING INC.RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL
      MEASURES(in thousands)(unaudited)


      Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures that are not
      determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles, or GAAP. Five Star considers these Non-GAAP financial
      measures to be meaningful supplemental disclosures because it believes
      that the presentation of these Non-GAAP financial measures may help
      investors to gain a better understanding of changes in Five Star’s
      operating results and its ability to pay rent or service debt, make
      capital expenditures and expand its business. These Non-GAAP financial
      measures also may help investors who wish to make comparisons between
      Five Star and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.
    

      The Non-GAAP financial measures presented are used by management to
      evaluate Five Star’s financial performance and for comparing Five Star’s
      performance over time and to the performance of its competitors. This
      supplemental information should not be considered as an alternative to
      income (loss) from continuing operations or net income (loss), as an
      indicator of Five Star’s operating performance or as a measure of Five
      Star’s liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Five Star
      may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other companies
    

      Five Star believes that income (loss) from continuing operations is the
      most directly comparable financial measure determined according to GAAP
      to Five Star’s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The following
      table presents the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures
      to loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable
      financial measure under GAAP reported in Five Star’s condensed
      consolidated financial statements, for the three months and years ended
      December 31, 2016 and 2015.

      by the sale in September 2016 of one community we leased from SNH that
      was not classified as held for sale; separate comparable senior living
      community financial data is not presented because the differences
      between that data and the data for all owned and leased communities are
      not material.(3) 2016 data presents the seven communities that
      were sold to SNH as part of the June 2016 sale and leaseback
      transaction as leased for the entire 2016 periods presented; 2015 data
      presents those communities as owned.(4) Skilled nursing facility
      revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $1.0 million
      reversal in revenue reserves related to the Compliance Assessment.
      Skilled nursing facility revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015
      includes a $2.4 million revenue reserve related to the Compliance
      Assessment.(5) Other senior living revenue and expenses primarily
      relate to rehabilitation and other specialty service revenues and
      expenses provided at owned and leased senior living communities.(6)
      Continuing care retirement community other operating expenses for the
      three months and year ended December 31, 2015 includes a $4.2 million
      litigation settlement charge related to a litigation matter.(7)
      Skilled nursing facility other operating expenses for the year ended
      December 31, 2016 includes a $0.5 million reversal in accrued liability
      for estimated penalties related to the Compliance Assessment. Skilled
      nursing facility other operating expenses for the three months and year
      ended December 31, 2015 includes a $0.3 million reversal of previously
      accrued reserve and $4.2 million expense, respectively, related to
      estimated penalties, compliance costs and professional fees for the
      Compliance Assessment.
