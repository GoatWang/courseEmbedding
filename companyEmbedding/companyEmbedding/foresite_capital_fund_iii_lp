We are a trusted financial partner with a structure that allows us to partner with portfolio company management to develop complete financing solutions in both private and public markets. ​​​​​​
We invest in emerging leaders across all areas of healthcare including therapeutics, medical devices, diagnostics, and services. Our focus is on the development and commercialization of transformative products that address what we believe are the most critical, unmet healthcare needs.


        How We're Different
      



  We are a financial partner at all stages – venture and post-venture, private, and public – partnering at the point where we believe we can make the biggest impact.


  We function as a team, participating together in primary diligence and sharing collective ownership of our investment and portfolio management decisions. Our collaborative team culture allows us to bring an array of unique perspectives and evaluate situations efficiently and effectively.


  We provide a depth and breadth of insights and best practices, from our experience with hundreds of companies, to each of our ventures.


  We have powerful, high-quality networks and deep experience across areas of healthcare including marketing, sales, business development, research and development, regulatory, policy, and communications.






          The healthcare sector is experiencing unprecedented innovation driven by understanding vast amounts of biologic and genetic information; a change we believe is leading to some of the most impactful medical solutions in decades. Innovation is increasingly focused on improving care and reducing costs. Our passion is to use our capital and networks to help build transformative healthcare companies and build a portfolio of companies that significantly impact the quality and effectiveness of the U.S. healthcare system.

About Foresite





What We Do





We provide growth capital to emerging healthcare leaders with disruptive products and services, with the goal of transforming patient care.

Foresite Capital’s goal is to help portfolio companies grow from proof-of-concept to revenue growth and profitability. Foresite Capital provides strategic insight, creativity, drive, and networks of high-value professionals, in addition to capital to its portfolio companies.
 
We built Foresite with a deep, multidisciplinary, and highly experienced team in order to optimize sourcing, evaluation, and growth acceleration. With more than $1B in assets under management as of June 2016, we apply insight, creativity and drive to earn the trust of our portfolio companies.







How We Work





Our investment team possesses more than 130 years of collective experience in the healthcare and investment industries.
We believe this broad and deep experience has produced a best-in-class network of contacts to help our portfolio companies accelerate growth. Internally, our team functions collaboratively, with each member of the team participating at all stages of the investment process.
Foresite Capital’s due diligence and decision-making process is structured to understand and help portfolio companies mitigate key technical, regulatory, execution, and competitive risks.

What are analysts saying about Aerie Pharmaceuticals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Aerie Pharmaceuticals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Aerie’s efforts on developing two late-stage candidates – Rhopressa and Roclatan – are encouraging. The company resubmitted new drug application (NDA) for lead candidate Rhopressa in Feb 2017. The FDA determined that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and set the PDUFA goal date for the completion of review as Feb 28, 2018. Aerie had earlier withdrawn its NDA that was filed in September as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL was not ready for pre-approval inspection by the FDA. A potential approval and successful commercialization will significantly boost the company’s growth prospects in the global ophthalmic market. The recent data on Roclatan is also positive. Moreover, Aerie’s shares have outperformed the industry in the year so far. However, with no approved product in its portfolio, Aerie depends heavily on a potential approval of Rhopressa." (7/24/2017)
2. HC Wainwright analysts commented, "Blueprint reported a Q1 net loss of $28MM and ended the quarter with $452MM." (5/3/2017)
3. Aegis analysts commented, "We still consider the upcoming Mercury 2 three-month efficacy readout for Roclatan expected before the end of Q2, 2017 as being a potentially share moving event. Higher patients dropout rate seen in Rhopressa arm relative to Timolol arm is not concerning to us. 30% of the patients in the Rhopressa arm of the trial discontinued treatment by month 6 compared to 12% of the patient population in the Timolol arm. The most common reason for discontinuation seen in the Rhopressa arm was related to adverse events, at about 19.4%. 2.2% (8) of the subjects in the Timolol arm dropped out due to adverse events. As a point of reference, given that 47% of patients (118 out of 251 patients) on Rhopressa QD completed the treatment by month 12 in Rocket 2, we estimate a maximum drop-off rate of Rhopressa at 53%. Further, according to results published in Persistency: A New Take on Patient Care" by Schwartz in Review of Ophthalmology 11.4 (2004): 108, the discontinuation rates of 66%/50%/46% for Latanoprost/Travoprost/Bimatoprost were seen at month 3 and 6, with rates increasing to 67%/81%/81%, respectively, at month 12." (4/13/2017)
4. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, " AERI reported 4Q16 financials and updated ongoing Rhopressa and Roclatan development activities. The Rhopressa NDA was refiled in late Feb following an issue at the third party manufacturer. AERI expects a potential PDUFA in 1Q18 after a standard FDA review and is in the process of building a commercial org in anticipation of a 1H18 product launch. Key data from both Rhopressa and Roclatan are expected in 2Q17: top-line safety data from the ph 3 ROCKET-4 trial and top-line efficacy data from the ph 3 MERCURY-2 trial. AERI expects to file an NDA for Roclatan in late 2017/early 2018. We maintain our Buy rating and slightly adjust our $PT to $58 (from $52) to reflect a model and valuation update." (3/8/2017)
5. Brean Capital analysts commented, "At yesterday’s investor day, Aerie painted a clearer portrait of the current standard of care and competitive glaucoma treatment environment. Management also provided further insight into the recent Mercury 1 data for Roclatan, a closer look at how to measure the effectiveness of glaucoma treatment with added perspective from a former physician, as well as revisited what the company’s future value adding drivers will be and articulated the international strategy. We took the opportunity to dive deeper into our model, taking into account potential future European launches and Japanese clinical trials." (10/6/2016)
