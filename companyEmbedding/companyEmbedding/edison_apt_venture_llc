Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale.

I have lived at 55 Glenwood Avenue, East Orange, New Jersey 07017, one of Shamco Management properties, for little over two years as a tenant.  My apartment is very nice and it is very quiet on my floor, which I love!  If I have any repair issues, I can call the 24 hr hotline number or the Property Manager and she will make sure my repairs get completed within a timely manner.In the recent past, there were things I did not like as a tenant and I communicated that to Management.  In those instances, it is my impression they listened intently to my complaints and addressed those matters expeditiously.  Over a short course of time, I have watched the Management improved our living situation within weeks ( i.e., mounting new cameras on each floor so tenants can feel safer and packages can be left at the door;  installing new carpeting in the hallways of each floor, which makes a world of a difference in the feel and aesthetics of the overall building; set-up an onsite free business center equipped with computers for Tenant use; open a free state of the art gym where tenants can work out safely and conveniently; a new lighting system for the parking lot has also been installed allowing for a brighter area and a deterrent to predators, in conjunction to installing new lights for the back exit area near the garbage acting as an added preventative to criminals and the many other new exciting things they will be doing in the near future.  By making these improvements, Management is showing me as a tenant that they care about their tenants safety and enjoyment.  This makes me want to stay here indefinitely.  I would definitely recommend this building to potential new tenants.Innovation Accounting & Tax Services PCDavid W. ratedI have never been so wonderfully taken care of for any service for which I’ve paid than with Innovation Accounting & Tax Services! From the moment I contacted until after my taxes were prepared and filed, the level of service was superb. I was informed every step of the way, provided various methods of communication, a secured file repository, and basically provided everything on a silver platter so that my taxes could be taken care of in a timely manner. There were no stacks of repetitive forms to fill out, no legalese, and no leaving me guessing. I heartily recommend Innovation Accounting & Tax Services to anyone abroad  and at home (U.S.A) that needs assistance in getting their taxes filed properly and in a timely manner.Innovation Accounting & Tax Services PCDanial M. ratedI have been working with Mona over 2 years on returns and complex expat issues. I have to say that she has been absolutely fantastic the whole way through. She was extremely fast at coming back to me, with accurate responses, in-depth explanations and valuable advice. She has been a fantastic support and I could totally rely on her. She was committed to the deadlines and was working even on weekends for us to ensure she would deliver on time. It was a real pleasure to work with her and I can only praise her efforts, professionalism, dedication, patience and kindness. It is not often we get the opportunity to work with someone so good! Thank you Mona  and Innovation Accounting & Tax Services for everything!Innovation Accounting & Tax Services PCChris B. ratedExcellent service and results! Absolutely “painless” experience. I know all you expats out there understand what I’m saying with how complicated our taxes can get. All I had to do was provide the info Mona asked for and a couple more emails from her confirming the info and a few more questions and I just kicked back and she did all the work. I received two returns that ended up being very substantial. Thank you Mona and Innovation Accounting & Tax Services for the very professional yet personal service! I will definitely be a return customer and highly recommend your service!Shamco Management CorpDeserene D. ratedI've lived at 2110 Newkirk for 4+ years and the experience so far has been very good, we're happy with our apartment, the management team at Shamco, the super and the maintenance staff at my location.Key improvements to the lobby area, elevator, intercom system, tenant appreciation day in the lobby is all good and encourages a community atmosphere.  Shamco is very responsive to address issues, willing to listen and act. My only concern is the laundry room could use some improvements/updating.Shamco Management CorpGeorgia T. ratedMy take is different.  They've improved security, upgrades, &  reach out to tenants.  Heat is better.

"Mike was fantastic! He contacted me to inform me of completion of the job, and explained why and how the tasks were performed. Very helpful!"
    - Chanelle


"Both service requests were completed within one day which only required the service tech to make one trip out and only one time entering our home. Molding looks great. Tech was super neat. Would never have known he was here. Place looked the same as when we left it."
    - Karen


"We are very pleased with the Service person's services!"

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
