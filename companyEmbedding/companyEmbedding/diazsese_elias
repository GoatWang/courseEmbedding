                    OAKVILLE, Ont. - The Burger King executive in charge of the fast food chain's expansion in Asia was named Monday to take over the reins at Tim Hortons.
                                    
                                The company named Elias Diaz Sese as president for Tim Hortons Brand following the takeover of the company by Burger King last week in a more than $12-billion stock and cash deal.



Diaz Sese replaces Tim Hortons chief executive Marc Caira, who moves to the role of vice-chairman of Restaurant Brands International (TSX:QSR), the new name of the combined company, following the acquisition of the Canadian coffee and doughnut chain.



Daniel Schwartz was named Restaurant Brands chief executive.
Diaz Sese, most recently president for Burger King Asia Pacific, is expected to move with his family from Singapore to Oakville, Ont., as he takes on his new job.



Also announced Monday was the appointment of David Clanachan as president and chief operating officer for Tim Hortons Canada. He has been chief operating officer at Tim Hortons since August 2012.
Mike Meilleur was appointed president for Tim Hortons U.S. He was executive vice-president, Tim Hortons U.S.A., before the merger.



Burger King closed its takeover of Tim Hortons Inc. on Friday.

Petition ClosedPetitioning  Elías Díaz SeséDecision makersElías Díaz SeséTim Hortons - Please Add Vegan Options to the MenuRenee Gosse Mt pearl, CanadaRenee GosseMt pearl, Canada23,314SupportersDear Mr. Elías Díaz Sesé (President, Tim Hortons);
Tim Hortons have been serving Canadians since May 17, 1964; and since then, has become a household name across the the country. Canadians rely on the convenience, taste, and comfort of this brand. 
The name Tim Hortons resonates with people because of the community involvement and the care that this company provides to those who need it. Tim Hortons gives back to the community through these wonderful foundations and events:
Tim Horton Children’s Foundation Camp DayTimbits Minor SportsAnd the famous Smile CookieThe customers of Tim Hortons recognize the support and advocacy that your company provides to help sustain strong communities. However, there is one large gap that I would like to address in the company, and that is the lack of vegan options on the menu. Veganism a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. It is 2016, and there are a TON of milk, egg, and cheese alternatives. Keep in mind that there are numerous Canadians who are also lactose intolerant and can not consume dairy products. My request to Tim Hortons is that you provide all Canadians with the opportunity to enjoy a warm cup of coffee or snack, vegans included. Warm Regards,  Hopeful Customers Across Canada  This petition was delivered to:Elías Díaz SeséRead the letterLetter toElías Díaz SeséTim Horton's Please Add Vegan Option's to the MenuOKRenee Gosse started this petition with a single signature, and now has 23,314 supporters.

Tim Hortons makes history in Glasgow as first UK and European restaurant opens

 RBI chief executive Daniel Schwartz will take over Sese's responsibilities, working with the president of Tim Hortons Canada to continue growing the chain. RBI is looking to expand all three of its restaurant brands internationally. Tim Hortons opened its first UK and European shop in Glasgow's Argyle Street earlier this month , with Sese on hand to oversee the event. An application has been put forward for a second cafe in the city on the site of the old Ann Summers store in Sauchiehall Street. The announcement about the management re-shuffle came on the same day as a group of Tim Hortons franchisees filed a class-action lawsuit in Canada against RBI, alleging breach of contract. The group claims RBI has been using money from the Tim Hortons advertising fund – which is collected from franchisees – for other operations within RBI that are not related to Tim Hortons. RBI has denied the allegations.

Under the terms of the agreement, Seven Invest will be the exclusive Tim Hortons area representative in Cincinnati, responsible for managing the market and sourcing third-party franchisees to develop more than 150 Tim Hortons restaurants over the next 10 years, according to a company press release."We are very excited to announce our aggressive expansion efforts in Cincinnati, a market close to our core Tim Hortons markets and where we think the brand and product offerings will strongly resonate with guests," said Elías Díaz Sesé, president of Tim Hortons. "Cincinnati boasts a fast-growing economy and is home to many large corporate headquarters and universities.""Furthermore, in Seven Invest we have a strong operator with meaningful franchise experience that is fully committed to propelling Tim Hortons development in the U.S.," continued Díaz Sesé. "Seven Invest will work with local entrepreneurs and prospective franchisees to grow the Tim Hortons presence in the Cincinnati area. This marks the first accelerated expansion agreement for Tim Hortons since the creation of RBI in December 2014, and reflects the model that we expect to use going forward as we rapidly expand the presence of the brand in the largest QSR market in the world."Tim Hortons opened its first restaurant in the U.S. in 1984 and its first restaurant in Ohio in 1996, the release stated. Today, the brand maintains restaurants across Canada, the U.S. and the Gulf Cooperation Council, with U.S. restaurants primarily located in Michigan, Ohio and New York."We are confident that this agreement will accelerate our expansion of Tim Hortons in the U.S., further bolstering the system-wide growth and solid results for both of RBI's iconic brands, Tim Hortons and Burger King," said Daniel Schwartz, CEO of RBI.Restaurant Brands International, owner of Tim Hortons and Burger King, operates more than 19,000 restaurants in approximately 100 countries and U.S. territories.Tim Hortons has more than 4,700 restaurants in Canada, the U.S. and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Topics: Food & Beverage, Franchising & GrowthSponsored Links:Related ContentTim Hortons-RBI battle heats upWill menu-labeling requirements be delayed — again?McDonald's France intros burger by 'la McFork'The plant-based burger that 'bleeds' like rare beefLatest ContentChipotle and the 'elephant in the dining room'In pictures: Global restaurant execs in London: Part 1Brand resurrection?
