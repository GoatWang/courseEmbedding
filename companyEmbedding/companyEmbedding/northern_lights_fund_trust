Investment Company Act of 1940 – Section 12(d)(1)(G) and Rule 12d1-2


RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL	
DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT


      June 29, 2015Our Ref. No. 20156291137
      Northern Lights Fund Trust
      File No. 811-21720




	Our response to your letter, dated June 29, 2015, provides assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) if a fund of funds in the same group of investment companies invests a portion of its assets in investments that might not be securities, consistent with its investment objectives, policies and restrictions.

	Specifically, your letter requests assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) against Grant Park Multi Alternative Strategies Fund, a series of Northern Lights Fund Trust (“Trust,” and the series, “Fund of Funds”), an open-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act, that invests in another series of the Trust in the same group of investment companies, as defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the 1940 Act,[1] as the Fund of Funds (“Underlying Fund”), if the arrangement meets all of the provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act and Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act, except for Rule 12d1-2(a)(2) to the extent that it restricts the Fund of Funds from investing in assets that might not be securities as defined in Section 2(a)(36) of the 1940 Act.
I.  BACKGROUND

	You represent as follows:

Dearborn Capital Management, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company and an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, serves as investment adviser to the Fund of Funds and the Underlying Funds. The Fund of Funds’ investment objectives, policies and restrictions allow it to invest in the Underlying Funds as well as in various other assets that may or may not be securities under the 1940 Act.
The Fund of Funds purchases shares of the Underlying Funds, and the Underlying Funds sell their shares to the Fund of Funds, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act and Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act.[2] Section 12(d)(1)(G) and Rule 12d1-2 do not provide for the Fund of Funds to invest in assets that might not be securities under the 1940 Act.


Your letter requests assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the 1940 Act against the Fund of Funds or an Underlying Fund if the Fund of Funds’ investment in the Underlying Funds meets all of the provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act and Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act, except for Rule 12d1-2(a)(2) to the extent that it restricts the Fund of Funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the 1940 Act.[3]

II.  ANALYSIS

	Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits the Fund of Funds from purchasing or otherwise acquiring securities issued by an Underlying Fund if immediately after the acquisition the Fund of Funds owns more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of the Underlying Fund, has more than 5% of its total assets invested in the Underlying Fund, or has more than 10% of its total assets invested in the Underlying Fund and all other investment companies. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits an Underlying Fund from knowingly selling its securities to the Fund of Funds if the sale will cause the Fund of Funds to own more than 3% of the Underlying Fund’s total outstanding voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the Underlying Fund’s total outstanding voting stock to be owned by investment companies. Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) were designed to prevent certain abuses that might arise when investment companies invest in other investment companies. Such potential abuses generally include the pyramiding of control and undue influence, the layering of fees, and complex fund of funds structures that are difficult for investors to understand.[4]

	Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, provides a conditional exemption from the limits in Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) for certain fund of funds arrangements within the same group of investment companies, such as the Fund of Funds. One of the conditions in Section 12(d)(1)(G), which was enacted in 1996,[5] limited a fund of funds’ other investments to Government securities and short-term paper. In 2006, the Commission adopted Rule 12d1-2 to permit a fund of funds relying on Section 12(d)(1)(G) to invest, among other things, in any types of securities that are consistent with its investment policies.[6] The Commission noted that allowing such greater flexibility for a fund of funds to meet its investment objectives did not present any additional concerns that Section 12(d)(1)(G) was intended to address.[7]

	In 2008, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 12d1-2 to permit, among other things, a fund of funds relying on Section 12(d)(1)(G) to invest in assets, such as real estate, futures contracts, and other financial instruments, that might not qualify as securities under the 1940 Act.[8] The Commission noted that it had issued exemptive orders providing such relief and that such greater flexibility did not appear to present any additional concerns that Section 12(d)(1)(G) was intended to address.[9] The larger rulemaking of which the proposed amendments to Rule 12d1-2 were a part remains on the Commission’s Regulatory Flexibility Agenda as a potential rule re-proposal.[10] The Commission has continued to issue exemptive orders providing the relief that would have been codified in the Rule 12d1-2 amendments. The Commission has conditioned such exemptive orders on compliance with all of the provisions of Rule 12d1-2 except for paragraph (a)(2) to the extent that it restricts a fund of funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the 1940 Act.[11]   

	Consistent with the rationale behind these exemptive orders and the Commission’s proposed amendments to Rule 12d1-2, you request assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the 1940 Act against the Fund of Funds or an Underlying Fund if the arrangement meets all of the provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act and Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act, except for Rule 12d1-2(a)(2) to the extent that it restricts the Fund of Funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the 1940 Act.

III.  CONCLUSION 
Based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter, and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the 1940 Act against the Fund of Funds or an Underlying Fund if the arrangement meets all of the provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act and Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act, except for Rule 12d1-2(a)(2) to the extent that it restricts the Fund of Funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the 1940 Act. This response expresses our views on enforcement action only and does not express any legal or interpretive conclusion on the issues presented. Because our position is based upon the facts and representations made in your letter, any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.

	Robert Shapiro 
	Senior Counsel




[1]  Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the 1940 Act defines a “group of investment companies” as “any 2 or more registered investment companies that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services.” 



[2]  Section 12(d)(1)(G), in relevant part, provides an exemption from Sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) for “securities of a registered open-end investment company or a registered unit investment trust (hereafter in this subparagraph referred to as the ‘acquired company’) purchased or otherwise acquired by a registered open-end investment company or a registered unit investment trust (hereafter in this subparagraph referred to as the ‘acquiring company’) if (I) the acquired company and the acquiring company are part of the same group of investment companies; (II) the securities of the acquired company, securities of other registered open-end investment companies and registered unit investment trusts that are part of the same group of investment companies, Government securities, and short-term paper are the only investments held by the acquiring company; (III) with respect to (aa) securities of the acquired company, the acquiring company does not pay and is not assessed any charges or fees for distribution-related activities, unless the acquiring company does not charge a sales load or other fees or charges for distribution-related activities; or (bb) securities of the acquiring company, any sales loads and other distribution-related fees charged, when aggregated with any sales load and distribution-related fees paid by the acquiring company with respect to securities of the acquired company, are not excessive under rules adopted pursuant to section 22(b) or section 22(c) by a securities association registered under section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Commission; [and] (IV) the acquired company has a policy that prohibits it from acquiring any securities of registered open-end investment companies or registered unit investment trusts in reliance on this subparagraph or subparagraph (F).” Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act provides an exemption for investment companies relying on Section 12(d)(1)(G) to acquire certain securities other than those referenced in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(II).	



[3] The term “security” is defined in Section 2(a)(36) of the 1940 Act.


[4] See, e.g., Public Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth, H.R. Rep. No. 2337, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 312-324 (1966). 



[5] National Securities Markets Improvements Act, Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (1996).



[6] Fund of Funds Investments, Investment Company Act Release No. 27399 (June 20, 2006) (“Adopting Release”). Prior to the adoption of Rule 12d1-2, the Commission had granted exemptive orders permitting a fund of funds relying on Section 12(d)(1)(G) to invest also in other securities and financial instruments. See, e.g., MPAM Funds Trust, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 24593 (Aug. 3, 2000) (notice) and 24624 (Aug. 29, 2000) (order); Bond Fund Series, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 23265 (June 23, 1998) (notice) and 23324 (July 21, 1998) (order).



[7] Adopting Release at n.61 and accompanying text.



[8] Exchange-Traded Funds, Investment Company Act Release No. 28193 (March 11, 2008).



[9] Id. at n.259 and accompanying text.



[10] Spring 2015 Unified Agenda, available at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201504&RIN=3235-AJ60. The commenters supported the proposed amendment to Rule 12d1-2.



[11] See, e.g., SSgA Mastertrust and SSgA Funds Management, Inc., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 31249 (Sept. 11, 2014) (notice) and 31278 (Oct. 07, 2014) (order); Goldman Sachs Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 30471 (April 19, 2013) (notice) and 30522 (May 15, 2013) (order); and Ivy Funds Variable Insurance Portfolios, et al., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 30427 (March 15, 2013) (notice) and 30458 (April 10, 2013) (order).

SEC Charges Gatekeepers of Two Mutual Fund Trusts for Inaccurate Disclosures About Decisions On Behalf of Shareholders
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          2013-78
        

          Washington, D.C.,           May 2, 2013—
        
 The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the gatekeepers of a pair of mutual fund trusts with causing untrue or misleading disclosures about the factors they considered when approving or renewing investment advisory contracts on behalf of shareholders.
Some trusts are created as turnkey mutual fund operations that launch numerous funds to be managed by different unaffiliated advisers and overseen by a single board of trustees.  The federal securities laws require all mutual fund directors to evaluate and approve a fund's contract with its investment adviser, and the funds must report back to shareholders about the material factors considered by the directors in making these decisions.  The SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit has been taking a widespread look into the investment advisory contract renewal process and fee arrangements in the fund industry.
An SEC investigation that arose from an examination of the Northern Lights Fund Trust and the Northern Lights Variable Trust found that some of the trusts' shareholder reports either misrepresented material information considered by the trustees or omitted material information about how they evaluated certain factors in reaching their decisions on behalf of the funds and their shareholders.  The trustees and the trusts' chief compliance officer Northern Lights Compliance Services (NLCS) were responsible for causing violations of the SEC's compliance rule, and the trusts' fund administrator Gemini Fund Services (GFS) caused violations of the Investment Company Act recordkeeping and reporting provisions.
The firms and the trustees have agreed to settle the SEC's charges.
"Determining the terms of the investment advisory contract, especially compensation of the adviser, is one of the most critical duties of a mutual fund board," said George S. Canellos, Co-Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.  "We will aggressively enforce investors' rights to accurate and complete information about the board's process and decision-making."
The five trustees named in the SEC enforcement action are: Michael Miola of Arizona, Lester M. Bryan of Utah, Anthony J. Hertl of Florida, Gary W. Lanzen of Nevada, and Mark H. Taylor of Ohio.
According to the SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings, the Northern Lights trusts included up to 71 mutual fund series from January 2009 to December 2010, most of which were managed by different advisers and sub-advisers.  The trustees conducted 15 board meetings during that time period, and made decisions about 113 advisory and 32 sub-advisory contracts during what's known as the 15(c) process.  Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act requires fund directors to request and evaluate information that is reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of any contract for an investment adviser of a registered investment company.
The SEC's order found that some boilerplate disclosures related to the 15(c) process that were included by GFS in some fund series shareholder reports contained untrue or misleading information.  For example, one disclosure claimed that the trustees had considered peer group information about the advisory fee, however no such data had been provided to the trustees.  Other disclosures misleadingly indicated that the fund's advisory fee was not materially higher than its peer group range, when in fact the fee was nearly double the peer group's mean fee or even higher.  GFS failed to ensure that certain shareholder reports contained the required disclosures about the trustees' evaluation process and failed to ensure that certain series within the trusts maintained and preserved their 15(c) files.
The SEC's order also found that certain mutual fund series did not follow their policies and procedures for the trustees' approval of the investment advisers' compliance programs.  Fund boards are required to approve the policies and procedures of service providers to a fund, including its adviser.  The policies and procedures of each series within the Northern Lights trusts stated that the trustees could approve the compliance program of each series' investment adviser based on their review of an adviser's compliance manual or based on a summary provided by NLCS that familiarized them with the salient features of the compliance program and provided a good understanding of how the program addressed particularly significant compliance risks.  Rather than following this process, the trustees' approval of the advisers' compliance programs was based primarily on their review of a brief written statement prepared by NLCS saying that the advisers' compliance manuals were "sufficient and in use" and a verbal representation by NLCS that such manuals were adequate.
"These violations make clear that turnkey mutual fund arrangements can pose significant governance concerns, and trustees must be vigilant in ensuring that the funds they oversee meet their disclosure, compliance, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations," said Marshall S. Sprung, Deputy Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit.
The SEC's order finds that GFS caused violations of Sections 30(e) and 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 30e-1 and 31a-2(a)(6); NLCS and the trustees caused violations of Rule 38a-1(a)(1) under the Investment Company Act; and the trustees caused violations of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, GFS and NLCS each agreed to pay $50,000 penalties, and the firms and trustees agreed to engage an independent compliance consultant to address the violations found in the SEC's order.  They agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of those provisions.
The SEC's investigation was conducted by Asset Management Unit members in the Denver and New York offices, including James Scoggins, Noel Franklin, John Mulhern, and Catherine Lifeso.  The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Bruce Ketter, Craig Ellis, and Phil Perrone of the Denver office.
