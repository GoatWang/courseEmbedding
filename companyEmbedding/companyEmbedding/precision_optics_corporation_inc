TOOLING
 


Let’s face it, optics molding is different than typical injection molding – alot different.  The same can be said about optics tooling – it’s quite a bit different than traditional commodity injection tooling.  When you’re working with optical prescription irregularity tolerances in millionths of an inch, and your customers expect total perfection shot after shot, then your injection molds have to be precise.


 
NEW MOLDS

At Diverse Optics, we don’t cut corners on injection molds.  Our new mold procurement process ensures that your tooling is designed and built for years of worry-free series production up to a million molded optics – guaranteed. We start by listening to our customer to fully understand the unique requirements of their program.  We gather our team of experts for a comprehensive program review and provide feedback that often times includes suggestions to improve performance and reduce cost.  Our engineers determine the right mold design concept for your optics based on over 20 years of experience building hundreds of optics molds.  We know what works – and more importantly what doesn’t.  After you are fully satisfied and all requirements, questions, and concerns have been addressed, we move on to tooling fabrication.
Strategic alliances with an extensive support base of experienced domestic and offshore mold makers ensure our customer’s objectives for quality, delivery, and value are met.  Our engineers match strategic mold making partners to your requirements, conduct mold design reviews, perform mold flows as necessary, provide detailed delivery information, and ensure all your specifications are achieved.
Our process includes a complete set of 3D and 2D tool designs that are reviewed and “red-lined” until we are satisfied. Upon request, designs are shared with our customer for their approval prior to tool build.  To maintain tight schedules, we focus on early delivery of optical pins and inserts only a few weeks into the tool build.  This enables us to work on optical surfaces concurrently with the rest of the build.  The mold base and optical components are delivered simultaneously for final assembly, inspection, and the beginning of mold trials.



SOCIETY OF PLASTICS INDUSTRY (SPI) TOOLING CLASSIFICATIONS:




											Class 101 Mold – Guaranteed for 1,000,000 cycles or more.
											Built for extremely high production. Made with only the highest quality materials.
										

											Class 102 Mold – Guaranteed for 1,000,000 cycles.
											Medium to high production mold, good for abrasive materials and/or parts requiring close tolerances.
										

											Class 103 Mold – Guaranteed for 500,000 cycles.
											Low to medium production mold.
										

											Class 104 – Guaranteed for 100,000 cycles.
											Low production mold. Used only for limited production, preferably with non-abrasive materials. Moderate price range.
										

											Class 105 – Guaranteed for 25,000 – 50,000 cycles.
Light production / prototype mold. Used only for limited production, preferably with non-abrasive materials. Low price range.										




ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER TRANSFERRED TOOLING

	Diverse Optics welcomes the opportunity for customers to transfer their molds to us from other suppliers – what we call transfer tooling. As Forrest Gump liked to say, transfer molds are indeed “like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get.”
Over the years, we have inherited many molds from other molders that make us cringe. It’s not their fault, they just don’t specialize in injection molding precision optics, where the traditional practices and customs just won’t work. What most commodity injection molders don’t realize is that optics have a prescription, and you can’t just cut the mold inserts to a 3D solid model and expect the resulting optics to deliver optimal performance. Optics molding requires the highest degree of precision.
Our incoming transfer mold process includes a complete evaluation of your mold in its current state – the way we receive it. We’ll document the condition of your mold along with some digital pictures to show you our findings and tell you if your mold has the capability to mold your optics to your print specifications. We’ll make recommendations for improvements to your mold to make it production ready and perform those modifications on site in our mold repair and maintenance department.
Being a precision polymer optics molder takes more than injection molding know-how, it takes a complete understanding of optics and how those optics function in your system. From laser collimation, to imaging, to illumination, we know optics – upside down and backwards. So bring us your problem molds and let Diverse Optics show you how we can make your problems become successes.


 
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

							The cornerstone of our business is preventive maintenance on our customer’s molds. It’s actually quite self serving, because well maintained molds make our job easier. A well maintained mold operates trouble free and will produce millions of polymer optics. Conversely, a neglected mold causes us nothing but trouble by adding inconsistency and introducing variation. Diverse Optics’ primary focus is running your molds at their optimum performance capability and maximizing mold longevity through complete mold maintenance.


ON-SITE REPAIR & MAINTENANCE



CNC and conventional milling machines, surface grinders, EDM, conventional lathe, & machine tools

Real-time adjustments are made in-house during mold trials based on molding technician feedback to ensure rapid start up
				 and adherence to delivery schedules
 									 



								We perform routine preventive maintenance for customer furnished molds as a part of our “Evergreen” service to make sure your molds remain perennially fresh.
The Evergreen service includes routine maintenance under normal circumstances and manufacturing conditions, repair of any accidental damage, and complete major and minor maintenance according to established plastics industry standards at prescribed intervals. We perform our standard evergreen policy on your molds, performing all required maintenance while the mold remains in our possession during the guaranteed cycle period.
							
 
RISK PREVENTION

Risk prevention is a critical element in all our polymer optics programs. That’s why we start with a top-notch preventive mold maintenance program to ensure your molds remain fully functional and production ready. But even with the best preventive maintenance, sometimes the unthinkable happens and an unforeseeable failure occurs. It’s just a part of manufacturing.
Risk tolerance varies greatly by customer, industry and budget. When it comes to polymer optics manufacturing, an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure. At Diverse Optics, we’ll provide a comprehensive risk assessment and present multiple options that meet your level of risk tolerance and available budget. These options might include taking an inventory position to ensure supply, diamond turning optics in place of injection molding, stocking spares of only the most critical optical mold components (pins), or building a complete duplicate (back-up) mold. Whatever your situation, we’ll work with you to make sure you can sleep at night.

Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. Key Developments

OmniVision Technologies, Inc and Precision Optics Corp. Collaborate to Integrate Ultra-Small Image Sensors and Customized Optics for Endoscopes
Jun 13 17
OmniVision Technologies, Inc. together with Precision Optics Corp. announced a collaboration to develop a miniaturized, high-quality optical solution based on OmniVision's OV6948 image sensor technology integrated with three Precision Optics Microprecision lenses. This camera solution enables the design and manufacture of very small diameter endoscopes, which can be used for medical procedures previously performed "blind" or with suboptimal visualization technologies, such as fiber optics. Minimally invasive surgical procedures are a growing trend globally. Frequently, these include complicated procedures with limited access, that call for smaller instruments with improved visualization for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Often these procedures require devices that will work through very small incisions, even down to 1mm or smaller. This is particularly true in the disciplines of ophthalmology, cardiology and neurology, for example. Precision Optics Corporation has developed its Microprecision lens technology to address the challenges associated with the design and fabrication of very small lenses, optics and optical systems. As the size of lenses and other optical elements gets smaller than a couple millimeters, traditional procedures, tooling and fixturing for fabricating glass and polymer lenses become impractical. Similarly, better alternatives to traditional approaches to the design and manufacture of optical systems and the associated mechanics need to be explored. The Microprecision lens technology is based on a new paradigm, developed for the design, fabrication and assembly of very small optical elements and systems, while maintaining high image quality and low cost. This technology has enabled the manufacture of some of the smallest individual optical components and endoscopes in the world – 0.05 mm and 0.6 mm, respectively.

Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. Announces Operating Results For The Second Quarter And Six Months Of Fiscal Year 2017






GlobeNewswire



Feb 14, 2017 4:25 PM EST













 


















































 GARDNER, Mass., Feb. 14, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. (OTCQB:PEYE) (the "Company") today announced operating results on an unaudited basis for its second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2016, of fiscal year 2017. Second quarter highlights include:  Completion of an $800,000 private placement offering; $353,182 decrease in revenues during quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same quarter of the prior year; Gross margin improvements during the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2016 to 24.7% and 21.7%, respectively, compared to 22.7% in the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and 19.3% in the six months ended December 31, 2015; Reductions in SG&A expenses of $64,601 and $85,845 in the quarter and six month periods ended December 31, 2016, respectively, when compared to SG&A expenses in the same periods of the prior year; Increasing market demand for small sized and disposable micro cameras; Development of smaller CMOS camera module using low cost, high performance proprietary technology.  Commenting on the results, Company CEO, Joseph Forkey, said, "In spite of the recent progress Precision Optics has made with margins, cost containment and increasing product and engineering service activities, we experienced a 37% decline in revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the previous year. The decline occurred in both the engineering service and production categories. With the exception of one product that we no longer manufacture, the declines resulted principally from timing delays related to engineering project development and release to production schedules and from the cyclical purchasing patterns of some traditional products by our customers. We continue to see robust activity in existing and prospective customer demand for our unique design, engineering and production capabilities, and believe this quarter's revenue decline will be temporary." Dr. Forkey continued, "We are pleased with the margin improvements even at this lower level of revenue, which represents our improving operational performance in engineering and production services relating to our core technologies. Margins increased to 24.7% and 21.7% during the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, principally as a result of efficient production of three traditional products comprising 43% of production revenue during the six months, and from cost containment efforts, including the elimination of our internal thin film coating operation."

TOOLING
 


Let’s face it, optics molding is different than typical injection molding – alot different.  The same can be said about optics tooling – it’s quite a bit different than traditional commodity injection tooling.  When you’re working with optical prescription irregularity tolerances in millionths of an inch, and your customers expect total perfection shot after shot, then your injection molds have to be precise.


 
NEW MOLDS

At Diverse Optics, we don’t cut corners on injection molds.  Our new mold procurement process ensures that your tooling is designed and built for years of worry-free series production up to a million molded optics – guaranteed. We start by listening to our customer to fully understand the unique requirements of their program.  We gather our team of experts for a comprehensive program review and provide feedback that often times includes suggestions to improve performance and reduce cost.  Our engineers determine the right mold design concept for your optics based on over 20 years of experience building hundreds of optics molds.  We know what works – and more importantly what doesn’t.  After you are fully satisfied and all requirements, questions, and concerns have been addressed, we move on to tooling fabrication.
Strategic alliances with an extensive support base of experienced domestic and offshore mold makers ensure our customer’s objectives for quality, delivery, and value are met.  Our engineers match strategic mold making partners to your requirements, conduct mold design reviews, perform mold flows as necessary, provide detailed delivery information, and ensure all your specifications are achieved.
Our process includes a complete set of 3D and 2D tool designs that are reviewed and “red-lined” until we are satisfied. Upon request, designs are shared with our customer for their approval prior to tool build.  To maintain tight schedules, we focus on early delivery of optical pins and inserts only a few weeks into the tool build.  This enables us to work on optical surfaces concurrently with the rest of the build.  The mold base and optical components are delivered simultaneously for final assembly, inspection, and the beginning of mold trials.



SOCIETY OF PLASTICS INDUSTRY (SPI) TOOLING CLASSIFICATIONS:




											Class 101 Mold – Guaranteed for 1,000,000 cycles or more.
											Built for extremely high production. Made with only the highest quality materials.
										

											Class 102 Mold – Guaranteed for 1,000,000 cycles.
											Medium to high production mold, good for abrasive materials and/or parts requiring close tolerances.
										

											Class 103 Mold – Guaranteed for 500,000 cycles.
											Low to medium production mold.
										

											Class 104 – Guaranteed for 100,000 cycles.
											Low production mold. Used only for limited production, preferably with non-abrasive materials. Moderate price range.
										

											Class 105 – Guaranteed for 25,000 – 50,000 cycles.
Light production / prototype mold. Used only for limited production, preferably with non-abrasive materials. Low price range.										




ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER TRANSFERRED TOOLING

	Diverse Optics welcomes the opportunity for customers to transfer their molds to us from other suppliers – what we call transfer tooling. As Forrest Gump liked to say, transfer molds are indeed “like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get.”
Over the years, we have inherited many molds from other molders that make us cringe. It’s not their fault, they just don’t specialize in injection molding precision optics, where the traditional practices and customs just won’t work. What most commodity injection molders don’t realize is that optics have a prescription, and you can’t just cut the mold inserts to a 3D solid model and expect the resulting optics to deliver optimal performance. Optics molding requires the highest degree of precision.
Our incoming transfer mold process includes a complete evaluation of your mold in its current state – the way we receive it. We’ll document the condition of your mold along with some digital pictures to show you our findings and tell you if your mold has the capability to mold your optics to your print specifications. We’ll make recommendations for improvements to your mold to make it production ready and perform those modifications on site in our mold repair and maintenance department.
Being a precision polymer optics molder takes more than injection molding know-how, it takes a complete understanding of optics and how those optics function in your system. From laser collimation, to imaging, to illumination, we know optics – upside down and backwards. So bring us your problem molds and let Diverse Optics show you how we can make your problems become successes.


 
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

							The cornerstone of our business is preventive maintenance on our customer’s molds. It’s actually quite self serving, because well maintained molds make our job easier. A well maintained mold operates trouble free and will produce millions of polymer optics. Conversely, a neglected mold causes us nothing but trouble by adding inconsistency and introducing variation. Diverse Optics’ primary focus is running your molds at their optimum performance capability and maximizing mold longevity through complete mold maintenance.


ON-SITE REPAIR & MAINTENANCE



CNC and conventional milling machines, surface grinders, EDM, conventional lathe, & machine tools

Real-time adjustments are made in-house during mold trials based on molding technician feedback to ensure rapid start up
				 and adherence to delivery schedules
 									 



								We perform routine preventive maintenance for customer furnished molds as a part of our “Evergreen” service to make sure your molds remain perennially fresh.
The Evergreen service includes routine maintenance under normal circumstances and manufacturing conditions, repair of any accidental damage, and complete major and minor maintenance according to established plastics industry standards at prescribed intervals. We perform our standard evergreen policy on your molds, performing all required maintenance while the mold remains in our possession during the guaranteed cycle period.
							
 
RISK PREVENTION

Risk prevention is a critical element in all our polymer optics programs. That’s why we start with a top-notch preventive mold maintenance program to ensure your molds remain fully functional and production ready. But even with the best preventive maintenance, sometimes the unthinkable happens and an unforeseeable failure occurs. It’s just a part of manufacturing.
Risk tolerance varies greatly by customer, industry and budget. When it comes to polymer optics manufacturing, an ounce of prevention is certainly worth a pound of cure. At Diverse Optics, we’ll provide a comprehensive risk assessment and present multiple options that meet your level of risk tolerance and available budget. These options might include taking an inventory position to ensure supply, diamond turning optics in place of injection molding, stocking spares of only the most critical optical mold components (pins), or building a complete duplicate (back-up) mold. Whatever your situation, we’ll work with you to make sure you can sleep at night.

In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
