Our Brewery

LOCATED ON OUR 5.5 ACRE GREEN FIELD SITE IN ELLON, JUST NORTH OF ABERDEEN, OUR STATE OF THE ART ECO BREWERY IS ONE OF THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BREWERIES IN THE WORLD.
Sitting amid the harsh and rugged landscape of Aberdeenshire, we are proud to start each day in what is the world’s first ever crowd-funded brewery. Every beer we make is a reality conferred by the belief of over 15,000 Equity Punks who invested in our company. Everyday we constantly strive to challenge people's perceptions about beer, and to evolve and push the boundaries of brewing, our equipment, and ourselves.
Only completed in 2013, our HQ brewery was built and kitted out with the proceeds of the last round of our Equity Punk investment. It was a brewery built by our fans and by beer drinkers. Everything and everyone at our brewery is focused on one thing and one thing only; making the best beers we possibly can as we look to put the passion, the choice and the artisan craftsmanship back into people’s beer glasses.
At the end of the day, it all comes down to the quality and taste of what is in your glass.
  

Environmental technology is also something that is very important to us at BrewDog. Our brewhouse features a progressive heat recovery system, which drastically cuts our energy consumption, and all of our brewing by-products, spent malt, hops and yeast are utilised by local farmers.
Our brewery also boasts a tap room called DogTap (you can book a tour in the link below), a high-tech pilot brewhouse where we develop new Beers, and a Jacuzzi which is filled with Punk IPA.*
*One of these is a lie. Unfortunately.
Its been an amazing journey since we started out in 2007 with two humans and a dog – and that journey is set to continue… 


Our brewery taproom serves up the freshest BrewDog beer on the planet!

Once we have decided on the recipe, got the ingredients ready and turned up the volume on our stereo, the brewing process looks something like this:

At BrewDog we are on a mission to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are. All we care about is brewing world class craft beer; extraordinary beers that blow people's minds and kick start a revolution.
Punk IPA is the beer that started that revolution. And our Headliners are the beers that stand shoulder to hop-flecked shoulder alongside it. These are the beers we brew most frequently. They are the beers our die-hard beer geek fans come back to, time and time again. 

No added ingredients or preservatives. No chemicals. No cheap substitutes. Just barley, hops, yeast, water and mind-blowing flavour.
Experimentation is our Art. Revolution our weapon. Walk tall, kick ass and learn to speak craft beer.

2007

2 employees + 1 dog
1,050HL beer brewed

MARTIN AND I (JAMES) WERE BORED OF THE INDUSTRIALLY BREWED LAGERS AND STUFFY ALES THAT DOMINATED THE UK BEER MARKET.
We decided the best way to fix this undesirable predicament was to brew our own. Consequently in April 2007 BrewDog was born.
Both only 24 at the time, we leased a building in Fraserburgh, got some scary bank loans, spent all our money on stainless steel and started making some hardcore craft beers.
We brewed tiny batches, filled bottles by hand and sold our beers at local markets and out of the back of our beat up old van.
Our biggest mission when we set up BrewDog was to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are. And that is still our biggest mission today. 











2008

9 employees + 1 dog
4,050HL beer brewed
2 shareholders

THINGS STARTED GETTING CRAZY FOR US IN 2008. THEY HAVE STAYED CRAZY, OR PERHAPS GOT EVEN CRAZIER, EVER SINCE.
We somehow persuaded the banks to give us money to buy loads more tanks and a proper bottling machine.
We masterminded the UK's strongest ever beer, Tokyo. This resulted in a huge media storm, and if you believed the headlines, the downfall of Western civilisation.
The Portman Group pretty much banned all of our beers. But we started exporting to Sweden, Japan and America. We also got to go on TV with Oz Clark.
And in only the 2nd year of BrewDog we became Scotland’s largest independent brewery. 











2009

24 employees + 1 dog
9,500HL beer brewed
1,329 shareholders
0 

													Bars												



By this point, BrewDog had become the UK’s fastest-growing alternative beer brand, and the Punk IPA became the top-selling IPA in Scandinavia.
To keep up with the sheer demand for our beers we needed more huge tanks, but had no room inside our Fraserburgh brewery to put them. So when they arrived, outside they went.
We also launched Equity for Punks. In a ground-breaking first, we offered people the opportunity to buy shares in our company online. Over 1,300 invested and our anti-business business model was born.
We continued to push boundaries and smash people's perceptions of what beer can be by brewing the world's strongest ever beer, Tactical Nuclear Penguin at 32%.
We also aged a beer on the deck of a fishing boat, smashed loads of industrial beers with a golf club and grew our business by 200% (in the worst recession for generations). 











2010

39 employees + 1 dog
15,800HL beer brewed
1,329 shareholders
1 

													Bar												



2010 WAS A VERITABLE ROLLER COASTER FOR US AS WE CONTINUED OUR MISSION TO SPREAD THE CRAFT BEER GOSPEL.
Opening our first craft beer bar in our home town of Aberdeen was a dream come true, and we were blown away by the response from customers.
We picked up the Gold Medal for Hardcore IPA at the World Beer Cup and James became Scotland's youngest ever Entrepreneur of the Year.
We brewed a 55% abv beer and packed it in roadkill, making it the world's most expensive beer ever as we fused the seldom-colliding worlds of art, craft beer and taxidermy.
We managed to find space for even more fermentation tanks in our increasingly cramped brewery and we also held our first ever AGM for our Equity Punk shareholders in a very snowy Aberdeen in December. 











2011

67 employees + 1 dog
26,750HL beer brewed
6,567 shareholders
4 

													Bars												



Due to the run-away success of BrewDog Aberdeen we were able to open bars in Edinburgh, Glasgow and a flagship London venue in Camden.
In true BrewDog style we announced our arrival in the capital by driving down Camden High Street in a BrewDog tank.
We also brewed a beer at the bottom of the ocean (seriously), dispensed a 28% beer from a modified deer's head and grew our business over 200% (again!) as we started building our new eco-brewery with demand for our beers reaching scary new levels.
Most significantly we also launched Equity for Punks II, raising over £2.2m to help us continue to grow and welcoming over 5,000 new shareholders.
Martin also dressed up as the Queen for our year end video blog. 











2012

135 employees + 1 dog
36,500HL beer brewed
6,567 shareholders
10 

													Bars												



2012 was one hell of a year for BrewDog. We moved from our cobbled-together brewery in Fraserburgh to a state of the art eco-brewery in Ellon.
What started out as a dream five years earlier had become our new reality. The world-class HQ enabled us to tighten every aspect of production, whilst making even more amazing craft beer than ever before.
We were able to grow revenues by 95%, and were awarded the Fastest Growing Company in Scotland and also listed in The Sunday Times Fast Track 100 as the fastest growing food and drink company in the UK.
Six new BrewDog bars opened across the UK, with a new London flagship in Shoreditch as Diageo infamously cheated us from an award for our bars which resulted in another global media storm.
We also projected ourselves naked onto the houses of parliament, made a special beer for the Olympics, launched the phenomenal Dead Pony Club and hosted 2,000 Equity Punks in Aberdeen for our rock ‘n roll AGM. 











2013

224 employees + 1 dog
53,500HL beer brewed
14,208 shareholders
13 

													Bars												



2013 was pretty epic. We raised £4.25m through Equity for Punks III, smashing crowd-funding records along the way, welcoming almost 10,000 new investors from 22 different countries.
We recorded the first season of our own BrewDogs TV show in the US, brewing amazing beers with some of America’s best craft brewers.
We opened our first ever international bar in Stockholm, holding a funeral for generic beer in the centre of the Swedish capital. We were also flattered and bemused in equal measure when a fake BrewDog bar opened in China.
In beer terms, we launched the insanely popular Jack Hammer, doubled the size of our brand new brewery and held mandatory company yoga sessions for all our team in the carpark. (One of these is a lie). 











2014

358 employees + 1 dog
90,000HL beer brewed
14,568 shareholders
25 

													Bars												



2014 was a whirlwind as we continued our mission to make other people as passionate about great beer as we are by adding more beers, more bars, more customers and more team members to our business.
Our assault on humanity continued with the opening of 12 new BrewDog bars as far afield as Brazil and Japan, as well as our first BottleDog and the awesome DogTap at BrewDog HQ.
We also updated our branding and hit the headlines for sticking it to The Portman Group as well as Russian premier, Vladimir Putin.
We released 36 different BrewDog beers, unleashed Truck Norris on the world, hit the screens with a second season of BrewDogs and shipped our beers to 55 different countries. We did not sleep much. 











2015

540 employees + 1 dog
134,000HL beer brewed
32,000 shareholders
39 

													Bars												



IN 2015 WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST EQUITY CROWDFUNDING SCHEME IN HUMAN HISTORY – EQUITY FOR PUNKS IV – BREAKING WORLD RECORDS IN THE PROCESS.
We opened 17 new bars, including an epic new location in our home city of Aberdeen as well as the triple threat of awesome beer, food and BottleDog in the form of DogHouse in Glasgow. We also launched our first ShuffleDog (Leeds), Dog Eat Dog (Angel) and reclaimed central London for craft beer (BrewDog Soho).
We also installed a kick-ass canning line at our Ellon eco-brewery, swept the nation with the long-awaited canned Jack Hammer, and released the strongest canned ale in the world; Black Eyed King Imp.
Our most amazing year yet saw us brew 65 different beers, hit the screens for a third season of Brew Dogs and debut plans for the largest venture in BrewDog history – taking on the USA with BrewDog Columbus. 











2016

750 employees + 1 dog
214,000HL beer brewed
55,000 shareholders
46 

													Bars												



IN 2016 WE SET TWO WORLD RECORDS; ONE FOR THE HIGHEST EVER EQUITY CROWDFUNDING RAISE AND ANOTHER FOR THE MOST CONSECUTIVE YEARS IN THE SUNDAY TIMES FAST TRACK 100.
But we were only just getting started. Over the course of the year our incredible brewing team dialled in 82 different beers – including launching into the world Elvis Juice, Albino Squid Assassin, Jet Black Heart and (for a few weeks at least) Born to Die.
We also opened a brand new 300HL eco-friendly brewhouse in Ellon, began construction of BrewDog Columbus and announced a stand-alone sour facility in Aberdeenshire. Plus we opened nine new bars from Berlin to York, welcomed 6,000 Equity Punks to our AGM and turned the world of spirits upside down with the announcement of LoneWolf.
Oh, and we gave away the detailed recipes to each and every BrewDog beer we ever made.

Punk IPA 





Dead Pony Club 





Jet Black Heart 





5AM Saint 





Kingpin 







At BrewDog we are on a mission to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are. All we care about is brewing world class craft beer; extraordinary beers that blow people's minds and kick start a revolution.
Punk IPA is the beer that started that revolution. And our Headliners are the beers that stand shoulder to hop-flecked shoulder alongside it. These are the beers we brew most frequently. They are the beers our die-hard beer geek fans come back to, time and time again. 

No added ingredients or preservatives. No chemicals. No cheap substitutes. Just barley, hops, yeast, water and mind-blowing flavour.
Experimentation is our Art. Revolution our weapon. Walk tall, kick ass and learn to speak craft beer.

BrewDog USA Headquarters
















“The people of Ohio have absolutely bowled us over with their enthusiasm, passion for beer and warm welcome! Their reaction has been incredible, it’s awesome to know we’ve made the right choice with where to lay the foundations for our American home, and we’ll be throwing one helluva party to thank the locals for their support! ”
James Watt - BrewDog Captain














We are just beginning our story in the USA. From sea to shining sea, we are so excited to be part of the American craft beer scene.
Canal Winchester, Ohio will be home to our brand new brewery, twinned with our Ellon HQ. We have 42 acres of land near Columbus and have constructed a full-scale 100,000 square foot brewery. The site will feature US offices, a visitor centre, a craft beer inspired restaurant and an amazing taproom (DogTap Columbus); Oh and there will be a bike path too. USA HQ will be our epicentre for all things BrewDog in America.
Our mission is to make people as passionate about great craft beer as we are; and our custom-made 100 barrel brew-house and state of the art canning machine will help us manifest those plans. We are refining our American line up and will feature incredible beers such as Punk IPA, Dead Pony Club and Jack Hammer. We will also be brewing some experimental one-of a kind small batch brews to release exclusively to the American Public. 


Our passionate, beer knowledgeable, hop-crazed crew members will be given the opportunity to travel to across the Atlantic in a series of international information interchanges. In so doing, we will be able to share our beery endeavours amongst our supporters in Ohio and beyond, and give an insight into the crazy world of BrewDog.
We have already made a few appearances in Columbus, and have been received with open arms (and plenty of beers) - we couldn't have asked for a warmer welcome. We're so excited to start this new chapter.
DOG. BLESS. AMERICA. 


                            TAKE ME TO THE UK

We adore beer. It’s that simple. But our obsession isn't handcuffed to tradition or constrained by convention. Our art is experimentation.
As well as brewing our Headliner classics like Punk IPA and 5AM Saint we love experimenting with new techniques and ideas; reinventing the art and science behind brewing in the process.
If we want to condition a beer at the bottom of the ocean; we will. If we want to ferment a beer at -20°c for three weeks; we will. If we want to brew the world's strongest beer; screw it, we will. We are determined to challenge people's perceptions of what beer is and how it can be enjoyed. 

Our Small batch selections take the boundaries of beer to a whole new level – leaving their namesakes confused and agog at the potential they could have reached if they’d just challenged their inner weirdo.
Watch the blog, our bars and our online shop for the chance to purchase our small-batch beers.

EVER WANTED TO OWN A PART OF A BREWERY? WELL, KEEP READING







 BREWDOG HAS BEEN THE UK’S FASTEST GROWING FOOD AND DRINKS COMPANY FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS, AND THE 10TH FASTEST GROWING COMPANY IN THE UK OVERALL.

– SundayTimes 2012, 2013 & 2015, The Grocer 2014



BrewDog plc is the largest and fastest growing craft brewer in Europe, and has been the fastest growing food & drinks company in the UK for the last four years consecutively. We plan to take all we have learned from BrewDog plc’s European business as we look to build our US business.
Today, BrewDog plc employs over 600 passionate people, ships beer to more than 55 countries around the world and operates an ever-growing legion of amazing craft beer bars. Despite only starting in 2007, we have built a global reputation for our beers and our brand.
As we establish BrewDog USA, we will take advantage of all of BrewDog’s expertise, infrastructure, intellectual property and management team as we look to turbo-charge our American business.









 BEER SALES 


 With BrewDog USA we plan to combine the experience and success of our explosive European craft brewery with the world’s largest craft beer market.
BrewDog beers have been available in the US in limited quantities since 2008, but our Scottish brewery has simply not been able to keep up with the demand for our beers in America.
However, this means that we already have agreements in place with key distributors in the US, ensuring our route to market is locked down and that we will hit the ground running. We have distributors ready and waiting for our beers.

 REPUTATION 


BrewDog already has a strong media reputation worldwide. BrewDog is one of the top four most followed craft breweries globally on social media, and in 2015 received an average of more than 32,000 American visitors to its website on a monthly basis.
BrewDog has been featured on the Huffington Post, CNN, CNBC, Time magazine and Forbes.



 BREW DOGS THE TV SHOW 


Now airing it’s third season, our TV show Brew Dogs is the longest-running beer TV show in history and is broadcast on Esquire Network in the US.
The TV show celebrates craft beer and has elevated James and Martin to two of the most- recognizable beer industry personalities in the US and beyond. Brew Dogs has helped to build BrewDog’s reputation in the US and further enhance the demand for our beers.


 THE US CRAFT BEER MARKET 


The US is both the largest and fastest-growing craft beer market in the world. Craft breweries account for 12.8% of the beer market in the United States. It is forecasted that by 2020, craft beer will grow to be 20% of the total American beer market.
There have been several recent acquisitions of craft breweries by larger companies in the US including Ballast Point Brewing Company, based in San Diego, which had a production of 123,000 barrels in 2014 and was acquired by Constellation Group for $1 billion in November 2015.










 WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO COMPLETING OUR STATE OF THE ART BREWERY IN COLUMBUS, OHIO. 








We own an amazing 42 acre site just 10 miles from downtown Columbus, and the initial 100,000 sq ft brewery will also feature a restaurant, tap room, retail space, visitor center and beer garden.
The building is due to be completed in summer 2016 and the first brew is scheduled for November.
Everything about the brewery is set up for rapid growth. The initial 170 barrel brewhouse can support an annual capacity of 640,000 barrels and we will initially have fermentation capacity for 85,000 barrels. The site is primed for the future in terms of space, transport links, utilities, infrastructure and brewing equipment.
Long term, the site we have in Columbus can support an annual capacity in excess of 1.5m barrels.










 WHY WE SELECTED COLUMBUS 

 We found a great site with amazing utilities, logistics & expansion potential
 We see a huge opportunity for our beers in the Mid-West
 There is no other mid-sized craft brewery in the Columbus area
 Columbus is within 500 miles of over half of the US population
 We have had an amazing reception from the local community
 We received a $6M incentive package from the city and state
 We love (LOVE) the city of Columbus!














FOR OUR BEERS, WE ALREADY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED ROUTE TO MARKET IN THE STATES. EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR OUR AGGRESSIVE AND STAGED ROLLOUT FROM OUR COLUMBUS BASE.



We are close to finalizing distribution deals in more than 20 states with craft beer distributors in the US ready and waiting for our beers. We already have a strong reputation in the US with customers who are familiar with our beers and our story, so we will be servicing a demand that already exists.
We believe we are starting from a very strong position in terms of distribution, brand recognition and sales personnel, and this strong position will enable us to hit the ground running. In the US, we have the potential to go much bigger, much harder and much faster than in Europe, because we are not starting from scratch.








 INITIAL BREWDOG USA RANGE 




Punk IPA is BrewDog’s flagship beer and the cornerstone of our Headliner Range. Punk IPA accounts for 60% of our sales. Layered with new world hops to create an explosion of tropical fruit and an all-out riot of grapefruit, pineapple and lychee before a spiky bitter finish, this beer is a true transatlantic fusion. Punk IPA is the #1 selling craft beer in the UK and is also the #1 selling craft beer in Scandinavia.








AT BREWDOG, WE ARE ON A MISSION TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE AS PASSIONATE ABOUT WORLD-CLASS CRAFT BEER AS WE ARE. ALL THE BEERS BREWDOG USA WILL BREW HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND LAUNCHED IN EUROPE AND MANY ARE NOW ESTABLISHED GLOBAL BRANDS.







 IN ADDITION TO OUR HEADLINER BEERS, WE WILL ALSO BREW VARIOUS SEASONAL AND SMALL BATCH BEERS AT OUR NEW COLUMBUS BREWERY.











Since opening our first bar, BrewDog Aberdeen in 2010, we now have over 44 BrewDog bars globally including flagship sites in London, Berlin, Barcelona, Tokyo, São Paulo and Stockholm.


  AS IN EUROPE, BREWDOG BARS WILL BE A KEY PART OF BREWDOG’S US OPERATIONS. OUR FIRST BREWDOG BAR IN AMERICA IS DUE TO OPEN IN LATE 2016 AND WILL BE ONSITE AT OUR COLUMBUS BREWERY. OUR SECOND AMERICAN BAR WILL BE IN DOWNTOWN COLUMBUS AND WE HAVE JUST AGREED A DEAL ON THE SITE. 



 BrewDog Bars are places where you can indulge in everything that is great about craft beer. We pride ourselves on having the most knowledgeable staff and showcasing the most flavorsome beers from all over the planet.
As in Europe, our bars enable us to sell more beer, increase our visibility, build our community, and grow our brand. Our retail model has now been honed across 44 sites.
Originally inspired by American bars, each BrewDog bar infuses European beer café culture, contemporary Scottish food, craft cocktails and artisanal spirits into the mix. Our spaces are raw, utilitarian and industrial, using reclaimed materials and vintage features.
We intend to sell around 10% of the beer we brew from our Columbus brewery in our own BrewDog bars and this element of vertical integration will help accelerate our growth, bolster our profitability and foster deeper connections between us and our customers.

We intend to take advantage of the brand recognition BrewDog already has stateside from ourTV show and our online footprint, and translate these into sales. We intend to build on the amazing distribution contracts we already have in place. We intend to take all of our team’s experience of rapidly expanding a craft brewery and apply it in America.

AND WE WANT YOU ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
 YOUR INVESTMENT WILL ENABLE US TO GROW EVEN FASTER.






AT BREWDOG, WE BELIEVE THAT BY HAVING THE CONVICTION TO DO THINGS ON OUR OWN TERMS AND BY LIVING THE PUNK DIY ETHOS, WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD WITH CRAFT BEER. ONE GLASS AT A TIME.

We believe the best way to launch BrewDog USA and to grow our business is to ask you to be involved in our future.
Our growth so far has been phenomenal. And with that growth all set to continue, this is your opportunity to get involved. We want you to share in our future success and own your very own part of BrewDog USA.
This is going to be an awesome journey. And we want you to join us on it. With your investment there is no telling how far we can go.

OUR STRATEGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO TRY TO SHORTEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY OUR BEERS; EQUITY FOR PUNKS IS THE ULTIMATE INCARNATION OF THIS PHILOSOPHY.







We’d rather use this space to tell you more about our awesome beers and how passionate we are about opening bringing BrewDog and our craft beer revolution to the US, but our lawyers asked us to do this instead. So, make them happy by reading this while we get back to doing what we do best: making great craft beer.

Shares cost $47.50 each, and you can buy any number of shares, with the minimum investment being two shares for $95.    What discounts do shareholders get?

TIERED BENEFITS If you invest certain amount you can also get access to some truly exclusive benefits, divided into investment tiers. These benefits stack as well! Find out more in the brochure below!   I live outside the USA! Can I invest?    Yes you can still invest! Our share offering has been qualified by the SEC for US citizens to invest, but investors outside the USA may also be eligible to buy shares too! We’re more than happy for anyone and everyone to invest from anywhere in the world, we just ask that you ensure your own situation allows you to become an investor wherever you live or invest from.  I am already a shareholder, can I buy more?    If you have already bought shares in Equity for Punks for our UK business previously, you are one of the 46,000 people who we class as our nearest and dearest friends. Thank you! As long as you are comfortable that your own situation makes you eligible to be an investor, we’d love for you to join the ranks of our investors in our US company!

You are also eligible for a truly exclusive enamel pin badge as well as a one-off double discount code to use on the BrewDog online shop (yes you’re right, that is up to 40%!)     Can I sell my shares?    While selling your shares is allowed after we close the offering, you will have to find a purchaser as we will not be listed on any exchange. Eventually, our goal is to have the shares publicly listed and tradable on an exchange, but that may not happen for some time.  There is no assurance the shares will ever be publicly listed or that a secondary market will develop.   Can I buy the shares as a gift for someone?      It is awesome to hear that you want to buy someone shares in Equity for Punks USA as a gift!   We are working on a solution for gifting shares at the moment and hoping to have this sorted as soon as possible. As it looks today we can’t accept gift applications just now as the name in which the shares are held must be the same name on the bank account that pays for it.  As soon as we have a solution, we’ll make sure we shout loud about the opportunity when it becomes available!    How is the value of the company calculated?    The valuation of the company was based on many factors, including expected volumes to be produced, capacity and potential for expansion, anticipated demand and recent acquisitions of other breweries.    The valuation was not based on any set valuation criteria, and was not based on an independent, third party valuation.      How is Equity for Punks regulated?     We are thrilled to be able to offer our Equity for Punks USA shares through ‘Regulation A+’ in the States which was just made legal last year, allowing our American friends to join our legions of passionate shareholders across the world by investing in BrewDog USA! As one of the first companies to launch an equity crowdfunding round in the US we hope to inspire more companies to raise funds through this awesome alternative way of funding your business!  BrewDog's Equity for Punks USA offer is being made under “Regulation A+” which is Title IV of the JOBS Act. Our offering had to be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by them before we could offer any shares for sale. Equity for Punks USA is regulated by federal and state securities laws. The legal work in preparing the offering circular and the offering itself was carried out by attorney Kendall Almerico and his law firm DiMuroGinsberg. The audit of BrewDog USA Inc.'s financial records was carried out by Ernst & Young, and these records are the basis for the financial information contained in the offering circular.       When am I allowed to invest?    You can invest right now! Just check out the information and Offering Circular, including investment risks, on this page.      Why crowdfunding, and what’s with this Regulation A+ word salad?    BrewDog is an alternative small business from Scotland, owned by thousands of people who love craft beer. They are our shareholders, our friends, our community and the heart and soul of our business.     In 2010, we tore up convention, turned the traditional business model on its head and launched Equity for Punks giving thousands of people in Europe a front row seat to the craft beer revolution.     But we could not do the same thing in America until Regulation A+ recently became legal, allowing our American friends to join our legions of passionate shareholders across the world by investing in BrewDog USA.      This is your chance to join our 46,000 global Equity Punk community who are the heart and soul of our operations.     How much are you going to raise?    We are releasing enough shares to raise up to $50 million, and every penny invested will help build our brewery and our business in Columbus, Ohio and BrewDog bars across America. The number of bars we can launch will depend on the final amount raised, but there is no minimum we need to raise.     Why raise all this money if the brewery is already being built?     The more money we raise, the faster we are able to grow and to get BrewDog beer into the hands of more and more craft beer fans across the US. The more money we raise, the more BrewDog bars we can open in more cities. In our offering circular, we explain in more detail what we intend to do with the money raised.     Can anyone invest?    Yes, anyone can invest! Regulation A+ allows anyone to invest in our company, not just the fat cats and rich people with yachts and swimming pools who used to hold a monopoly over investment in companies like ours. With Regulation A+, BrewDog can accept investments from anyone, and you can become part of our craft beer revolution for as little at $95. We would much rather have the backing of craft beer fans who love and care about the beer we make, than just the rich folks on Wall Street.     How long will people be able to buy the stock?    Shares will be available until July 31, 2017 (subject to change), or until we raise a total of $50 million; whichever is sooner.      How do people pay for the stock?    When you click the Invest Now button on this page you will fill out a couple of forms and then have the opportunity to pay either by ACH (you electronically transfer the money from your bank account to a bank escrow account, who then releases it to us), BACS (a similar system to ACH available to UK investors), wire, or by check. Unfortunately, under US law, you cannot use a credit or debit card, but we still made the process as easy for you to follow as we are allowed to by law!     Will the stock be listed on an exchange like NASDAQ?    Eventually, that is our goal.  But for now, our shares are not publicly traded on any exchange.     How many shares of stock are available? What happens when they run out?    We started with a total of 1,052,632 shares to sell. The number available goes down every time a new Equity Punk joins our American craft beer revolution. When these shares run out, there are no more for sale in this offering.     Where do you plan on opening BrewDog bars?    We’re planning on launching a number of epic craft beer brew pubs and bars across the States. Initially, we have our sights set on Columbus, Ohio – we’ve secured an epic location in Franklinton – but we’ll also be looking at where we see hubs of investment from new Equity Punks, and bump any interesting regions up our list!   What happens if you raise less than $50 million?    We are building a world-class craft beer brewery in Columbus and coming to America, no matter how much money we raise. But, the more we raise, the faster we can grow, and the quicker we can recruit an amazing crew of craft beer crusaders as foot soldiers for BrewDog USA. Every dollar invested will be used to expand our US operations in order to spread our passion for great craft beer across this great country.    I heard about the private equity investment into BrewDog plc. How does that affect BrewDog USA Inc. and this offering? BrewDog plc is very excited about the minority investment into their UK company. However, to be clear, that investment was made into BrewDog plc, the UK parent company of BrewDog USA Inc., and not directly into BrewDog USA Inc., the company that is offering shares in this Regulation A offering. The private equity investment into BrewDog plc will have no effect on the price of the shares we are selling in this offering and it will not affect the terms of this offering in any way. However, our parent company is thrilled about the $264 million investment which gives BrewDog plc a $1.24 billion valuation. BrewDog plc intends to use those funds to continue its global growth and also to provide its shareholders with some liquidity for their investments into our parent company. For more on the announcement about the minority investment into our parent company, BrewDog plc, click here.    I have another question – who can I talk to?

 BREWDOG HAS BEEN THE UK’S FASTEST GROWING FOOD AND DRINKS COMPANY FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS, AND THE 10TH FASTEST GROWING COMPANY IN THE UK OVERALL.

– SundayTimes 2012, 2013 & 2015, The Grocer 2014



BrewDog plc is the largest and fastest growing craft brewer in Europe, and has been the fastest growing food & drinks company in the UK for the last four years consecutively. We plan to take all we have learned from BrewDog plc’s European business as we look to build our US business.
Today, BrewDog plc employs over 600 passionate people, ships beer to more than 55 countries around the world and operates an ever-growing legion of amazing craft beer bars. Despite only starting in 2007, we have built a global reputation for our beers and our brand.
As we establish BrewDog USA, we will take advantage of all of BrewDog’s expertise, infrastructure, intellectual property and management team as we look to turbo-charge our American business.









 BEER SALES 


 With BrewDog USA we plan to combine the experience and success of our explosive European craft brewery with the world’s largest craft beer market.
BrewDog beers have been available in the US in limited quantities since 2008, but our Scottish brewery has simply not been able to keep up with the demand for our beers in America.
However, this means that we already have agreements in place with key distributors in the US, ensuring our route to market is locked down and that we will hit the ground running. We have distributors ready and waiting for our beers.

 REPUTATION 


BrewDog already has a strong media reputation worldwide. BrewDog is one of the top four most followed craft breweries globally on social media, and in 2015 received an average of more than 32,000 American visitors to its website on a monthly basis.
BrewDog has been featured on the Huffington Post, CNN, CNBC, Time magazine and Forbes.



 BREW DOGS THE TV SHOW 


Now airing it’s third season, our TV show Brew Dogs is the longest-running beer TV show in history and is broadcast on Esquire Network in the US.
The TV show celebrates craft beer and has elevated James and Martin to two of the most- recognizable beer industry personalities in the US and beyond. Brew Dogs has helped to build BrewDog’s reputation in the US and further enhance the demand for our beers.


 THE US CRAFT BEER MARKET 


The US is both the largest and fastest-growing craft beer market in the world. Craft breweries account for 12.8% of the beer market in the United States. It is forecasted that by 2020, craft beer will grow to be 20% of the total American beer market.
There have been several recent acquisitions of craft breweries by larger companies in the US including Ballast Point Brewing Company, based in San Diego, which had a production of 123,000 barrels in 2014 and was acquired by Constellation Group for $1 billion in November 2015.










 WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO COMPLETING OUR STATE OF THE ART BREWERY IN COLUMBUS, OHIO. 








We own an amazing 42 acre site just 10 miles from downtown Columbus, and the initial 100,000 sq ft brewery will also feature a restaurant, tap room, retail space, visitor center and beer garden.
The building is due to be completed in summer 2016 and the first brew is scheduled for November.
Everything about the brewery is set up for rapid growth. The initial 170 barrel brewhouse can support an annual capacity of 640,000 barrels and we will initially have fermentation capacity for 85,000 barrels. The site is primed for the future in terms of space, transport links, utilities, infrastructure and brewing equipment.
Long term, the site we have in Columbus can support an annual capacity in excess of 1.5m barrels.










 WHY WE SELECTED COLUMBUS 

 We found a great site with amazing utilities, logistics & expansion potential
 We see a huge opportunity for our beers in the Mid-West
 There is no other mid-sized craft brewery in the Columbus area
 Columbus is within 500 miles of over half of the US population
 We have had an amazing reception from the local community
 We received a $6M incentive package from the city and state
 We love (LOVE) the city of Columbus!














FOR OUR BEERS, WE ALREADY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED ROUTE TO MARKET IN THE STATES. EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR OUR AGGRESSIVE AND STAGED ROLLOUT FROM OUR COLUMBUS BASE.



We are close to finalizing distribution deals in more than 20 states with craft beer distributors in the US ready and waiting for our beers. We already have a strong reputation in the US with customers who are familiar with our beers and our story, so we will be servicing a demand that already exists.
We believe we are starting from a very strong position in terms of distribution, brand recognition and sales personnel, and this strong position will enable us to hit the ground running. In the US, we have the potential to go much bigger, much harder and much faster than in Europe, because we are not starting from scratch.








 INITIAL BREWDOG USA RANGE 




Punk IPA is BrewDog’s flagship beer and the cornerstone of our Headliner Range. Punk IPA accounts for 60% of our sales. Layered with new world hops to create an explosion of tropical fruit and an all-out riot of grapefruit, pineapple and lychee before a spiky bitter finish, this beer is a true transatlantic fusion. Punk IPA is the #1 selling craft beer in the UK and is also the #1 selling craft beer in Scandinavia.








AT BREWDOG, WE ARE ON A MISSION TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE AS PASSIONATE ABOUT WORLD-CLASS CRAFT BEER AS WE ARE. ALL THE BEERS BREWDOG USA WILL BREW HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND LAUNCHED IN EUROPE AND MANY ARE NOW ESTABLISHED GLOBAL BRANDS.







 IN ADDITION TO OUR HEADLINER BEERS, WE WILL ALSO BREW VARIOUS SEASONAL AND SMALL BATCH BEERS AT OUR NEW COLUMBUS BREWERY.











Since opening our first bar, BrewDog Aberdeen in 2010, we now have over 44 BrewDog bars globally including flagship sites in London, Berlin, Barcelona, Tokyo, São Paulo and Stockholm.


  AS IN EUROPE, BREWDOG BARS WILL BE A KEY PART OF BREWDOG’S US OPERATIONS. OUR FIRST BREWDOG BAR IN AMERICA IS DUE TO OPEN IN LATE 2016 AND WILL BE ONSITE AT OUR COLUMBUS BREWERY. OUR SECOND AMERICAN BAR WILL BE IN DOWNTOWN COLUMBUS AND WE HAVE JUST AGREED A DEAL ON THE SITE. 



 BrewDog Bars are places where you can indulge in everything that is great about craft beer. We pride ourselves on having the most knowledgeable staff and showcasing the most flavorsome beers from all over the planet.
As in Europe, our bars enable us to sell more beer, increase our visibility, build our community, and grow our brand. Our retail model has now been honed across 44 sites.
Originally inspired by American bars, each BrewDog bar infuses European beer café culture, contemporary Scottish food, craft cocktails and artisanal spirits into the mix. Our spaces are raw, utilitarian and industrial, using reclaimed materials and vintage features.
We intend to sell around 10% of the beer we brew from our Columbus brewery in our own BrewDog bars and this element of vertical integration will help accelerate our growth, bolster our profitability and foster deeper connections between us and our customers.

LET’S GO AMERICA!

We intend to replicate BrewDog plc’s European successes in the far larger craft beer market of the USA. We intend to take advantage of the brand recognition BrewDog already has stateside from ourTV show and our online footprint, and translate these into sales. We intend to build on the amazing distribution contracts we already have in place. We intend to take all of our team’s experience of rapidly expanding a craft brewery and apply it in America.

AND WE WANT YOU ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
 YOUR INVESTMENT WILL ENABLE US TO GROW EVEN FASTER.






AT BREWDOG, WE BELIEVE THAT BY HAVING THE CONVICTION TO DO THINGS ON OUR OWN TERMS AND BY LIVING THE PUNK DIY ETHOS, WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD WITH CRAFT BEER. ONE GLASS AT A TIME.

We believe the best way to launch BrewDog USA and to grow our business is to ask you to be involved in our future.
Our growth so far has been phenomenal. And with that growth all set to continue, this is your opportunity to get involved. We want you to share in our future success and own your very own part of BrewDog USA.
This is going to be an awesome journey. And we want you to join us on it. With your investment there is no telling how far we can go.

OUR STRATEGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO TRY TO SHORTEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY OUR BEERS; EQUITY FOR PUNKS IS THE ULTIMATE INCARNATION OF THIS PHILOSOPHY.







We’d rather use this space to tell you more about our awesome beers and how passionate we are about opening bringing BrewDog and our craft beer revolution to the US, but our lawyers asked us to do this instead. So, make them happy by reading this while we get back to doing what we do best: making great craft beer.

You are also eligible for a truly exclusive enamel pin badge as well as a one-off double discount code to use on the BrewDog online shop (yes you’re right, that is up to 40%!)     Can I sell my shares?    While selling your shares is allowed after we close the offering, you will have to find a purchaser as we will not be listed on any exchange. Eventually, our goal is to have the shares publicly listed and tradable on an exchange, but that may not happen for some time.  There is no assurance the shares will ever be publicly listed or that a secondary market will develop.   Can I buy the shares as a gift for someone?      It is awesome to hear that you want to buy someone shares in Equity for Punks USA as a gift!   We are working on a solution for gifting shares at the moment and hoping to have this sorted as soon as possible. As it looks today we can’t accept gift applications just now as the name in which the shares are held must be the same name on the bank account that pays for it.  As soon as we have a solution, we’ll make sure we shout loud about the opportunity when it becomes available!    How is the value of the company calculated?    The valuation of the company was based on many factors, including expected volumes to be produced, capacity and potential for expansion, anticipated demand and recent acquisitions of other breweries.    The valuation was not based on any set valuation criteria, and was not based on an independent, third party valuation.      How is Equity for Punks regulated?     We are thrilled to be able to offer our Equity for Punks USA shares through ‘Regulation A+’ in the States which was just made legal last year, allowing our American friends to join our legions of passionate shareholders across the world by investing in BrewDog USA! As one of the first companies to launch an equity crowdfunding round in the US we hope to inspire more companies to raise funds through this awesome alternative way of funding your business!  BrewDog's Equity for Punks USA offer is being made under “Regulation A+” which is Title IV of the JOBS Act. Our offering had to be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by them before we could offer any shares for sale. Equity for Punks USA is regulated by federal and state securities laws. The legal work in preparing the offering circular and the offering itself was carried out by attorney Kendall Almerico and his law firm DiMuroGinsberg. The audit of BrewDog USA Inc.'s financial records was carried out by Ernst & Young, and these records are the basis for the financial information contained in the offering circular.       When am I allowed to invest?    You can invest right now! Just check out the information and Offering Circular, including investment risks, on this page.      Why crowdfunding, and what’s with this Regulation A+ word salad?    BrewDog is an alternative small business from Scotland, owned by thousands of people who love craft beer. They are our shareholders, our friends, our community and the heart and soul of our business.     In 2010, we tore up convention, turned the traditional business model on its head and launched Equity for Punks giving thousands of people in Europe a front row seat to the craft beer revolution.     But we could not do the same thing in America until Regulation A+ recently became legal, allowing our American friends to join our legions of passionate shareholders across the world by investing in BrewDog USA.      This is your chance to join our 46,000 global Equity Punk community who are the heart and soul of our operations.     How much are you going to raise?    We are releasing enough shares to raise up to $50 million, and every penny invested will help build our brewery and our business in Columbus, Ohio and BrewDog bars across America. The number of bars we can launch will depend on the final amount raised, but there is no minimum we need to raise.     Why raise all this money if the brewery is already being built?     The more money we raise, the faster we are able to grow and to get BrewDog beer into the hands of more and more craft beer fans across the US. The more money we raise, the more BrewDog bars we can open in more cities. In our offering circular, we explain in more detail what we intend to do with the money raised.     Can anyone invest?    Yes, anyone can invest! Regulation A+ allows anyone to invest in our company, not just the fat cats and rich people with yachts and swimming pools who used to hold a monopoly over investment in companies like ours. With Regulation A+, BrewDog can accept investments from anyone, and you can become part of our craft beer revolution for as little at $95. We would much rather have the backing of craft beer fans who love and care about the beer we make, than just the rich folks on Wall Street.     How long will people be able to buy the stock?    Shares will be available until July 31, 2017 (subject to change), or until we raise a total of $50 million; whichever is sooner.      How do people pay for the stock?    When you click the Invest Now button on this page you will fill out a couple of forms and then have the opportunity to pay either by ACH (you electronically transfer the money from your bank account to a bank escrow account, who then releases it to us), BACS (a similar system to ACH available to UK investors), wire, or by check. Unfortunately, under US law, you cannot use a credit or debit card, but we still made the process as easy for you to follow as we are allowed to by law!     Will the stock be listed on an exchange like NASDAQ?    Eventually, that is our goal.  But for now, our shares are not publicly traded on any exchange.     How many shares of stock are available? What happens when they run out?    We started with a total of 1,052,632 shares to sell. The number available goes down every time a new Equity Punk joins our American craft beer revolution. When these shares run out, there are no more for sale in this offering.     Where do you plan on opening BrewDog bars?    We’re planning on launching a number of epic craft beer brew pubs and bars across the States. Initially, we have our sights set on Columbus, Ohio – we’ve secured an epic location in Franklinton – but we’ll also be looking at where we see hubs of investment from new Equity Punks, and bump any interesting regions up our list!   What happens if you raise less than $50 million?    We are building a world-class craft beer brewery in Columbus and coming to America, no matter how much money we raise. But, the more we raise, the faster we can grow, and the quicker we can recruit an amazing crew of craft beer crusaders as foot soldiers for BrewDog USA. Every dollar invested will be used to expand our US operations in order to spread our passion for great craft beer across this great country.    I heard about the private equity investment into BrewDog plc. How does that affect BrewDog USA Inc. and this offering? BrewDog plc is very excited about the minority investment into their UK company. However, to be clear, that investment was made into BrewDog plc, the UK parent company of BrewDog USA Inc., and not directly into BrewDog USA Inc., the company that is offering shares in this Regulation A offering. The private equity investment into BrewDog plc will have no effect on the price of the shares we are selling in this offering and it will not affect the terms of this offering in any way. However, our parent company is thrilled about the $264 million investment which gives BrewDog plc a $1.24 billion valuation. BrewDog plc intends to use those funds to continue its global growth and also to provide its shareholders with some liquidity for their investments into our parent company. For more on the announcement about the minority investment into our parent company, BrewDog plc, click here.    I have another question – who can I talk to?

BrewDog, the self-styled “punk” brewer, is seeking to raise up to $50m (£38m) from American ale enthusiasts to expand in the US despite only having a niche following in the world’s biggest craft beer market and no sales there for the past year.
The Scottish company has launched its biggest crowdfunding campaign by asking US consumers to buy at least two shares for $47.50 each of a new US company that will be valued at $250m.
The “equity for punks USA” fundraising will sell up to a fifth of BrewDog USA Inc, with the remainder owned by BrewDog and its existing 46,000 crowdfunded investors.
BrewDog has almost finished building a 9,000 sq metre (100,000 sq ft) brewery in Columbus, Ohio, scheduled to open this year. The company will use the money to finance production at the site and to open bars, depending on the amount raised.




The aggressive, outrageous, infuriating (and ingenious) rise of BrewDog

As in the UK, investors will get a range of perks, including 5% off drinks in BrewDog bars around the world, a free tour of the Columbus brewery and two tickets to the US company’s beer-fuelled annual meeting.
BrewDog has funded its rapid expansion in Britain and construction of the Columbus site by raising a total of £26m from small investors, many of whom were fans of its beer, in the past seven years. It is now seeking to raise substantially more than that in just six months from US beer fans.
BrewDog’s founder James Watt said he thought the share offer would be a success because of the enthusiasm for craft beer in the US and the attraction of owning a stake in a brewery. BrewDog has also raised its profile with a TV show about beer on the US Esquire network presented by Watt and his co-founder, Martin Dickie, he said.
BrewDog has sold beer in the US since 2008 through chains such as Whole Foods. But Watt said transporting the beer from Scotland made it more expensive and less fresh than it should be. BrewDog halted US sales a year ago to differentiate the older, pricier beer from the product that will be brewed in Columbus.
Watt said: “We’ve got a decent but small customer base but the logistics made it unfeasible to scale up our ambitions in the US without making beer there. 
“Hey, it’s a gamble. Will we be able to pull this off? Who knows? But it’s a great opportunity for people to make an investment in the business and as we’ve shown in the UK people make a fairly good return on their investment.”
The US is the fastest-growing craft beer market in the world with sales of $22.3bn, according to BrewDog. While total US beer consumption shrinks, craft beer is forecast to grow from 13% of the market to 20% by 2020.
Watt said $50m was the maximum BrewDog hoped to raise but only $5m was needed to kickstart beer production in Columbus. “It’s not $50m or go back to Scotland. It’s on a sliding scale,” he said. 
BrewDog chose Columbus in the midwest for its US base because craft beer is popular there but the market has plenty of room to grow, unlike on the east and west coasts.

Before buying Central Ohio-brewed BrewDog beer, fans will be able to buy into BrewDog itself.
The Scotland-based craft beer maker Wednesday announced details of its Equity for Punks USA program, which will sell up to 20 percent of BrewDog USA Inc. to American investors. The company is in the midst of its fourth round of such public investment in Europe and has been adamant it wanted to do a similar program here.

“Our innovative platform for growth puts the people that drink our beer at the centre of everything we do,” co-founder and CEO James Watt wrote.




He said the investment in establishing the brewhouse and opening BrewDog brewpubs across the country will be $25 million and funding raised through the program will go toward those projects. I asked BrewDog how and if that investment overlaps with the planned $30.4 million brewery in Canal Winchester, but have not yet heard back.
Some details are still to come — Equity for Punks USA will launch in May but the exact date has yet to be announced. Pricing hasn’t been announced either.
“Our U.S. lawyers and advisors are very confident in the proposed pricing for the U.S. business, supported by recent deals (such as the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point), the capacity we have built in Columbus and our brand reputation and locked-in distribution structure,” Watt wrote.
The company previously said it hopes to be brewing by August — about 14 months after the project was announced.




 


Watt said structural steel and the roof are completed. Walls are being installed and the German-based makers of the facility’s 170-barrel brewhouse will be in town soon to start installation.
Vice President of Sales Jason Davis is building the wholesale network with that expected to be in place by the time the brewery opens.
BrewDog raised more than $10.6 million in three previous campaigns in Europe and so far has drummed up more than $19.2 million of its $35.6 million goal in its latest Equity for Punks program on its home continent. That round ends in April.
Watt told me last fall that the programs have been essential to customer engagement and that while the crowdfunding helps accelerate projects, it isn’t necessary for project completion.

Super-High-Alcohol Beer Heads to the U.S.
European microbreweries like BrewDog are waging a battle to try to get you drunker, with high-alcohol beers like Tactical Nuclear Penguin. Is it good business? Or an example of irresponsible behavior?

Thanks to a war among European brewing companies, it's never been easier to catch a healthy beer buzz. Or get yourself totally sloshed. In November, BrewDog, a three-year-old Scottish microbrewery, released a new brand, dubbed Tactical Nuclear Penguin. The beer set a new record by weighing in at a scary 32% alcohol by volume (ABV), more than six times the strength of familiar domestic brands like Budweiser. As explained in a cheeky video on the company's website (warning: the clip contains simulated penguin sex), the brewery was able to attain the high alcohol content by freezing the beer at a local ice cream factory, at temperatures as low as -6°C (21°F), for 21 days. Alcohol freezes at lower temperatures than water, and removing water from the solution increased the alcohol concentration. 

Jim Watt, one of BrewDog's co-founders, says that some 400 bottles of Tactical Nuclear Penguin are in the process of being shipped to a few stores in California and New York City, including a Whole Foods location; about half of the consumers buying beer from the BrewDog website are from the U.S. Watt's eyes are clearly fixed on the American market. "We're keen to push the envelope," he says, "and challenge people's perceptions of how beer can be enjoyed." (See TIME Video Taste Test: Beer With Extra Buzz.) A warning label on the Tactical Nuclear Penguin bottle does state, "This is an extremely strong beer; it should be enjoyed in small servings and with an air of aristocratic nonchalance. It is exactly the same manner you would enjoy a fine whisky, a Frank Zappa album or a visit from a friendly yet anxious ghost."
 
Some alcohol-watchdog groups aren't laughing. The chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, Jack Law, has blasted BrewDog's high-alcohol products as "irresponsible," especially at a time when Scotland is experiencing "severe alcohol-related problems." In December, BrewDog received a slap on the wrist from a British alcohol regulatory body, the Portman Group, which ordered that retailers pull the company's 18.2% Tokyo beer brand off shelves because of its marketing tactics. A note on the Tokyo label says, "It is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times." After the beer was pulled, BrewDog came out with a 1.1% ABV brew meant to tame the critics. Its name: Nanny State. (See how Americans are spending now.) The drinking games continued in February when a German brewer, Schorschbrau, released a 40% ABV beer called Schorschbock. The BrewDog boys fired back a few weeks later with high-octane concoction Sink the Bismarck!, which checks in at 41%, enough to reclaim the "world's strongest beer" mantle (the name is a not-so-subtle reference to the famous German battleship deployed during World War II). 
 
For now, Sink the Bismarck! is only available for purchase on BrewDog's website, and the 500 or so bottles that BrewDog has produced are already sold out. Watt promises that more are on the way. Because of the painstaking process involved with producing such a strong drink, an 11.2-oz. bottle of Sink the Bismarck! costs some $60, minus shipping. Tactical Nuclear Penguin costs about $53 a bottle, and can also be ordered online. (See reviews of 50 American wines.) Even if these brands end up being carried by more bars and retailers, Watt firmly believes that the high prices will prohibit unsophisticated drinkers (read: high school kids at a kegger, or college students on spring break) from just picking up the stuff and chugging it. But you can't deny that if the beer becomes more widely available in stores, or if other brewers mimic BrewDog's strategy, it could become hazardous. Since most drinkers don't check the alcohol level on the label like they would the expiration date on a milk carton, an unsuspecting soul with money to spare could sip a little too much strong stuff. 
 
"We're all for responsible consumption," Watt says. But as we all know, beer and responsibility often don't mix. So enjoy the beer wars at your own risk.

Products[edit]
BrewDog produces bottled and canned beers in a variety of styles such as ale, stout, India pale ale (IPA) and lager, some of which are also available in keg containers.
The bottled beers are distributed to British supermarkets and exported worldwide; kegs are available in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and in a selection of other countries around the world. In 2012, cask ale production was phased out. BrewDog produces about 2.2 million bottles and 400,000 cans per month in October 2015.
History[edit]
BrewDog was founded in Fraserburgh in 2007 by James Watt and Martin Dickie.
In 2010, BrewDog opened their first bar, in nearby Aberdeen.[1] A second bar opened in 2011 in Edinburgh[2] followed by a third in Glasgow[3] and another in Camden Town, London.[4] Further bars opened in Nottingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham in 2012[5][6][7][8][9] and in Leeds, Stockholm and Shepherd's Bush, London in 2013.[10][11][12][13] In 2014, BrewDog opened bars in São Paulo, Brazil,[14] Dundee,[15] Florence, Italy, Gothenburg, Sweden and Helsinki, Finland.[16] There is also a bar located on Bethnal Green Road near Brick Lane in London.
In 2011, BrewDog was described as "...one of the prime movers..."[17] behind the campaign which changed the law in 2011 to allow new beer measures in Britain.[18]
2011 also saw the company offered crowdfunding shares totalling £2 million, the equivalent of 8% of the capital of the company. The shares were sold at ₤3.75 and accompanied several benefits such as discounts in their bars and online purchase of their beers, or the opportunity to attend their Annual Shareholders meeting.[19]
The main brewing moved from Fraserburgh to nearby Ellon in 2012.
In February 2016, BrewDog open-sourced its beer recipes to the public, making them a form of Free Beer.[20][21]
Private equity firm, TSG Consumer Partners acquired a 22% stake in the company for approximately £213 million in April 2017.[22]
Controversy[edit]
BrewDog's provocative marketing has been a key aspect of its business, and has gained them substantial international coverage.[23]
In 2008, BrewDog were challenged by UK drinks industry watchdog the Portman Group. Portman had claimed BrewDog to be in breach of their Code of Practice.[24] BrewDog denied these allegations and countered that Portman was impeding the development of smaller brewing companies.[25] In December 2008, after an 8-month long dispute and a preliminary adjudication which had ruled against the company, BrewDog were cleared of all breaches of the Code of Practice and were permitted to continue marketing their brands without making any changes to the packaging.[26] In protest to their targeting, BrewDog introduced "Speedball", saying "...we thought we would give them something worth banning us for...". Speedball was promptly banned by Portman[27] before being renamed as "Dogma".[28]
BrewDog has produced progressively stronger beers of very high strength, and has laid claim to the title 'strongest beer ever brewed' on more than one occasion.

In 2009, its "Tokyo*" brew caused controversy when UK watchdog the Portman Group criticised the availability of a beer of that strength in 330 ml bottles with traditional crown corks.
Also in 2009, BrewDog launched a beer called "Tactical Nuclear Penguin", with 32% alcohol, which was claimed to be the strongest beer ever made.[29]
In 2010, BrewDog announced "Sink The Bismarck", an apparent 41% ABV[30][31] to reclaim the World's Strongest Beer title from Schorschbräu, who had produced a 40% ABV version of their Schorschbock.[32]
Also in 2010, BrewDog produced a 55% ABV freeze-distilled beer called "The End of History", with the bottles packaged in small stuffed animals, priced at £500 and £700 each.[33][34][35] Only 12 bottles were produced; 11 for retail sale, with the other one going to Internet video blog BeerTapTV.[36][37] BrewDog claimed that this set new records not only for alcoholic strength in a beer, but also for price. Advocates for Animals called the gimmick 'perverse'.[33]

The title "strongest beer of the world" then fell back to Mr Tscheuschner from the Schorschbräu brewery in Germany, whose Schorschbock 57 boasts an ABV of 57.5%.[38] The title for world's strongest beer has since changed again though, allegedly to Brewmeister's "Snake Venom" at a reputed 67.5%, although independent testing has yet to be published to confirm the ABV.[39]
In March 2017, BrewDog threatened legal action against an independent pub based in Birmingham, England called "Lone Wolf", a trademark owned by BrewDog. This led to accusations of hypocrisy and mockery of its 'punk' ethos.[40] A day later, after the story was reported in The Guardian, BrewDog director James Watt confirmed via Twitter that the company had no issue allowing the bar to use the name "Lone Wolf", despite it having already rebranded as "The Wolf".[41] The next day, further controversy arose over an alleged previous threat of legal action from BrewDog against a bar calling itself "Draft Punk" (in reference to the band Daft Punk).[42] BrewDog's Watt later released a blog statement citing the allegation as inaccurate, calling it an example of "opportunistic lies combined with inaccurate journalism", noting that BrewDog does also own the 'Punk' trademark for beer.[43]
Awards[edit]
BrewDog won the 2008 Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust Young Entrepreneur of the Year award.[44]
Paradox Grain won a Gold Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup in the Wood and Barrel-aged Strong Beer Category.[45]
BrewDog won the Tenon Entrepreneur of the Year Award for demonstrating exceptional vision and leadership at the 2008 National Business Awards for Scotland.[46]
The Physics won World's Best Strong Pale Ale (Sub Category Winner) and Rip Tide won World's Best Imperial Stout (Style Trophy Winner) at the 2007 World Beer Awards, an annual competition organised by Beers of the World magazine.[47]
Hardcore IPA won Gold at the 2010 World Beer Cup in the Imperial IPA category.[48]
In 2012, BrewDog revealed that Diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from BII Scotland's annual awards if BrewDog was named winner of the Best Bar Operator award.[49] Diageo later apologised to BrewDog for what they called a "serious misjudgement by Diageo staff".[50][51]

In February 2016, BrewDog open-sourced its beer recipes to the public, making them a form of Free Beer.[20][21]
Private equity firm, TSG Consumer Partners acquired a 22% stake in the company for approximately £213 million in April 2017.[22]
Controversy[edit]
BrewDog's provocative marketing has been a key aspect of its business, and has gained them substantial international coverage.[23]
In 2008, BrewDog were challenged by UK drinks industry watchdog the Portman Group. Portman had claimed BrewDog to be in breach of their Code of Practice.[24] BrewDog denied these allegations and countered that Portman was impeding the development of smaller brewing companies.[25] In December 2008, after an 8-month long dispute and a preliminary adjudication which had ruled against the company, BrewDog were cleared of all breaches of the Code of Practice and were permitted to continue marketing their brands without making any changes to the packaging.[26] In protest to their targeting, BrewDog introduced "Speedball", saying "...we thought we would give them something worth banning us for...". Speedball was promptly banned by Portman[27] before being renamed as "Dogma".[28]
BrewDog has produced progressively stronger beers of very high strength, and has laid claim to the title 'strongest beer ever brewed' on more than one occasion.

In 2009, its "Tokyo*" brew caused controversy when UK watchdog the Portman Group criticised the availability of a beer of that strength in 330 ml bottles with traditional crown corks.
Also in 2009, BrewDog launched a beer called "Tactical Nuclear Penguin", with 32% alcohol, which was claimed to be the strongest beer ever made.[29]
In 2010, BrewDog announced "Sink The Bismarck", an apparent 41% ABV[30][31] to reclaim the World's Strongest Beer title from Schorschbräu, who had produced a 40% ABV version of their Schorschbock.[32]
Also in 2010, BrewDog produced a 55% ABV freeze-distilled beer called "The End of History", with the bottles packaged in small stuffed animals, priced at £500 and £700 each.[33][34][35] Only 12 bottles were produced; 11 for retail sale, with the other one going to Internet video blog BeerTapTV.[36][37] BrewDog claimed that this set new records not only for alcoholic strength in a beer, but also for price. Advocates for Animals called the gimmick 'perverse'.[33]

The title "strongest beer of the world" then fell back to Mr Tscheuschner from the Schorschbräu brewery in Germany, whose Schorschbock 57 boasts an ABV of 57.5%.[38] The title for world's strongest beer has since changed again though, allegedly to Brewmeister's "Snake Venom" at a reputed 67.5%, although independent testing has yet to be published to confirm the ABV.[39]
In March 2017, BrewDog threatened legal action against an independent pub based in Birmingham, England called "Lone Wolf", a trademark owned by BrewDog. This led to accusations of hypocrisy and mockery of its 'punk' ethos.[40] A day later, after the story was reported in The Guardian, BrewDog director James Watt confirmed via Twitter that the company had no issue allowing the bar to use the name "Lone Wolf", despite it having already rebranded as "The Wolf".[41] The next day, further controversy arose over an alleged previous threat of legal action from BrewDog against a bar calling itself "Draft Punk" (in reference to the band Daft Punk).[42] BrewDog's Watt later released a blog statement citing the allegation as inaccurate, calling it an example of "opportunistic lies combined with inaccurate journalism", noting that BrewDog does also own the 'Punk' trademark for beer.[43]
Awards[edit]
BrewDog won the 2008 Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust Young Entrepreneur of the Year award.[44]
Paradox Grain won a Gold Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup in the Wood and Barrel-aged Strong Beer Category.[45]
BrewDog won the Tenon Entrepreneur of the Year Award for demonstrating exceptional vision and leadership at the 2008 National Business Awards for Scotland.[46]
The Physics won World's Best Strong Pale Ale (Sub Category Winner) and Rip Tide won World's Best Imperial Stout (Style Trophy Winner) at the 2007 World Beer Awards, an annual competition organised by Beers of the World magazine.[47]
Hardcore IPA won Gold at the 2010 World Beer Cup in the Imperial IPA category.[48]
In 2012, BrewDog revealed that Diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from BII Scotland's annual awards if BrewDog was named winner of the Best Bar Operator award.[49] Diageo later apologised to BrewDog for what they called a "serious misjudgement by Diageo staff".[50][51]

Products[edit]
BrewDog produces bottled and canned beers in a variety of styles such as ale, stout, India pale ale (IPA) and lager, some of which are also available in keg containers.
The bottled beers are distributed to British supermarkets and exported worldwide; kegs are available in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and in a selection of other countries around the world. In 2012, cask ale production was phased out. BrewDog produces about 2.2 million bottles and 400,000 cans per month in October 2015.
History[edit]
BrewDog was founded in Fraserburgh in 2007 by James Watt and Martin Dickie.
In 2010, BrewDog opened their first bar, in nearby Aberdeen.[1] A second bar opened in 2011 in Edinburgh[2] followed by a third in Glasgow[3] and another in Camden Town, London.[4] Further bars opened in Nottingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham in 2012[5][6][7][8][9] and in Leeds, Stockholm and Shepherd's Bush, London in 2013.[10][11][12][13] In 2014, BrewDog opened bars in São Paulo, Brazil,[14] Dundee,[15] Florence, Italy, Gothenburg, Sweden and Helsinki, Finland.[16] There is also a bar located on Bethnal Green Road near Brick Lane in London.
In 2011, BrewDog was described as "...one of the prime movers..."[17] behind the campaign which changed the law in 2011 to allow new beer measures in Britain.[18]
2011 also saw the company offered crowdfunding shares totalling £2 million, the equivalent of 8% of the capital of the company. The shares were sold at ₤3.75 and accompanied several benefits such as discounts in their bars and online purchase of their beers, or the opportunity to attend their Annual Shareholders meeting.[19]
The main brewing moved from Fraserburgh to nearby Ellon in 2012.
In February 2016, BrewDog open-sourced its beer recipes to the public, making them a form of Free Beer.[20][21]
Private equity firm, TSG Consumer Partners acquired a 22% stake in the company for approximately £213 million in April 2017.[22]
Controversy[edit]
BrewDog's provocative marketing has been a key aspect of its business, and has gained them substantial international coverage.[23]
In 2008, BrewDog were challenged by UK drinks industry watchdog the Portman Group. Portman had claimed BrewDog to be in breach of their Code of Practice.[24] BrewDog denied these allegations and countered that Portman was impeding the development of smaller brewing companies.[25] In December 2008, after an 8-month long dispute and a preliminary adjudication which had ruled against the company, BrewDog were cleared of all breaches of the Code of Practice and were permitted to continue marketing their brands without making any changes to the packaging.[26] In protest to their targeting, BrewDog introduced "Speedball", saying "...we thought we would give them something worth banning us for...". Speedball was promptly banned by Portman[27] before being renamed as "Dogma".[28]
BrewDog has produced progressively stronger beers of very high strength, and has laid claim to the title 'strongest beer ever brewed' on more than one occasion.

In 2009, its "Tokyo*" brew caused controversy when UK watchdog the Portman Group criticised the availability of a beer of that strength in 330 ml bottles with traditional crown corks.
Also in 2009, BrewDog launched a beer called "Tactical Nuclear Penguin", with 32% alcohol, which was claimed to be the strongest beer ever made.[29]
In 2010, BrewDog announced "Sink The Bismarck", an apparent 41% ABV[30][31] to reclaim the World's Strongest Beer title from Schorschbräu, who had produced a 40% ABV version of their Schorschbock.[32]
Also in 2010, BrewDog produced a 55% ABV freeze-distilled beer called "The End of History", with the bottles packaged in small stuffed animals, priced at £500 and £700 each.[33][34][35] Only 12 bottles were produced; 11 for retail sale, with the other one going to Internet video blog BeerTapTV.[36][37] BrewDog claimed that this set new records not only for alcoholic strength in a beer, but also for price. Advocates for Animals called the gimmick 'perverse'.[33]

The title "strongest beer of the world" then fell back to Mr Tscheuschner from the Schorschbräu brewery in Germany, whose Schorschbock 57 boasts an ABV of 57.5%.[38] The title for world's strongest beer has since changed again though, allegedly to Brewmeister's "Snake Venom" at a reputed 67.5%, although independent testing has yet to be published to confirm the ABV.[39]
In March 2017, BrewDog threatened legal action against an independent pub based in Birmingham, England called "Lone Wolf", a trademark owned by BrewDog. This led to accusations of hypocrisy and mockery of its 'punk' ethos.[40] A day later, after the story was reported in The Guardian, BrewDog director James Watt confirmed via Twitter that the company had no issue allowing the bar to use the name "Lone Wolf", despite it having already rebranded as "The Wolf".[41] The next day, further controversy arose over an alleged previous threat of legal action from BrewDog against a bar calling itself "Draft Punk" (in reference to the band Daft Punk).[42] BrewDog's Watt later released a blog statement citing the allegation as inaccurate, calling it an example of "opportunistic lies combined with inaccurate journalism", noting that BrewDog does also own the 'Punk' trademark for beer.[43]
Awards[edit]
BrewDog won the 2008 Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust Young Entrepreneur of the Year award.[44]
Paradox Grain won a Gold Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup in the Wood and Barrel-aged Strong Beer Category.[45]
BrewDog won the Tenon Entrepreneur of the Year Award for demonstrating exceptional vision and leadership at the 2008 National Business Awards for Scotland.[46]
The Physics won World's Best Strong Pale Ale (Sub Category Winner) and Rip Tide won World's Best Imperial Stout (Style Trophy Winner) at the 2007 World Beer Awards, an annual competition organised by Beers of the World magazine.[47]
Hardcore IPA won Gold at the 2010 World Beer Cup in the Imperial IPA category.[48]
In 2012, BrewDog revealed that Diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from BII Scotland's annual awards if BrewDog was named winner of the Best Bar Operator award.[49] Diageo later apologised to BrewDog for what they called a "serious misjudgement by Diageo staff".[50][51]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
