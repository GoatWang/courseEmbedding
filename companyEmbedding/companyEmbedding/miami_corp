Miami Corp’s New Product Lines Features the Latest Vinyls, Fabrics, Accessories and More



Share Article


















The new product lines at Miami Corp shows how the company continuously looks to offer the latest, most innovative products available to the marine and automotive markets.







Miami Corporation



Cincinnati, OH (PRWEB)
March 27, 2014
 Miami Corporation, http://www.miamicorp.com, always on the cutting edge when it comes to providing the latest for the automotive, awning, marine, and upholstery industries, among others,  announces several new products featuring the latest in vinyls, fabrics, accessories for the shop, and more. 
Among Miami Corporation’s latest additions are exciting new options in the Platinum and vinyl lines. These new options include:
Lunar–This is a marine grade PVC and a perfect option for those wanting the look and feel of a polyurethane without the costs associated with it. Actually formulated for all markets with built-in marine specs, this hybrid vinyl has it all. It’s pliable, UV treated, mildew resistant and abrasion defiant. 
Platinum–Often referred to as the “game changer” in the marine seating fabrics arena.  Platinum is ideal for those demanding polyurethane at a conservative price. This easy-to-clean PU offers high-end style with a soft supple hand, plus strength and durability for long-term use. 
Armada–This traditional PVC has a vast color palette, great hand, and sews easily. It’s perfect for those with tight budgets and is a go-to for every shop.  
In addition to those new lines, Miami Corp introduces the MPF – Rubber Edge Swivel Pad Mooring Pole Base. The pole base makes installing boat covers quick and easy with the ability to swivel and hold the pole in place to assist in getting a boat cover on quickly. The thermoplastic rubber glove gives the pad a firm grip without the worry of scratching or wearing away a boat’s flooring. Its large pad protects boats from damage caused by standard crutch tips and it disperses the pole’s weight making it usable on all flooring surfaces.
Mordura, an attractive 11 sku, high-tech knit fabric is comprised of both nylon and polyester yarns, yielding exceptional strength. It has been the fabric of choice for the automotive market providing Class 8 heavy duty truck seating for over thirty-five years. Mordura is built to last, providing high style and a luxurious touch. 
Miami Corp is also offering built-tough, made-to-last consumer products such as the KAI 700 Series Shears. No shop should be without these stainless steel shears that have an extra-long edge life and superior cutting efficiency. Designed for professional use, these tailoring style shears are ideal for pattern cutting and so much more.

Share Article


















With the latest additions to their product lines, Miami Corporation continues to lead the industry in cutting-edge, sturdy, and stylish fabrics for indoor and outdoor use.







Miami Corporation



Cincinnati, OH (PRWEB)
April 25, 2014
 The latest fabrics and accessories for the marine, automotive, and awning  industries are now available at Miami Corporation, http://www.miamicorp.com, and featured in the company’s latest catalog, April News. 
Among the newest additions are exciting options for awning and marine, which include:  
Recsystem – New from Recasens, Recsystem is a woven, 100-percent solution-dyed acrylic fabric with an acrylic resin back coating.  This fabric offers a unique combination of beauty and protection, by combining the rich color and natural woven look of Recacril solution-dyed acrylic fabric with the added protection of a durable proprietary resin back coating. Available in 20 acrylic solids.
KIXX - Just in time for boating season, Morbern Marine offers several new options including KIXX. This new vinyl upholstery product, with a three-dimensional mesh texture and sporty high fashion colors, adds a modern look to interior and exterior applications.
Sundance – Sophisticated style with a touch of sunlit shimmer, this durable, versatile fabric comes in 10 dynamic colors with build-ins such as being anti-bacterial/anti-microbial and abrasion, mildew, and UV resistant.  
New in the Automotive Collection:
Reno Leather Collection – This colorful leather/vinyl matching product offers an extensive color pallet to satisfy every interior need.  This premium quality, all-purpose leather and vinyl line, consists of OEM color matchups for most domestic and foreign vehicles. 
Autotuft Carpet Collection – This collection includes the Finetuft velour polypropylene in 33 colors, perfect for Mercedes, BMWs, Lexus, Audis, Porsches, and the Infinity.  The Wood Square Weave is available in 16 colors and is the first choice for Porsches, Mercedes, and Volkswagens among others.  And the English Wilton II wool is a sturdy wool fabric carpet, available in 21 colors, and perfect for Jaguars, Bentleys, Ferraris, and Land Rovers.
As the Director of Marketing, Kerry Niehaus, states, “Our tagline for our April News Catalog says it all.  We take pride in differentiating ourselves by providing innovative products and stellar service at affordable prices. We are also pleased to welcome a new sales representative to our team, John Thoms.”
John has an extensive background dating back to 1986 and will be focusing on awning accounts in the Midwest and Texas. In addition to years of experience, including logging the highest sales growth by dollars and percentage, and being named the Inaugural Sales Person of the Year for 2012, John is also a member of IFAI and the IIK Zone group.  John states, “The extensive product offerings within the awning line and the amazing service and pricing offered by Miami Corp, gives awning manufacturers a choice in suppliers again. Something they have not had in nearly a decade or so.”

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
