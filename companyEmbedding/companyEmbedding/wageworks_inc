WageWorks
About Us
{Helping People Lead Healthier, Happier and More Productive Lives}




About WageWorks®
WageWorks cares about people and wants to empower everyone—employers, employees, and their families—to lead healthier, happier, and more productive lives.
We simplify the complex world of Consumer-Directed Benefits. We make benefits programs easier to understand and use so that everyone can take advantage of pre-tax savings and focus on what matters most. 








What DoesWageWorks Do?







Administering World-ClassPre-Tax Benefits



Expand








WageWorks is a leading on-demand provider of Consumer-Directed Benefits (CDBs) in the United States.
CDBs are tax-advantaged programs for consumer-directed health, commuter, and other employee spending account benefits. We administer and operate a broad array of CDBs, including:

Spending account management programs, such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health savings account (HSAs), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs)
Commuter benefits, such as transit and parking programs

 
Our CDB programs enable employees and their families to save money by using pre-tax dollars to pay for their healthcare and commuter expenses. Employers financially benefit from our programs through reduced payroll taxes, even after factoring in our fees. Under our FSA, HSA, and commuter programs, employee participants contribute funds from their pre-tax income to pay for qualified out-of-pocket healthcare expenses not fully covered by insurance, such as co-pays, deductibles, and over-the-counter medical products or for commuting costs.
 
WageWorks is a public and independent company, which enables us to scale quickly and effectively, influence legislation and provide leadership and expertise in the field of Consumer-Directed Benefits, ensuring the best of breed programs for your company and employees. We understand the cost pressures associated with administering benefits. With our experience we strive to more expertly and more cost-efficiently deliver these benefits than employers can themselves.
 
We deliver our CDB programs through a highly scalable Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, delivery model that employer clients and their employee participants may access through a standard web browser on any internet enabled device, including computers, smart phones, and other mobile devices, such as tablet computers. Our on-demand delivery model eliminates the need for our employer clients to install and maintain hardware and software in order to support CDB programs and enables us to rapidly implement product enhancements across our entire user base.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

WageWorks
About Us
{Helping People Lead Healthier, Happier and More Productive Lives}




About WageWorks®
WageWorks cares about people and wants to empower everyone—employers, employees, and their families—to lead healthier, happier, and more productive lives.
We simplify the complex world of Consumer-Directed Benefits. We make benefits programs easier to understand and use so that everyone can take advantage of pre-tax savings and focus on what matters most. 








What DoesWageWorks Do?







Administering World-ClassPre-Tax Benefits



Expand








WageWorks is a leading on-demand provider of Consumer-Directed Benefits (CDBs) in the United States.
CDBs are tax-advantaged programs for consumer-directed health, commuter, and other employee spending account benefits. We administer and operate a broad array of CDBs, including:

Spending account management programs, such as health and dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health savings account (HSAs), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs)
Commuter benefits, such as transit and parking programs

 
Our CDB programs enable employees and their families to save money by using pre-tax dollars to pay for their healthcare and commuter expenses. Employers financially benefit from our programs through reduced payroll taxes, even after factoring in our fees. Under our FSA, HSA, and commuter programs, employee participants contribute funds from their pre-tax income to pay for qualified out-of-pocket healthcare expenses not fully covered by insurance, such as co-pays, deductibles, and over-the-counter medical products or for commuting costs.
 
WageWorks is a public and independent company, which enables us to scale quickly and effectively, influence legislation and provide leadership and expertise in the field of Consumer-Directed Benefits, ensuring the best of breed programs for your company and employees. We understand the cost pressures associated with administering benefits. With our experience we strive to more expertly and more cost-efficiently deliver these benefits than employers can themselves.
 
We deliver our CDB programs through a highly scalable Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, delivery model that employer clients and their employee participants may access through a standard web browser on any internet enabled device, including computers, smart phones, and other mobile devices, such as tablet computers. Our on-demand delivery model eliminates the need for our employer clients to install and maintain hardware and software in order to support CDB programs and enables us to rapidly implement product enhancements across our entire user base.

										I have an account with wageworks; they have provided me with a 'commuter card' with which I can purchase my monthly transit pass. I had a regular scheduled deduction from my wageworks account to my commuter card so I could purchase my transit passes. 
At some point last year these deductions stopped without explanation and as of late last year I have not been able to use my commuter card to purchase my transit pass and I have had to purchase my transit pass using my own personal card. 
For two months I have been trying to ask wageworks to transfer my account funds to the commuter card, and for two months they have failed to do so after repeated phone calls and assertions that it has been done. On the last phone call, they asserted that the funds would be transferred later this month, which means I have to pay for the transit pass out of my own pocket, again. 
I would simply withdraw my funds from wageworks and not use them again in the future, but have since learned that they do not offer refunds. As such, I am frustrated by their incomplete and slow delivery of products that is actually costing me money; I very much feel like that they are holding my money hostage.

					Full Description



WageWorks, Inc., incorporated on January 28, 2000, is engaged in administering Consumer-Directed Benefits (CDBs). The Company administers CBDs, including pre-tax spending accounts, such as Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), health and dependent care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), and Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), as well as Commuter Benefit Services, including transit and parking programs, wellness programs, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) and other employee benefits. The Company's CDB programs assist employees and their families in saving money by using pre-tax dollars to pay for certain of their healthcare, dependent care and commuter expenses. Employers financially benefit from its programs through reduced payroll taxes. The Company provides operational support services to its clients and its cross-functional teams, including customer support and claims processing.The Company administers HSAs for employers that allow employee participants to invest funds to be used for qualified healthcare expenses at any time without federal tax liability or penalty. The Company's HSA programs are designed to offer employers a choice of third-party custodian, as well as a range of investment options within each custodial offering that enables employers the opportunity to explore various funds to offer their employees.The Company offers FSAs, which are employer-sponsored CDBs that enable employees to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for eligible healthcare expenses that are not generally covered by insurance, such as co-pays, deductibles and over-the-counter medical products, as well as vision expenses, orthodontia, medical devices and autism treatments. Employers benefit from payroll tax savings on the pre-tax FSA contributions made by the employee. The Company also administers FSA programs for dependent care plans. Its dependent care plans allow employees to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for eligible dependent care expenses, which typically include child care or day care expenses, as well as expenses incurred from adult and elder care.The Company offers employer-funded HRAs. Under HRAs, employers provide their employees with a specified amount of reimbursement funds that are available to help employees defray their out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, such as deductibles, co-insurance and co-payments. The Company administers pre-tax commuter benefit programs. Employers are permitted to provide employees with commuter benefits, including qualified parking, transit passes, vanpooling and bicycle commuting reimbursement.The Company offers COBRA continuation services to employer clients to meet the employer's obligation to make available continuation of coverage for participants who are no longer eligible for the employer's COBRA covered benefits, including medical, dental, vision, HRAs and certain healthcare FSAs. As part of its COBRA program, the Company offers a direct billing service where former employee participants pay the Company directly versus to their employers for coverage they elect to continue. The Company handles the accounting and customer service for these separated employees, as well as interfacing with the carrier regarding the employees' eligibility.The Company runs its services primarily on three enterprise platforms based on an on-demand delivery model that employer clients and their employee participants may access through a standard Web browser on any Internet-enabled device, including computers, smart phones, and other mobile devices, such as tablet computers. Its on-demand delivery model eliminates the need for its employer clients to install and maintain hardware and software in order to support CDB programs and enables it to implement product enhancements across its entire user base. The Company's platforms include v5, WinFlexOne and Complink.The v5 platform supports various account administrative functions and provides integration with the systems used by employer clients, payment networks, health plans and key suppliers. Its v5 platform features a rules-based engine that includes multi-wallet functionality and is configurable to accommodate custom client plan designs and service requests. The WinFlexOne is designed and enhanced to address the needs of small-and medium-sized business (SMBs). The Complink is used to provide COBRA and direct bill services to its SMB and enterprise clients. This features integrated platform automates COBRA and direct bill administration activities and operations, and helps to ensure the administration of these programs is in compliance with applicable laws.

WAGE Crosses Above Average Analyst Target
In recent trading, shares of WageWorks Inc have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $60.75, changing hands for $60.94/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







I was quite satisfied with the service and all was as expected. May be for others their HR should have worked better, but I can't complain and all was calculated and worked.







I think wageworks does a great job for companies in healthcare. Much better than others I hv had to deal with. Most importantly, their mobile app is awesome and the easiest tech tool I've used







Just filed my claims all at once, at the end of the year...   so easy, so quick... the website and the mobile app are great.   Definitely the best FSA and HSA provider I've used (across all of my employers).  Thanks WageWorks, for getting it right.







Getting my claims filed was easypeasy.. Wageworks has an app that allows me to take a picture of my daughter's monthly daycare receipts and submit them online. I also have direct deposit setup and my reimbursements goes straight to my bank account-- sweet. Enrollments are coming up and hopefully that also goes just as smooth. We previously used PayFlex and Wageworks has a much better self service web site.

Some of these reviews crack up and all seem to directed towards their customer service. Guess those folks want to vent and yelp gives them just the means to do so. I never had to or needed to talk to customer service and reading some reviews, I hope I never have to :) 

My recommendation is to use their online web site (or mobile app if you have a smart phone) to submit a claim and not call customer service to submit a claim. 

So far so good.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







So far I have not had a problem with them for my medical spending account. But looking at the reviews is worrisome. My husband has a MSA with another company, OutsourceOne, and they have been awful (see my review). The big excuse is always something about the IRS requirements. One more reason not to have government in our Health care. This is just more bureaucracy and busy work. 

This process creates jobs for the unskilled GED types who sut in offices telling us IF and HOW we can use our own money to go to the doctor. In the meantime, I bet all those IRS desk people are getting better benefits than all of us. I doubt they have to deal with this type of busy work to pay for care because they probably don't even have a co payment

.







Wage Works will oftentimes assign arbitrary "service dates" to Dependent Care Accounts outside of your plan year resulting in the disallowance of reimbursement claims.  The bottom line is this -

WageWorks will take your money and find a way to disallow your claims.

In the American legal system, this is known as theft.

Update - I complained about this problem and after getting a little bit of a runaround, Wage Works reprocessed my claim and released the funds they had improperly withheld without reimbursement.  Still not a big fan of Wage Works overall because of the headaches of trying to get money out of my account, but they do an acceptable job.







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I must agree with most people here and I hope the CEO will pay attention to what their customers are saying. I went to a well known drug store today to purchase OTC pain reliever. My Wageworks debit card was declined, defeating the whole purpose of having the debit card. Customer service (I suspect overseas) was not helpful at all. The website is not helpful either. I was going to rate them 1 star but gave an additional star for having a decent mobile app. I was able to take a snap shot of the receipt and submit the claim from my smart phone. I was relieved to find out that my employer is using a different provider next year.







My employer uses this company for healthcare FSA.  They are fine when charges to my FSA debit card are blatantly obvious, like from a hospital, but struggle with anything else.  I had to waste my time sending in receipts from a dental visit (billing dentist was called University of Penn Dental Care Network) because 'the IRS demands verification of all expenses and we were unable to verify the services...".  Gee whiz, what exactly do they think a Dental Care Network provides?  Nail polish?  Broadway show tickets?  Ridiculous!  If anyone there had common sense, they would not make me waste my time digging up receipts to verify obvious claims.  What a PITA!  For me to get access to my own money!!







generally wageworks has been fine as long as the transactions have been within the accepted guidelines. I have been able to submit requesting documents with the appropriate documentation to get my claims approved. After reading the other reviews, I worried about what would happen if I had a transaction that wasn't so straightforward.

However, the 2 stars is for their horrible customer service line.  I don't know if their customer service is outsourced, but it feels that way.  The reps can't provide you with any meaningful information and they seem like they read off a script.  If you ask them anything out of the ordinary, they can't provide an answer and they actually seem stumped!  I felt that my call was a complete waste of time and at the end of it, I was so irritated.  You could do yourself a favor and try to look up the answer online, you would have a better chance of finding the answer than talking to the robots at customer service.







My wife participated with Wage Work's commuter benefits.  She has her money taken out of her pay check every month and they are suppose to reimbursed her the following month for her monthly Parking fees located in downtown.

 She had no issue getting her reimbursements until now.   This month, she went to Wage Works' site to file for her November reimbursement, the money is denied by Wage Works.  Nothing we can do about it.  We attempted to resolve this issue and we were told we weren't going to get the money.  We are thinking about filing a small claims against Wage Works.

Give your money to them at your own risk.







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Wage Works will oftentimes assign arbitrary "service dates" to Dependent Care Accounts outside of your plan year resulting in the disallowance of reimbursement claims.  The bottom line is this -WageWorks will take your money and find a way to disallow your claims.In the American legal system, this is known as theft.Update - I complained about this problem and after getting a little bit of a runaround, Wage Works reprocessed my claim and released the funds they had improperly withheld without reimbursement.  Still not a big fan of Wage Works overall because of the headaches of trying to get money out of my account, but they do an acceptable job.

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

I must agree with most people here and I hope the CEO will pay attention to what their customers are saying. I went to a well known drug store today to purchase OTC pain reliever. My Wageworks debit card was declined, defeating the whole purpose of having the debit card. Customer service (I suspect overseas) was not helpful at all. The website is not helpful either. I was going to rate them 1 star but gave an additional star for having a decent mobile app. I was able to take a snap shot of the receipt and submit the claim from my smart phone. I was relieved to find out that my employer is using a different provider next year.

My employer uses this company for healthcare FSA.  They are fine when charges to my FSA debit card are blatantly obvious, like from a hospital, but struggle with anything else.  I had to waste my time sending in receipts from a dental visit (billing dentist was called University of Penn Dental Care Network) because 'the IRS demands verification of all expenses and we were unable to verify the services...".  Gee whiz, what exactly do they think a Dental Care Network provides?  Nail polish?  Broadway show tickets?  Ridiculous!  If anyone there had common sense, they would not make me waste my time digging up receipts to verify obvious claims.  What a PITA!  For me to get access to my own money!!

generally wageworks has been fine as long as the transactions have been within the accepted guidelines. I have been able to submit requesting documents with the appropriate documentation to get my claims approved. After reading the other reviews, I worried about what would happen if I had a transaction that wasn't so straightforward.However, the 2 stars is for their horrible customer service line.  I don't know if their customer service is outsourced, but it feels that way.  The reps can't provide you with any meaningful information and they seem like they read off a script.  If you ask them anything out of the ordinary, they can't provide an answer and they actually seem stumped!  I felt that my call was a complete waste of time and at the end of it, I was so irritated.  You could do yourself a favor and try to look up the answer online, you would have a better chance of finding the answer than talking to the robots at customer service.

My wife participated with Wage Work's commuter benefits.  She has her money taken out of her pay check every month and they are suppose to reimbursed her the following month for her monthly Parking fees located in downtown. She had no issue getting her reimbursements until now.   This month, she went to Wage Works' site to file for her November reimbursement, the money is denied by Wage Works.  Nothing we can do about it.  We attempted to resolve this issue and we were told we weren't going to get the money.  We are thinking about filing a small claims against Wage Works.Give your money to them at your own risk.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







Commuter service is horrible. You will lose more than you save in Tax. And if you call / chat with customer care they will eat up hours with NO output except frustration.







Thieves, lairs, take your money. Don't use you lose it. Really, no check issued to me for money not used. Some just keep money I worked for. Sounds like a scam in the end. Wow, I think I need a lawyer.







OMG, these "people" are worthless.  Truly worthless.  They seem to know how to cash checks (they've cashed 3 of ours), but are unable to notify our insurance company that we are COBRA covered.  We've been on 3-way calls with them and Anthem to confirm our coverage, but Wageworks is incapable of following through.  Unbelievable.  They've wasted hours of our time.  I hate this company.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Just the absolute worst customer service ever. Their commuter card simply doesn't work -- even at Caltrain, and when you call the 1800-***-off is as apparent as ever. Impossible to get through to an agent. Once you do, it's a circus act trying to get reimbursed for anything -- they want you to print and mail forms and go through as much BS as possible so that they don't actually have to pay.







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







WageWorks should be ashamed of their company management and customer service. I have never encountered such high levels of dishonesty and utter incompetence. My company uses their Employee-Funded Transit Benefits service. I work in San Francisco, so I (and most of my coworkers) rely heavily on public transit for our daily commutes. This means we allocate substantial amounts of our paychecks into our Wageworks accounts. Last week, all of our account balances were suddenly $0.00. Many of us lost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars so we were quite concerned. I called their customer service line 3 times. The first time, I was on hold for 15 minutes, and the woman told me I would be transfered and then proceeded to hang up on me. The second time, the woman I spoke to could hardly read her scripted replies, was extremely rude and condescending, and then hung up. The third time, the man I spoke to told me that the issue was on my company's side and that the money had already been returned to my employer, which turned out to be a complete lie. Upon contacting my corporate benefits manager, he informed me that the issue was company-wide and they had been struggling with WageWorks for over a week. They had even lied to him and said the issue had already been resolved, when clearly it had not. Apparently our company is just one of WageWorks' many clients whose money has still not been returned. 

To make matters worse, I emailed WageWorks explaining what happened with their customer service line and asking to be contacted directly to solve the issue. I received a reply one week later with a generic response requesting me to call their customer service hotline... no thanks, I'm not interested in wasting even more of my time. 

It shocks me that this company manages to stay in business. I guess all of the money they steal from hard-working people keeps them afloat. I will be advising our corporate benefits manager to seek out an honest transit benefits provider for us to use in the future. WageWorks is a scam.







Just like the other 240 plus people here, I got a rude awakening when I called wageworks to inquire why I can't use their card for my monthly parking pass at Caltrain.  The phone was handled by a Flipino with horrible accent and I had to have her repeat everything couple of times, she was totally lost too on the process and 45 minutes later I looked up the information during the hold times and guided her to set me up with "Reimburse me" option.  God help these short sighted CEO's and my low IQ countrymen who allow these atrocities to happen by outsourcing jobs outside of the country and cutting corners on services.







Thee absolute worst FSA company I have ever had. Customer Service is useless and don't know NOTHING. It takes 12 weeks to get reimbursed for a claim after it is approved. Then you never receive the check and they just keep telling you it is in the mail. They have prerecorded scripts that they say to everyone. It takes 10 business and then the next one it takes 10 business days from another date other than the check issue date. Then they tell you after the 20 business days that it takes another 10 days for them to research. 43 days later still no check for reimbursement. THE WORST and COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

OMG, these "people" are worthless.  Truly worthless.  They seem to know how to cash checks (they've cashed 3 of ours), but are unable to notify our insurance company that we are COBRA covered.  We've been on 3-way calls with them and Anthem to confirm our coverage, but Wageworks is incapable of following through.  Unbelievable.  They've wasted hours of our time.  I hate this company.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Just the absolute worst customer service ever. Their commuter card simply doesn't work -- even at Caltrain, and when you call the 1800-***-off is as apparent as ever. Impossible to get through to an agent. Once you do, it's a circus act trying to get reimbursed for anything -- they want you to print and mail forms and go through as much BS as possible so that they don't actually have to pay.

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

WageWorks should be ashamed of their company management and customer service. I have never encountered such high levels of dishonesty and utter incompetence. My company uses their Employee-Funded Transit Benefits service. I work in San Francisco, so I (and most of my coworkers) rely heavily on public transit for our daily commutes. This means we allocate substantial amounts of our paychecks into our Wageworks accounts. Last week, all of our account balances were suddenly $0.00. Many of us lost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars so we were quite concerned. I called their customer service line 3 times. The first time, I was on hold for 15 minutes, and the woman told me I would be transfered and then proceeded to hang up on me. The second time, the woman I spoke to could hardly read her scripted replies, was extremely rude and condescending, and then hung up. The third time, the man I spoke to told me that the issue was on my company's side and that the money had already been returned to my employer, which turned out to be a complete lie. Upon contacting my corporate benefits manager, he informed me that the issue was company-wide and they had been struggling with WageWorks for over a week. They had even lied to him and said the issue had already been resolved, when clearly it had not. Apparently our company is just one of WageWorks' many clients whose money has still not been returned. To make matters worse, I emailed WageWorks explaining what happened with their customer service line and asking to be contacted directly to solve the issue. I received a reply one week later with a generic response requesting me to call their customer service hotline... no thanks, I'm not interested in wasting even more of my time. It shocks me that this company manages to stay in business. I guess all of the money they steal from hard-working people keeps them afloat. I will be advising our corporate benefits manager to seek out an honest transit benefits provider for us to use in the future. WageWorks is a scam.

Just like the other 240 plus people here, I got a rude awakening when I called wageworks to inquire why I can't use their card for my monthly parking pass at Caltrain.  The phone was handled by a Flipino with horrible accent and I had to have her repeat everything couple of times, she was totally lost too on the process and 45 minutes later I looked up the information during the hold times and guided her to set me up with "Reimburse me" option.  God help these short sighted CEO's and my low IQ countrymen who allow these atrocities to happen by outsourcing jobs outside of the country and cutting corners on services.

Thee absolute worst FSA company I have ever had. Customer Service is useless and don't know NOTHING. It takes 12 weeks to get reimbursed for a claim after it is approved. Then you never receive the check and they just keep telling you it is in the mail. They have prerecorded scripts that they say to everyone. It takes 10 business and then the next one it takes 10 business days from another date other than the check issue date. Then they tell you after the 20 business days that it takes another 10 days for them to research. 43 days later still no check for reimbursement. THE WORST and COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.

It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.

My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.

My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.

It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.







I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.

In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.

I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.

What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. 

To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.







Dr prescription for over-the-counter drugs/medicine? Cough medicine?  JOKE
App is confusing, "Paymeback" is actually under Healthcare Claim= confusing

Customer service: overall nice, BUT automated talk/dialogue, heavy accents at times (cheaper, H1B's?). 

I only am staying w/ this because I have to (employer uses them.) Other than that...stay away







Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful







AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
So hard to work with, endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand. They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.







This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.







Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!







As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.

The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.







I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.

1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.

2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.

3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.







Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.







Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.







Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.







Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...

WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.

Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. 

If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...







I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.







Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. 

In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!







Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.







I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.







Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?

Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  

I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. 

The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.







My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. 

Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.

This is a two, mainly because I quite like my automatic caltrain pass that's taken out of my paycheck.It's nice the money is taken out pre-tax, but honestly the convience of not having to visit Walgreens (becaue you can't buy a pass from the stations any longer) and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent I save.My biggest issue is the commuter benefits card (CBC) that I used with Uber. Right away people at work noticed something different about their Ubers. The Ubers with the CBC card were older models, usually vans. Once I got my card, I also immediately noticed a difference in service as well. The people were usually (not all but 80%) very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin, sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all.My final straw came when for a week when I would order a CBC Uber and the eta would be 18, 19, 23 minutes, over and over again - yet when I ordered it to my personal credit card, 2 minutes away.It's not worth what small percentage I save pre-tax if I have to wait 20 min to get a older poorly driver Uber to get to work. I canceled the CBC.

I work for a university in the northeastern region. My university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this January. At that time I had around $220 pre-tax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this. I was mailed a credit card first and was told that I can use it to charge my Charlie Card (I am in Boston). But I was never able to use their creditcard. So I called Wage Works and that when the nightmare started.In April 2017, I called them and inquired how I can get my $220 back. A man on the customer service team said that he could not load the $220 onto their own credit card but could load 84.5 onto a Charlie card for June. I must wait till June 1 to use it and the money will not expire. Then I got the card, since I still have a couple of other Charlies Cards, I did not start using it until yesterday, June 29, when I was told that the Charlie card will expire tomorrow, on June 30. I spoke with the Charlie Card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass, not a Charlie card loaded with credits at all.I called them again this morning. They did not seem to know anything they are talking about. After asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor, I was told that the guy in April gave me the wrong information. That the 84.5 was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month. NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THE EXPIRATION AT ALL.What's worse, they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card. But there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining 84.5 minus my ride yesterday. In addition, the July order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for July and unable to put it onto my credit card. To sum up, because of their lies, I spent $84.5 taking a freaking subway ride of 3 stops in June. They lied about the creditcard's ability to carry on credit; they lied about the monthly pass's expiration date; and they refused to make it right. I am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism. They should be fired.

Customer service representatives seem like they don't know much about the company or its policies, so if you wanna do your election and it'll be with them, u better make sure u won't mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that, you're just gonna get stressed out even more for they don't give accurate information, unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already. They need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful

They try really hard to not talk to you. ie, i called and they told them someone from HR can only talk to them about my commuter benefits. HR calls, and told me they can only talk to me. MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND! Waste of time and they lost all the money I contributed to my commuter benefits.

This is one of the very worst vendors I have ever worked with in all my years in the corporate/work world. They have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide. It is well-deserved. WageWorks has a faulty system, and their customer service reps do not speak the truth. They don't lie on purpose, it's just that they are woefully ill-informed. The WW system confirms an order, then cancels it the following day. Before it was canceled, I confirmed with TWO separate reps that I was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits. When you call to get confirmation from a customer rep, then from a "supervisor", they say they cannot help you. When you ask to speak to the supe's manager, you cannot. Why? "They don't take calls." It is a broken system filled with red-tape flaws and contradictory errors. I hate WageWorks.

Poorly trained buffoons!  I've been trying to get them to roll over my HSA balance for half a year.  Every time I speak to them they tell me I need to speak to the bank, who then tells me I need to speak to Wageworks.  The bank transfers me to Wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time.  I mail the form in then nothing happens.  Arrrgghhhhh!  Meanwhile I'm being charged monthly fees, which I assume is why they're so reluctant to roll my balance over.  Stay away from these idiots!

As you can't really email support on line, I guess Yelp is the next best option.  I had an FSA account that I was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it.  I never submitted every month for these payments but they came in.The customer support person didn't speak English very well and couldn't get her head around my issue.  The online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something.  For the love of god please update your customer support to include email.Thomas

Worst customer service of any company I've worked with, except possibly Comcast. I had a smart-card type transit pass that was issued by WageWorks via payroll deduction. It fell out of my pocket and I needed to get a replacement. When you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money, the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a $5 fee. But I couldn't walk into the transit customer service office and pay the $5 fee myself because the card was registered to WageWorks. And not only would WageWorks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media, they told me it was too late to prevent my NEXT month's $90 pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the 15th of the month. I've had far better customer service from the IRS.

I have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory, despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be.1. Technology is less than par - the online user interface appears very simple, and maybe idiotproof, at first, but you soon realize it is too simplistic, confusing, and clunky.  I had trouble advancing to the next screen when I tried to stop my commuter card deductions, only to have to call their help line.  And even here, I had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computer-generated voice let me through.2. There is no email option or chat box - I have a feeling like other reviewers here, most people's times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer.  I don't understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time.3. Customer service quality - is very minimal and not very friendly to users.  Everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers.  Not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching.

Not ready for prime time. Often fails. For example, login for new device asks where I want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice - hence unable to move past step 2 to access my account. Many similar fails.

Wage Works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums. They are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements & jeopardize employees' continuation of benefits. The level of customer service they provide is subpar.

Perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care FSAs, and my commuter benefit. Claims can be filed online, and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit. For Transit, I have a debit card linked up to my Clipper Card and it always works well.

Update: Since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better, so I am upgrading them to 3 stars...WAGEWORKS you SUCK !! Your Cobra Department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate. Your So called lead Aaron @ Side103 was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasn't even his real name.Your system is outdated and won't auto take payments out, you won't contact health providers to instate Cobra Ins when a problem occurs. I was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasn't contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the EMAIL again, a few days later again and a few days later again. The Health Provider states we never got it, so instead of wasting my time you would think Wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up.. NOPE, or wait if email is not working then FAX them, oh no we can't do that, so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email that's not working. If you run a company stay away from this place people HATE it read the reviews and I haven even gotten to the commuter cards...  This is what Epic company failures are ...

I have an account with Wageworks. I could not login and called customer service. They are a bunch of idiots. They can see my account but could not help me. WHY NOT? I think they have a call center somewhere overseas. Horrible company. I am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card. Oh and they asked me not to contact HR. Kinda shady. This is the absolute worse company I have ever encountered. If your an HR manager, please stay away from these amateurs. I wonder if the Wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp, maybe they just don't care.

Customer service is very poor. Language barriers, lack of documentation about previous contacts, and overall incompetence equates to WageWorks. Rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them, I decided to forego reimbursement. They will wear you down - I'm starting to feel less stress already now that I have decided to cut my losses. In theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation WageWorks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold!

Nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas. Their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who don't speak English well, reading from scripts. If you don't have a common issue, they won't be able to help. They don't understand what you are saying, because it isn't in the script So sad. SHAME ON YOU Wageworks.

I'm writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service.  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family. I have consistently paid my premiums on time.  They claim I underpaid the premiums.  I never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage. When I initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within 3-5 business days and that I didn't have to be concerned about termination of coverage. Follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage, and that I was in good standing. Suddenly I get an email saying that my coverage is terminated.    WageWorks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications. They gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that I received no notifications until it was too late.  The only remedy they've offered is to file an appeal which will take 30 days with no guarantee of reinstatement.  Now I'm left with zero health care coverage, and I'm left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market.  I will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  WageWorks, and recommend they do not use them as a vendor. I also plan to yelp and tweet about this.

Their customer service is horrendous.  My company switched to WageWorks for transportation benefits in June, with the first monthly train ticket coming from WageWorks for July.  First of all, I had major issues setting up my account. When I put in my info to set up the account, it kept taking me to an account I'd had with WageWorks 12 -- yes, 12 -- years earlier at another employer.  That employer no longer even uses WageWorks.  It took multiple frustrating calls to WageWorks to get that resolved.  Essentially, I ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name.  What kind of company can't close the old account after 12 years or merge the two accounts so that I could use the preferred version of my name?Then, I gave notice in mid June that I would be leaving my employer.  Unfortunately, it was after processing my no longer needed July ticket had started.  I tried to contact WageWorks to stop and, once again, ran into the fact I have two WageWorks accounts.  It was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor.  My HR department couldn't resolve the issue, so I was told by HR to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back.  I mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance.  Weeks later, I got a response from WageWorks that they couldn't accept the letter and I had to use their refund request form.  I then submitted the refund request form, and my request was denied on the grounds that I had had the use of the July ticket for the month of July.  For the month of July, my ticket was sitting on someone's desk at WageWorks. The 800 number is next to worthless.  I've finally given up on getting the ticket refunded.  I dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses WageWorks because I'll probably end up with three accounts.

My employer uses WageWorks for commuter benefits and FSA benefits for employees. I am leaving my job to move to a new city in August, so I canceled my commuter benefits in June. I called WageWorks' customer service team twice on the day that I canceled my benefits in order to confirm that I wouldn't have a paycheck deduction in July (for use in August). Two independent customer service representatives assured me that I would have no deduction for my July paycheck. This morning, I noticed that there was a deduction on my July paycheck from WageWorks. I called their customer service department again and explained that I had been informed that I would have no deduction for July and that I would like a refund. They had a record that I had been informed that I would not have a deduction, but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund. When I escalated the issue, they informed me that it would take 7-10 business days to even contact me about the escalation, let alone to resolve the issue. Obviously, because most of us have our services from WageWorks offered through our employers, it is impossible for us to discontinue using them. I believe that WageWorks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services. I am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue, and WageWorks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called. I hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers, but it's hard for me to draw any other conclusion. Hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using WageWorks. For people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations, it is devastating to have an unexpected, uncontrolled, and irreversible charge. It is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative, misinformed, and unhelpful customer service personnel.
