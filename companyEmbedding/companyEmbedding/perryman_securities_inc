 Perryman Financial Advisory, Inc.
is a Dallas-based financial planning and investment firm serving a select number of individuals, families, and businesses. Our mission is to serve as a trusted advisor for our clients as they accumulate, preserve, and transfer their wealth.   
Who We Are
It’s effortless for a company to make claims about the level of service they provide their clients. It is much more difficult to provide the level of service that clients tell others about.  That’s how we have built Perryman Financial Advisory since 1983; almost exclusively through satisfied referrals. Our clients’ satisfaction is our measure for success. It’s also the only way we get new business.



CFP Difference
Wouldn’t it be great if you had someone you trusted to take care of your finances for you? You’d certainly have one less thing to worry about. You’d have time to enjoy the more important aspects of your life – time to play with your kids, travel, and do the things you just plain enjoy – golf, gardening, you name it. You’d be secure knowing that someone with your best interests at heart is watching over this crucial area of your life.

Wouldn’t it be great if you had someone you trusted to take care of your finances for you? You’d certainly have one less thing to worry about.

 Patti, Ryan, Bill, Jimmy, Deb, Jan, Cinda
Trusted Financial Advisors in Dallas, TX

Bill Perryman, CPA, CFP®
Spend a few minutes with Bill and you are apt to find out that he is proud of his Oklahoma heritage. Growing up on a farm gave him a strong work ethic, a core value system, and, ultimately, a profound entrepreneurial spirit. As a CPA, Bill’s professional career began with a major oil company in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and later started a financial services firm which evolved into what is now Perryman Financial Advisory.
Bill moved to Dallas in 1988 and immediately involved himself in attempting to “make a difference” in his church, profession and community. His team at PFA endeavors to create a family atmosphere where each client is unique and receives customized advice to be able to navigate today’s economic uncertainties resulting in a secure financial future.
Demonstrating his commitment to advancing the financial planning industry, Bill served as President of the Dallas-Fort Worth Chapter of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners and served on its Board of Directors for six years. In recognition for his significant contributions and dedication to the profession, Bill was honored with the prestigious 2008 Honor’s Award from the Financial Planning Association, Dallas-Fort Worth Chapter. He has repeatedly been named by area financial professionals as one of “The Best Financial Planners in Dallas” by D Magazine and more recently was named one of the most powerful business leaders in D CEO Magazine’s Dallas 500 (2016).
At the heart of his “making a difference” philosophy, is his commitment to the community through the East Dallas Rotary Club. Rotary’s motto, “He who serves most profits the most,” echoes Bill’s beliefs. Bill has served his club in leadership roles both locally and at the district level for over 29 years.
Bill is married to Barbara and they share six adult children and six beautiful grandchildren.

Bill can be reached at bperryman@billperryman.com.
 

Jimmy Perryman, CFP® 


PFA Shareholder
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™
Served in the industry since 2001
Specializes in portfolio management and comprehensive planning
Voted one of “the best financial planners in Dallas” by D Magazine (2004-2016)
Served on the Board of Directors of the DFW Financial Planning Association
Published in The Dallas Morning News and MONEY® Magazine


After spending six years in commercial real estate, Jimmy joined PFA in 2001 and quickly realized there is nothing more rewarding than to help clients realize their dreams and to feel more confident about their future. He considers being a Certified Financial Planner™ much more than designing portfolios or making investment recommendations. It’s building a relationship with each client, helping to bring order to their financial life, creating a strategy that empowers them to pursue their goals, and helping them to avoid emotionally driven decisions in important money matters.
Jimmy has a solid reputation in the industry. He was selected by D Magazine as one of the “Best Financial Planners in Dallas” from 2004-2016. He has also been published in The Dallas Morning News and MONEY® Magazine and has served on the Board of Directors of the DFW Financial Planning Association.
Outside of the office some of Jimmy’s most rewarding investments have been in his community, church, and family. He is Past President of the Addison Rotary club and currently serves on the board of the Ronald McDonald House of Dallas. He keeps his competitive fire alive by coaching youth sports and rooting for the Astros and Sooners. Jimmy graduated from Abilene Christian University where he met his wife, Alisa. They have two children and live in Dallas.

Jimmy can be reached at jperryman@billperryman.com.
 

Deb Outlaw, CPA, CFP®


PFA Shareholder
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™
CPA
Certified in Long -Term Care by the CLTC Board of Standards, Inc.
MBA from University of Texas
Served in the industry since 1981
Specializes in eldercare and long term care planning


Deb realized early on in her career that she has a passion and gift for working one-on-one with people to deeply understand and formulate solutions to their financial concerns. She began her career as a CPA with Arthur Andersen in 1981, and moved to Trammell Crow Company in 1986 where she worked with several of their partners to plan and implement tax, financial and estate plans. She continued developing her skills in tax and financial planning with Farmer, Fuqua, Hunt and Munselle, a full service accounting firm. Perryman Financial Advisory convinced her to come aboard in 2000, and she has been serving her clients ever since.
Many of Deb’s clients have come to her suddenly single or overwhelmed with managing financial decisions they never planned on making. Deb is very befitting to these situations, as she finds fulfillment in playing a role in the healing process coming out of a crisis. Her clients know her as an intent listener that takes a sincere interest in them. This allows her to bring focused direction and clarity to their tailored financial plans. She has lived through the emotional, physical and financial anguish of caring for an incapacitated loved one and she helps her clients avoid this by planning ahead for one of the most expensive times in their life. Deb advises her clients and forms holistic plans including insurance, benefit evaluation, Medicare, assisted living and healthcare planning. This passion for eldercare is what led Deb to seek her CLTC (Certified in Long- Term Care) designation.
Deb is easy to talk to and breaks down complicated issues in order to equip her clients with the best guidance for their situation. She takes pride in the longstanding relationships she has with most of her clients and many of them call her friend.
Deb lives in Plano with husband Mike, one cat, Minka, and her beloved Bichon, Isaac. She is a Children’s Area Coordinator for Bible Study Fellowship and is also on the board of New Friends New Life, a ministry dedicated to helping women and children out of degrading situations. In her spare time, Deb enjoys quilting and scrapbooking.

Deb can be reached at doutlaw@billperryman.com.
 

Patti Sanders
After graduating from Oklahoma State University with a Bachelor of Science degree, Patti Sanders worked in the food and banking industries before settling in Dallas. Until 1999, she worked for a mid-sized oil and gas company as their accounts payable manager. Fortunately for Perryman Financial Advisory, Inc., when her company relocated to Houston, Patti chose to remain in Dallas. Patti maintains our database, handles all Schwab and TD Ameritrade accounts, makes trades for our clients, and is the backbone of our office staff.
Patti and husband, Stan, live in the Rockwall area where they enjoy a quite peaceful country life. The Sanders have two children and five grandchildren. They enjoy collecting antique cars and attending local car shows.
Patti can be reached at psanders@billperryman.com.
 

Cinda Kraft
Cinda is our Client Appreciation Coordinator, and the mastermind behind all of our client events. Cinda was first a Perryman Financial Advisory Inc. client before she joined the team. She now splits her time between Perryman Financial Advisory, Inc. and her love for sewing and quilting. She even teaches a few sewing classes. Cinda and her husband, Robert, have two daughters and three grandchildren.
Cinda can be reached at ckraft@billperryman.com.
 

Jan Mayfield
Jan is one of the newest members to join the Perryman Financial Advisory, Inc. team. She comes to us with years of experience as an Executive Assistant and Community Relations Specialist in the Technology Industry of a Fortune 500 company, and most recently from Texas Oncology as a Patient Financial Counselor. Jan’s helpful voice will be the first one our clients hear when they call the office. She will be able to assist you in a myriad of things or direct you to the appropriate person. Jan is excited to get to know our clients and be able to put a face with a name.
Jan lives in McKinney with her daughter Lauren who is currently attending the University of North Texas and her adorable Shih Tzu Chloe. She and her daughter attend Prestonwood Baptist Church and in Jan’s spare time she enjoys interior decorating in addition to spending time with family and friends.
Jan can be reached at jmayfield@billperryman.com.

Who We Are
Financial & Wealth Management Firm in Dallas
It’s effortless for a company to make claims about the level of service they provide their clients. It is much more difficult to provide the level of service that clients tell others about. That’s how we have built Perryman Financial Advisory since 1983; almost exclusively through satisfied referrals. At our financial advisory and wealth management firm in Dallas, TX, our clients’ satisfaction is our measure for success. It’s also the primary way we get new business.
Should you choose to work with Perryman Financial Advisory, you will quickly realize that you are a priority; our low client-to-advisor ratio means we are always available and focused on you.  We have a fiduciary relationship with our clients, so that their interest is our only interest. As a client, you will discover that we have a long-term perspective on your investments and our relationship with you. Perryman Financial has had success in over 30 years worth of different financial climates and challenges. We approach every relationship with a goal of eventually earning your grandchildren’s business. This personalized service allows us to optimize your performance through customized portfolios for every client, the flexibility to offer a broad range of investments and solutions and a collaborative team of advisors with complementary specialties. Wealth can come with a lot of burdens that keep you from enjoying life and spending time on your passions.
Perryman Financial simplifies the burden of wealth management with all-inclusive fees and a comprehensive approach to stewardship.  We are easy and enjoyable to work with. We have been in business since 1983 because we have a very low client turnover rate; in fact we have several multi-generational clients.  Our character and integrity are at the forefront of everything we do.  From the advice we give, to always doing what is advantageous to our clients (often at a cost), to our investment in the community. We build wealth, but we are passionate about building people and communities.  That is why our team is involved in organizations such as Rotary International, New Friends New Life, Rise School of Dallas and Bible Study Fellowship. We are a family company, and not only because a handful of Perrymans work here. We consider our clients an extension of our family and take very seriously the responsibility of that relationship.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Suncoast Credit Union


                                            Once again Suncoast has shown itself to be a preschooler in the land of credit unions.

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Trusted Financial Advisors in Dallas, TX

Bill Perryman, CPA, CFP®
Spend a few minutes with Bill and you are apt to find out that he is proud of his Oklahoma heritage. Growing up on a farm gave him a strong work ethic, a core value system, and, ultimately, a profound entrepreneurial spirit. As a CPA, Bill’s professional career began with a major oil company in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and later started a financial services firm which evolved into what is now Perryman Financial Advisory.
Bill moved to Dallas in 1988 and immediately involved himself in attempting to “make a difference” in his church, profession and community. His team at PFA endeavors to create a family atmosphere where each client is unique and receives customized advice to be able to navigate today’s economic uncertainties resulting in a secure financial future.

Jimmy Perryman, CFP® 


PFA Shareholder
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™
Served in the industry since 2001
Specializes in portfolio management and comprehensive planning
Voted one of “the best financial planners in Dallas” by D Magazine (2004-2016)
Served on the Board of Directors of the DFW Financial Planning Association
Published in The Dallas Morning News and MONEY® Magazine


After spending six years in commercial real estate, Jimmy joined PFA in 2001 and quickly realized there is nothing more rewarding than to help clients realize their dreams and to feel more confident about their future. He considers being a Certified Financial Planner™ much more than designing portfolios or making investment recommendations. It’s building a relationship with each client, helping to bring order to their financial life, creating a strategy that empowers them to pursue their goals, and helping them to avoid emotionally driven decisions in important money matters.
Jimmy has a solid reputation in the industry. He was selected by D Magazine as one of the “Best Financial Planners in Dallas” from 2004-2016. He has also been published in The Dallas Morning News and MONEY® Magazine and has served on the Board of Directors of the DFW Financial Planning Association.
Outside of the office some of Jimmy’s most rewarding investments have been in his community, church, and family. He is Past President of the Addison Rotary club and currently serves on the board of the Ronald McDonald House of Dallas. He keeps his competitive fire alive by coaching youth sports and rooting for the Astros and Sooners. Jimmy graduated from Abilene Christian University where he met his wife, Alisa. They have two children and live in Dallas.

Deb Outlaw, CPA, CFP®


PFA Shareholder
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™
CPA
Certified in Long -Term Care by the CLTC Board of Standards, Inc.
MBA from University of Texas
Served in the industry since 1981
Specializes in eldercare and long term care planning


Deb realized early on in her career that she has a passion and gift for working one-on-one with people to deeply understand and formulate solutions to their financial concerns. She began her career as a CPA with Arthur Andersen in 1981, and moved to Trammell Crow Company in 1986 where she worked with several of their partners to plan and implement tax, financial and estate plans. She continued developing her skills in tax and financial planning with Farmer, Fuqua, Hunt and Munselle, a full service accounting firm. Perryman Financial Advisory convinced her to come aboard in 2000, and she has been serving her clients ever since.
Many of Deb’s clients have come to her suddenly single or overwhelmed with managing financial decisions they never planned on making. Deb is very befitting to these situations, as she finds fulfillment in playing a role in the healing process coming out of a crisis. Her clients know her as an intent listener that takes a sincere interest in them. This allows her to bring focused direction and clarity to their tailored financial plans. She has lived through the emotional, physical and financial anguish of caring for an incapacitated loved one and she helps her clients avoid this by planning ahead for one of the most expensive times in their life. Deb advises her clients and forms holistic plans including insurance, benefit evaluation, Medicare, assisted living and healthcare planning. This passion for eldercare is what led Deb to seek her CLTC (Certified in Long- Term Care) designation.
Deb is easy to talk to and breaks down complicated issues in order to equip her clients with the best guidance for their situation. She takes pride in the longstanding relationships she has with most of her clients and many of them call her friend.
Deb lives in Plano with husband Mike, one cat, Minka, and her beloved Bichon, Isaac. She is a Children’s Area Coordinator for Bible Study Fellowship and is also on the board of New Friends New Life, a ministry dedicated to helping women and children out of degrading situations. In her spare time, Deb enjoys quilting and scrapbooking.

 Perryman Financial Advisory, Inc.
is a Dallas-based financial planning and investment firm serving a select number of individuals, families, and businesses. Our mission is to serve as a trusted advisor for our clients as they accumulate, preserve, and transfer their wealth.   
Who We Are
It’s effortless for a company to make claims about the level of service they provide their clients. It is much more difficult to provide the level of service that clients tell others about.  That’s how we have built Perryman Financial Advisory since 1983; almost exclusively through satisfied referrals. Our clients’ satisfaction is our measure for success. It’s also the only way we get new business.



CFP Difference
Wouldn’t it be great if you had someone you trusted to take care of your finances for you? You’d certainly have one less thing to worry about. You’d have time to enjoy the more important aspects of your life – time to play with your kids, travel, and do the things you just plain enjoy – golf, gardening, you name it. You’d be secure knowing that someone with your best interests at heart is watching over this crucial area of your life.
