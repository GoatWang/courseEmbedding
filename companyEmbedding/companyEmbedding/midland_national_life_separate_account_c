				Many people instantly think of covering final expenses as a reason for purchasing life insurance. It is true that life insurance can provide death benefit protection that passes to beneficiaries generally income tax free, but it can do so much more.

Why Annuities

Annuities are an excellent tool to help you plan for your financial future.
Features:
 

• Guaranteed lifetime income
 

• Tax-deferred growth1
 

• Withdrawal options when you need it2
 

• Death benefit to help create a legacy that may avoid probate
 
The chart is a hypothetical example of tax-deferral and assumes an initial premium of $100,000, 4.00% compounded annual rate of return, 33% tax rate, and held for 15 years. The tax-deferred value less taxes represents the increase in value, due to tax-deferral, less taxes with no surrender charge or Market Value Adjustment (also known as Interest Adjustment) applied. This example is not intended to predict or project performance.
 

 
 
1. Under current law, annuities grow tax deferred. An annuity is not required for tax deferral in qualified plans. Annuities may be subject to taxation during the income or withdrawal phase. Neither Midland National® Life Insurance Company, nor any agents acting on its behalf, should be viewed as providing legal, tax or investment advice. Your client should be advised to rely on their own qualified adviser. 2. Withdrawals taken prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to IRS penalties.

	Types of Life Insurance


Term Life Insurance:
	Term life insurance policies provide affordable, temporary coverage. Term policies contain no cash value and are designed for death benefit protection only. The premiums may be level for the first 10, 15, 20 or 30 years, depending on the policy selected. Because the death benefit protection is for a limited period, the premium is often the lowest of all types of life insurance policies. However, after the level term period, premiums go up significantly and increase annually.

Whole Life Insurance:
	Whole life is the traditional form of permanent life insurance. It provides the certainty of level premiums, a guaranteed interest rate and a guaranteed death benefit1. Whole Life provides the extra security of guaranteed protection at affordable rates, yet it includes the element of cash value accumulation.

Universal Life Insurance:
	Universal life is a flexible premium, adjustable life insurance product that provides you with the flexibility of choosing the policy features that are appropriate for you and adjusting those features as your financial priorities and needs change. Policy cash value that grows on a tax-deferred basis2.

Indexed Universal Life:
	Indexed universal life is a version of universal life that combines death benefit protection with the opportunity to grow cash value through an account that credits interest based upon the upward movement of stock market indexes – without the risk of investing directly in the market. The Index Account features a zero percent floor which guarantees your account won't earn less than zero percent due to poor market performance.

Variable Universal Life:
	Variable universal life insurance is designed to provide solid death benefit protection and the potential for cash accumulation. The combination of flexibility, attractive tax features, and Separate Account investment portfolios create life insurance products that you can tailor to your insurance needs, risk orientation and long-term objectives.

	 

Please consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.  The product prospectus and the fund prospectuses contain this and other information about the funds and Midland National's variable products and the funds.  To obtain current product and fund prospectuses, you can call or write to Midland National Life Insurance Company, Administrative Office, One Sammons Plaza, Sioux Falls, SD, 57193-0001, (605) 335-5700.  Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send any money.

	 



1.Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of Midland National.

2.Midland National does not give tax or legal advice. You should consult a professional prior to making a purchasing decision.

 Life insurance policies have terms under which the policy may be continued in force or discontinued. Current risk rates and interest rates are not guaranteed. Therefore, the planned periodic premium may not be sufficient to carry the contract to maturity. For Indexed Universal Life policies, the Index Accounts are subject to caps and participation rates and in no case will the interest credited be less than 0 percent. The policy's death benefit is paid upon the death of the insured. The policy does not continue to accumulate cash value and excess interest after the insured's death. Please refer to the customized illustration provided by your agent for additional detail. For costs and complete details, call or write Midland National Life Insurance Company, Administrative Office, One Sammons Plaza Sioux Falls, SD 57193. Telephone: (605) 335-5700.

Variable products distributed by Sammons Financial Network® LLC, member FINRA. Sammons Financial Network® LLC and Midland National® Life Insurance Company are affiliated companies and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Sammons Enterprises, Inc. of Dallas, Texas.

Indexed Universal Life products are not an investment in the "market" or in the applicable index and are subject to all policy fees and charges normally associated with most universal life insurance.

 Vector II Variable Annuity Prospectus

March 31, 2006

Flexible Premium Deferred Variable Annuity
issued by: Midland National Life Insurance Company
through the Midland National Life Separate Account C
 Phone: (877) 586-0240 (toll free) Fax: (866) 270-9565 (toll-free)

Please read this prospectus for details on the contract being offered to You and
keep it for future reference. This prospectus sets forth the information that a 
prospective investor should know before investing.                              

The Vector II Variable Annuity (the "contract") is a flexible premium deferred  
annuity designed to be useful to You in meeting Your long-term savings and      
retirement needs. The minimum initial premium for a non-qualified contract is   
$10,000. The minimum initial premium for a qualified contract is $2,000.        

If You elect the Extra Credit Rider, We will add the premium bonus to each      
premium payment that You make in the first contract year. Electing the Extra    
Credit Rider may be beneficial to You only if You own the contract for a        
sufficient length of time, and the investment performance of the underlying     
portfolios is sufficient to compensate for the additional fee charged for the   
Extra Credit Rider. Your expenses will be higher if You elect the Extra Credit  
Rider and over time, the value of the premium bonus may be more than offset by  
the extra fee charged for the Extra Credit Rider.

National Life Separate Account C is available free of charge by checking the

Accumulation Unit means the units credited to each investment division in the   
Separate Account before the maturity date.                                      

Accumulation Value means the sum of the amounts You have in the investment      
divisions of Our Separate Account under Your inforce contract.                  

Annuitant means the person(s), designated by the owner, to whom periodic income 
will be paid (Payee). This is the person whose life is used to determine the    
amount and duration of any periodic income involving life contingencies. After  
the maturity date, the annuitant will be considered the owner unless otherwise  
stated.                                                                         

Annuity Unit means the units in the Separate Account, after the maturity date,  
that are used to determine the amount of the annuity payment.                   

Annuitization means an election of an annuity payment option on the maturity    
date.                                                                           

Annuitize means an election to receive regular income payments from Your        
contract under one of the annuity payment options. An election to annuitize Your
contract may be irrevocable. If You elect to annuitize Your contract, You will  
no longer be able to exercise any liquidity (e.g., full or partial surrenders)  
provision that may have previously been available.                              

Attained Age means the issue age plus the number of complete contract years     
since the issue date.                                                           

Beneficiary means the person or persons to whom the contract's death benefit    
will be paid in the event of the death of the annuitant or an owner.            

Business Day means any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for regular      
trading. Our business day ends when the New York Stock Exchange closes for      
regular trading (generally 3:00 p.m. Central Time).                             

Contract Anniversary means the same date in each contract year as the issue     
date.                                                                           

Contract Month means each month that begins on the same date as the day of the  
issue date. For this purpose, the calendar days of 29, 30 and 31 are not used   
and We look forward to the first day of the next calendar month. For example,   
assume a contract is issued on January 29th. Subsequent contract months will    
begin on the first of each month (February 1, March 1, April 1, etc.).          

Contract Year means a year that starts on the issue date or on each anniversary 
thereafter.                                                                     

Death Benefit means the amount that We will pay to the beneficiary in the event 
of the death of the annuitant or an owner if the contract is still inforce. The 
death benefit will be paid when We receive due proof of the death of the        
annuitant or an owner and an election of how the death benefit is to be paid,   
and any other required documents or forms.                                      

Executive Office means Our office located at One Midland Plaza, Sioux Falls, SD
57193. Please use Our Principal Office address and telephone number for all     
correspondence, transaction requests, payments, and inquiries.                  

Funds mean the investment companies, more commonly called mutual funds,         
available for investment by Our Separate Account on the issue date or as later  
changed by Us.                                                                  

GMIB Accumulated Value is the amount that can be annuitized, after a 10-year    
waiting period, if the GMIB Plus rider is elected. The GMIB accumulated value   
will have the GMIB income factors applied to determine the GMIB income payment. 

GMIB Income Factor means the factor used in determining the GMIB income payment 
under the GMIB Plus rider. The GMIB income factor equals the base contract's    
income payment factors used in the contract form under "Settlement Options" with
an 8-year age set-back. An age set-back means the GMIB income payments will be  
lower than if there were no age set-back. For example, if You are age 65 when   
You annuitize Your contract, We will use the income payment factors shown in    
Your contract for age 57 (age 65 minus 8 years).                                

GMIB Roll-Up Benefit means the initial GMIB accumulated value at the time the   
GMIB Plus rider is issued compounded at a rate of 5% annually until age 80.     

Guaranteed Payment Amount (GPA) means the amount that is guaranteed to be       
available each contract year for withdrawal until the GPA is depleted while the 
Five for Life Plus rider is in effect. If the Five for Life Plus rider is       
elected at contract issue, the GPA equals the initial GPB times 7%. If the      
contract has already been issued, this amount equals the current accumulation   
value of the contract times 7%. The GPA may increase with each subsequent       
premium payment and may be reduced if withdrawals within a contract year exceed 
the GPA.                                                                        

Guaranteed Payment Balance (GPB) means the total amount available for future    
periodic guaranteed withdrawals and is used for the purpose of calculating the  
Five for Life Plus Rider. The GPB cannot be withdrawn in a lump sum. If the Five
for Life Plus Rider is elected at contract issue, the GPB equals the initial    
premium payment including premium bonus, if any. If the contract has already    
been issued, this amount equals the current accumulation value of the contract. 
The GPB is increased equally by any subsequent premium payments and is reduced  
by each withdrawal.                                                             

Investment Division means a division of Our Separate Account, which invests     
exclusively in the shares of a specified portfolio of the funds.                

Issue Age means the age of the annuitant on the last birthday before the issue  
date.                                                                           

Issue Date means the date the contract goes into effect and from which contract 
anniversaries, contract months, and contract years are determined.              

Lifetime Payment Amount (LPA) means the amount that is guaranteed to be         
available each contract year for withdrawal during the life of the covered      
person (oldest owner) while the Five for Life Plus Rider is in effect. The      
initial LPA equals 5% times the GPB as determined on the later of the contract  
issue date or the contract anniversary following the day the covered person     
under this Rider has reached age 65. The GPB on the contract anniversary after  
the covered person has reached age 65 will be the initial GPB at rider election 
less any adjustments for partial surrenders and premiums. The LPA may increase  
with each subsequent premium payment and may be reduced if withdrawals within a 
contract year exceed the LPA.                                                   

Maturity Date means the date, specified in Your contract on which income        
payments will begin. The earliest possible maturity date is the 7th contract    
anniversary at which time You may annuitize Your full accumulation value. The   
maximum maturity date is the contract anniversary immediately following the     
annuitant's 100th birthday.                                                     

Net Premium means Your premium payment(s) minus any partial surrenders and any  
surrender charges.                                                              

Owner means the person(s) or entity that is named in the application or on the  
latest change filed with Us who is entitled to exercise all rights and          
privileges provided in the contract. Owner is referred to as "You" in the       
contract and in this prospectus.                                                

Payee means the person who is entitled to receive annuity payments after        
annuitization. On or after the maturity date, the annuitant will be the payee.  
If the owner or an annuitant dies prior to the maturity date, then the          
beneficiary is the payee.                                                       

Principal Office means where You can contact Us to pay premiums or take other

surrender minus any surrender charge, non-vested premium bonus (if any), premium
tax, administration fees, and annual maintenance fee.

experience of each investment division within the Separate Account. This period 
will vary based on the type of transaction request and the investment divisions 
involved in the transaction. For more detailed information see "Transaction
Cut-Off Times" on page 51.

 SUMMARY

In this prospectus "We," "Our," "Us," "Midland National," and "Company" mean    
Midland National Life Insurance Company. "You" and "Your" mean the owner of the 
contract. We refer to the person who is covered by the contract as the          
"annuitant," because the annuitant and the owner might not be the same.         

This summary provides only a brief overview of the more important features of   
the contract. The detailed information appearing later in this prospectus       
further explains the following summary. This summary must be read along with    
that detailed information. Unless otherwise indicated, the description of the   
contract in this prospectus assumes that the contract is inforce.               

FEATURES OF VECTOR II VARIABLE ANNUITY 

The Vector II Variable Annuity contract provides You with a basic contract to   
which You can add optional riders. If You choose to add any of these riders, a  
corresponding charge will be deducted. The flexible premium deferred variable   
annuity contracts described in this prospectus provide for accumulation of the  
accumulation value and payment of annuity payments on a fixed or variable basis.
The contracts are designed to aid individuals in long-term planning for         
retirement or other long-term purposes.                                         

The contracts are available for situations that do not qualify for the special  
federal tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code (non-qualified 
contract) and for retirement plans which do qualify for those tax advantages    
(qualified contract). This contract does not offer any additional tax benefits  
when purchased under a qualified plan. See "Suitability of the Contracts" on    
page 20 for more detailed information.                                          

This contract is designed for individuals seeking a long-term, tax-deferred     
accumulation of assets, and is generally for retirement or other long-term      
purposes. You should not buy this contract if You are looking for a short-term  
investment and/or cannot risk getting back less money than You put into the     
contract.                                                                       

Your "Free Look" Right                                                          

You can examine the contract and return it to Us for any reason within 30 days  
after You receive it for a refund of the accumulation value less credits added  
by Us (which may be more or less than the premium payments You paid), or if     
required by Your state, the original amount of Your premium payment. Longer free
look periods apply in some states and in certain situations (see "Free Look" on 
page 36 for more details).                                                      

Replacing an existing annuity with the contract may not be of financial benefit 
to You. Your existing annuity may be subject to fees or penalties on surrender, 
and the contract may have new charges.                                          

Your Accumulation value Your accumulation value depends on:                     

o   the amount and frequency of premium payments,                       
o   the selected portfolio's investment experience,                     
o   partial surrenders, and                                             
o   charges and deductions.                                             

You bear the investment risk under the contract. There is no minimum guaranteed 
accumulation value with respect to any amounts allocated to the Separate        
Account. (See "Your Accumulation value" on page 51).                            

Flexible Premium Payments                                                       
You may pay premiums whenever You want and in whatever amount You want, within  
certain limits. We generally require an initial minimum premium of at least     
$10,000. However, if You purchase a qualified contract, We may accept an initial
premium of only $2,000. Additional premium payments must be at least $50.       

You may choose a planned periodic premium. You need not pay premiums according  
to the planned schedule.                                                        

Unless You receive approval from Us, the maximum amount of premium You can pay  
into this contract prior to the maturity date is $5,000,000.                    

We may refuse to accept certain forms of premium payments, if applicable, or    
restrict the amount of certain forms of premium payments. For example,          
Traveler's Checks over a certain dollar amount or multiple lower denomination   
Money Orders may not be accepted. In addition, We may require information as to 
why a particular form of payment was used (for example, third party checks) and 
the source of the funds of such payment in order to determine whether or not We 
will accept it. Use of an unacceptable form of payment may result in Us         
returning Your premium payment and not issuing the contract.                    

Optional Benefits                                                               
The contract offers a number of optional benefits or riders. Each of these      
riders offer a specific benefit that may help You achieve Your long-term        
financial goals. There is generally a charge for each rider. These riders offer 
You an opportunity to tailor the Vector II variable annuity to meet Your        
specific needs. Since some optional riders cannot be terminated once elected,   
You should select Your options carefully. The optional riders available under   
this contract are:

o         Extra Credit Rider                                                    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

o         GMIB (Guaranteed Minimum Income and Accumulation Benefit) Plus Rider  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
o         Estate Planning Rider                                                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

For detailed explanations of these riders, see "optional riders" on page 37. For
more information on the charges for each rider, see FEE TABLE" on page 15.      

You cannot elect any combination of options that would result in extra charges  
of more than 2.00% per year. In addition, some of these riders cannot be elected
in combination with other riders. See "Mutually Exclusive Riders" on page 50.   

Investment Choices                                                              

You may allocate Your accumulation value to the investment divisions of Our     
Separate Account. However, You may not have Your accumulation value allocated to
more than 50 investment divisions at any one time. For a full description of the
portfolios, see the funds' prospectuses, which accompany this prospectus. (See  
"The Funds" on page 23). Your choices may be restricted if You elect the GMIB   
Plus rider or the GMDB Plus rider, and benefits under these riders may be       
severely limited if You choose certain investment divisions.                    

Each portfolio pays a different investment management or advisory fee and       
different operating expenses. The portfolios may also impose redemption fees,   
which We would deduct from Your accumulation value. More detail concerning each 
portfolio company's fees and expenses is contained in the prospectus for each

23.                                                                             

Transfers                                                                       
You may transfer Your accumulation value among the investment divisions before  
the maturity date (although We reserve the right to eliminate and/or severely   
restrict the transfer privilege in any manner We deem appropriate for some, all 
or specific contract owners). After annuitization, You may make two transfers   
each year among the Separate Account investment divisions.                      

We require a minimum amount, usually $200 (or 100% of an investment division if 
less than $200), for each transfer.                                             

See the DEFINITIONS section on page 8 for the definition of "Business Day" and  
"Valuation Period".                                                             

For more information on restrictions, procedures, and deadlines for transfers,  
see "Transaction Cut-Off Times" on page 51 and "Transfers of Accumulation Value"
on page 53. For restrictions on transfers due to market timing, see "Transfer
Limitations" on page 53.                                                        

Surrenders                                                                      

You may generally withdraw all or part of Your surrender value at any time,     
before annuity payments begin. You may also elect a systematic withdrawal option
(See "Systematic Withdrawals" on page 58). (Your retirement plan may restrict   
surrenders.) You may withdraw up to 10% of Your accumulation value as of Your   
previous anniversary each contract year without incurring a surrender charge    
(the "Free Surrender Amount"). Under non-qualified contracts, gain, if any, is  
withdrawn first for tax purposes and is taxed as ordinary income. (See "Free
Surrender Amount" on page 59).                                                  

We may impose a surrender charge on any surrender in excess of the free         
surrender amount (including surrenders to begin annuity payments), and upon full
surrender. We may also deduct an annual maintenance fee on a full surrender. The
amount You request plus any surrender charge will be deducted from Your         
accumulation value. You may take a surrender in a lump sum or use it to purchase
an annuity that will continue as long as You live or for some other period You  
select. A surrender may have negative tax consequences, including a 10% tax     
penalty on certain surrenders prior to age 59 1/2. Under non-qualified          
contracts, gain, if any, is withdrawn first for tax purposes and is taxed as    
ordinary income. (See "Surrender Charges on Surrenders" on page 61, "FEDERAL TAX
STATUS" on page 66, and "Electing An Annuity Option" on page 72.) Surrenders    
from contracts used for tax-qualified retirement plans may be restricted or     
penalized by the terms of the plan or applicable law.                           

Waiver of Surrender Charges for Nursing Home Confinement Rider                  

This rider will be attached to all contracts issued with annuitants age 75 or   
less at no additional charge. After the first contract year, We guarantee that  
We will increase the annual free surrender amount available under this contract 
from 10% of the accumulation value to 20% of the accumulation value if the      
annuitant is confined to a qualified nursing care center for a period of at     
least 90 days and the confinement is medically necessary. See "Waiver of
Surrender Charges for Nursing Home Confinement Rider" on page 59 for more       
details.                                                                        

Risk of Increase in Fees and Charges                                            
Certain fees and charges assessed against the contract are currently at levels  
below the guaranteed maximum levels. We may increase these fees and charges up  
to the guaranteed maximum level.                                                

Effects of Market Timing                                                        
Frequent, large, programmed, or short-term transfers among the investment       
divisions ("Harmful Trading) can cause risks with adverse effects for other     
contract owners (and beneficiaries and portfolios). These risks and harmful     
effects include: (1) dilution of the interests of long-term investors in an     
investment division if transfers into the division are made at unit values that 
are priced below the true value or transfers out of the investment division are 
made at unit values priced higher than the true value (some "market timers"     
attempt to do this through methods known as "time-zone arbitrage" and "liquidity
arbitrage"); (2) an adverse effect on portfolio management, such as causing the 
portfolio to maintain a higher level of cash than would otherwise be the case,  
or causing a portfolio to liquidate investments prematurely (or otherwise at an 
inopportune time) in order to pay withdrawals; and (3) increased brokerage and  
administrative expenses.                                                        

In addition, because other insurance companies and/or retirement plans may      
invest in the portfolios, the risk exists that the portfolios may suffer harm   
from frequent, programmed, large, or short-term transfers among investment      
divisions of variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among    
investment options available to retirement plan participants.                   

Generally, individuals or organizations that use market-timing strategies and   
make frequent transfers should use the investment divisions designed for        
market-timing strategies.

1The annual maintenance fee is deducted proportionally from the       
accumulation value at the time of the charge. We reserve the right to 
change this fee, however, it will not exceed $60 per contract year.   
However, if Your contract is issued while the $30 fee is in effect, We
   guarantee that this annual maintenance fee each contract year will not be
    more than $30 for the life of Your contract. The annual maintenance fee is
    reflected in the examples below by a method intended to show the "average"
impact of the annual maintenance fee on an investment in the Separate 
    Account. Assuming a $35,000 average accumulation value, the current annual
maintenance fee is 0.09% and the maximum fee is 0.17%. The annual     
   maintenance fee is deducted only when the accumulation value is less than
$50,000.                                                              
    2The mortality and expense risk charge will be determined at the beginning
     of the contract month for each contract month. Therefore, the mortality and
expense risk charge may vary from month to month depending on the     
accumulation value at the beginning of the contract month.            

    3The administration charge may vary by investment division and ranges from
  0.45% to 0.70%. Currently the fee is 0.45% for all investment divisions.
    If Your contract is issued with this fee, it is guaranteed for the life of
the contract.  See "Administration Fee" on page 63                    

     4You may select Optional Riders. You may not select a combination of riders
    that will result in total rider charges that exceed the maximum additional
mortality and expense risk charge for optional riders of 2.00%.       
5The Extra Credit Rider cannot be elected in combination with the CDSC
Rider.                                                                

6The guaranteed maximum charge for the Five for Life Plus Rider only  
applies to the initial purchase of the rider. It does not apply if You
     elect to step-up the benefit or transfer into a new asset allocation model.
 At the time You elect to "step-up," We may be charging more or less for
  this rider. See "Five for Life Plus Rider " on page 38 for more detailed
information.

Range of Annual Operating Expenses for the Portfolios1                          

The next item shows the lowest and highest total operating expenses charged by  
the currently available portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2005
(before any fee waiver or expense reimbursement). Expenses may be higher or     
lower in the future. More detail concerning each portfolio company's fees and   
expenses is contained in the prospectus for each portfolio company.

The expenses are those incurred as of the fiscal year ending December

shown.

EXPENSE EXAMPLES 

The following examples are intended to help You compare the cost of investing in
the contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts.    
These costs include contract owner transaction expenses, annual maintenance     
fees, Separate Account annual expenses, and portfolio company operating expenses
(for the year ended December 31, 2005).                                         

Both examples assume that You invest $10,000 in the contract for the time       
periods indicated.                                                              
The Examples also assume that Your investment has a 5% return each year.        
Although Your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions,  
Your costs would be:

CHARGES AND FEES 

Surrender Charge                                                                

Sales expenses are not deducted from premium payments. However, a surrender     
charge may be assessed against premium payments when they are withdrawn,        
including full and partial surrenders to effect an annuity and systematic       
withdrawals. (See "Surrender Charges on Surrenders" on page 61.)                

The length of time between the receipt of each premium payment and the surrender
determines the surrender charge. For this purpose, premium payments will be     
deemed to be withdrawn in the order in which they are received and all partial  
surrenders will be made first from premium payments and then from other         
accumulation values. The charge is a percentage of the premium withdrawn and is 
as follows:

8+                        0%                        

No Surrender charge will be assessed upon:                                      

(a)   payment of death benefits;                                        
(b)   exercise of the free look right; and                              
(c)   surrender of the free surrender amount.                           
   (d)   amounts withdrawn to pay the surrender charge on a partial surrender.

Under Midland National's current practice, amounts withdrawn under the contract 
to comply with IRS minimum distribution rules are not subject to surrender      
charges. We reserve the right to change this practice in the future.            

At the time of a withdrawal, if Your accumulation value is less than Your net   
premium, the surrender charge will still be assessed against the full remaining 
net premium amount. For example, if at the beginning of Your second contract    
year Your net premium was $10,000 and Your accumulation value was $8,000, then  
in the event of a full surrender, the second year surrender charge percentage of
7% would be charged on the $10,000 net premium amount (less the free surrender  
amount) and not the $8,000 accumulation value amount.                           

Surrenders may have tax consequences. (See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 66.)    

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge                                               

We deduct a per annum charge that ranges from 1.20% to 1.45% against all        
accumulation values held in the Separate Account for assuming the mortality and 
expense risk and other risks and expenses under the contract, including certain 
payments to third parties for distribution or investment advisory services. (See
"Mortality and Expense Risk Charge" on page 62.)                                

Administration Fee                                                              

We currently deduct a fee of 0.45% per annum against the accumulation value to  
compensate Us for the expenses associated with administration of the contract   
and operation of the investment divisions and other expenses under the contract 
including certain payments to third parties for distribution or investment      
advisory services. If Your contract is issued with this 0.45% fee, this fee is  
guaranteed for the life of Your contract and will not increase. (See            
"Administration Fee" on page 63.)                                               

Annual Maintenance Fee                                                          

We currently deduct an annual maintenance fee of $30 from each contract. We     
reserve the right to increase this charge, however, it will not exceed $60 per  
contract year. However, if Your contract is issued while the $30 fee is in      
effect, We guarantee that this annual maintenance fee each contract year will   
not be more than $30 for the life of Your contract. We waive the annual         
maintenance fee for contracts with accumulation values of $50,000 or more on the
contract anniversary. (See "Annual Maintenance Fee" on page 61.)                

Premium Taxes                                                                   

We will deduct the amount of any premium taxes levied by a state or any         
government entity from Your accumulation value at surrender, death or           
annuitization. (See "Premium Taxes" on page 65).                                

Optional Rider Charges                                                          

We deduct an additional fee if You select any of the optional riders available  
under this contract. See "FEE TABLE" on page 15.                                

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE VECTOR II VARIABLE ANNUITY

SUITABILITY OF THE CONTRACTS 

Because of the surrender charge and other expenses, the contracts are not       
appropriate for short-term investment. In addition, the contracts may be most   
appropriate for those who have already made maximum use of other tax favored    
investment plans such as IRAs and 401(k) plans. The tax-deferred feature of the 
contracts is most favorable to those in high tax brackets. The tax-deferred     
feature is not necessary for a tax-qualified plan. In such instances, purchasers
should consider whether other features, such as the death benefit and lifetime  
annuity payments, make the contract appropriate for their purposes. Before      
purchasing a contract for use in a qualified plan, You should obtain competent  
tax advice both as to the tax treatment of the contract and the suitability of  
the investment for Your particular situation.                                   

DEATH BENEFIT 

The Vector II Variable Annuity contract pays a death benefit when the annuitant 
or an owner dies before the maturity date if the contract is still inforce. If  
the oldest annuitant or owner is less than age 81 when the contract is issued,  
the death benefit is equal to the greater of (a) the accumulation value, or (b) 
total premiums minus adjustments for partial surrenders, at the time We receive 
due proof of death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid, and any 
other documents or forms required. Adjustments for partial surrenders will      
reduce the death benefit in the same proportion that the partial surrender      
reduced accumulation value at the time of the partial surrender.                

If the oldest annuitant or owner is age 81 or older when the contract is issued,
the death benefit equals the accumulation value at the time We receive due proof
of death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid, and any other     
documents or forms required. Premium taxes may be deducted from the death       
benefit proceeds and We may retain any non-vested premium bonus.                

If the annuitant or an owner dies on or after the maturity date, then any       
remaining amount's, other than the amount payable to, or for the benefit of, the
owner's surviving spouse, must be paid at least as rapidly as the benefits were 
being paid at the time of the annuitant's or owner's death. Other rules relating
to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts.                         

Other death benefits are offered as options or riders.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT C AND THE FUNDS

OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND ITS INVESTMENT DIVISIONS 

The "Separate Account" is the Midland National Life Separate Account C,         
established under the insurance laws of the State of South Dakota in March 1991 
and now governed by Iowa law. It is a unit investment trust registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of    
1940. This registration does not involve any SEC supervision of its management  
or investment contracts. The Separate Account has a number of investment        
divisions, each of which invests in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the  
funds. You may allocate part or all of Your premiums to any of the investment   
divisions of Our Separate Account. (Some restrictions may apply.)               

The Funds                                                                       

Each of the 74 portfolios available under the contract is commonly called a     
mutual fund. Each one is a "series" of one of the following open-end diversified
investment companies:

value (with no sales or surrender charge). More detailed information about the  
portfolios and their investment objectives, policies, risks, expenses and other 
aspects of their operations, appear in their prospectuses, which accompany this 
prospectus, and in the fund's Statements of Additional Information. You should  
read the portfolios' prospectuses carefully before allocating or transferring   
money to any portfolio.                                                         

We may from time to time receive revenue from the funds and/or from their       
managers. The amounts of the revenue, if any, may be substantial, may vary from 
portfolio to portfolio, and may be based on the amount of Our investment in the 
funds. Currently these revenues range from 0.35% to 0.50% of Midland's          
investment in the funds.                                                        

Investment Policies Of The Funds' Portfolios                                    
Each portfolio tries to achieve a specified investment objective by following   
certain investment policies. No one can promise that any portfolio will meet its
investment objective. A portfolio's objectives and policies affect its returns  
and risks. Each investment division's performance depends on the experience of  
the corresponding portfolio. You bear the risk that the portfolios You have     
allocated amounts to will not meet their investment objectives. The objectives  
of the portfolios are summarized below:

The funds sell their shares to Separate Accounts of various insurance companies 
to support both variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts, and to  
qualified retirement plans. We currently do not foresee any disadvantages to Our
contract owners arising from this use of the funds for mixed and shared funding.
The funds will monitor for possible conflicts arising out of this practice. If  
any such conflict or disadvantage does arise, We and/or the applicable Fund may 
take appropriate action to protect Your interests.                              

The Fund portfolios available under the contracts are not available for purchase
directly by the general public, and are not the same as the mutual funds with   
very similar or nearly identical names that are sold directly to the public.    
However, the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios are very      
similar to the investment objectives and policies of other (publicly available) 
mutual fund portfolios that have very similar or nearly identical names and that
are or may be managed by the same investment adviser or manager. Nevertheless,  
the investment performance and results of any of the funds' portfolios that are 
available under the contracts may be lower, or higher, than the investment      
results of such other (publicly available) portfolios. There can be no          
assurance, and no representation is made, that the investment results of any of 
the available portfolios will be comparable to the investment results of any    
other portfolio or mutual fund, even if the other portfolio or mutual fund has  
the same investment adviser or manager and the same investment objectives and   
policies and a very similar or nearly identical name.                           

The fund portfolios offered through the contract are selected by Midland        
National based on several criteria, including asset class coverage, the strength
of the manager's reputation and tenure, brand recognition, performance, and the 
capability and qualification of each sponsoring investment firm. Another factor 
that We consider during the selection process is whether the fund or one of its 
service providers (e.g., the investment advisor) will compensate Us for         
providing administrative, marketing, and support services that would otherwise  
be provided by the fund, the fund's investment advisor, or its distributor. (See
"Distribution of the Contracts," on page 78). You are responsible for choosing  
the fund portfolios, and the amounts allocated to each, that are appropriate for
Your own individual circumstances and Your investment goals, financial          
situation, and risk tolerance. Since investment risk is borne by You, decisions 
regarding investment allocations should be carefully considered and periodically
re-evaluated.                                                                   

In making Your investment selections, We encourage You to thoroughly investigate
all of the information regarding the fund portfolios that is available to You,  
including each fund's prospectus, statement of additional informational         
information and annual and semi/annual reports. Other sources such as the fund's
Website or newspapers and financial and other magazines provide more current    
information, including information about any regulatory actions or              
investigations related to a fund or portfolio. You should monitor and           
periodically re-evaluate Your allocations to determine if they are still        
appropriate.                                                                    

You bear the risk of any decline in the accumulation value of Your contract     
resulting from the performance of the portfolios You have chosen.               

We do not recommend or endorse any particular portfolio or portfolios and We do 
not provide investment advice.                                                  

Availability of the Portfolios                                                  
We cannot guarantee that each portfolio will always be available for investment 
through the contracts.                                                          

We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to make additions to, deletions
from, or substitutions for the shares of a portfolio that are held in the       
Separate Account. New or substitute portfolios may have different fees and      
expenses and their availability may be limited to certain classes of purchasers.
If the shares of a portfolio are no longer available for investment or if, in   
Our judgment, further investment in any portfolio should become inappropriate,  
We may redeem the shares of that portfolio, and substitute share of another     
portfolio. We will not substitute any shares without notice and prior approval  
of the SEC and state insurance authorities, to the extent required by the       
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or other applicable law.            

AMOUNTS IN OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

The amount You have in each investment division is represented by the value of  
the accumulation units credited to Your accumulation value for that investment  
division. The value You have in an investment division is the accumulation unit 
value times the number of accumulation units credited to You. Amounts allocated,
transferred or added to the investment divisions are used to purchase           
accumulation units. Accumulation units of an investment division are purchased  
when You allocate net premiums or transfer amounts to that division.            
Accumulation units are sold or redeemed when You make a full or partial         
surrender or transfer amounts from an investment division, and to pay the death 
benefit when the annuitant or an owner dies. We also redeem units to pay for    
certain charges.                                                                

We calculate the number of accumulation units purchased or redeemed in an       
investment division by dividing the dollar amount of the transaction by the     
investment division's accumulation unit value at the end of each valuation      
period, if it is a business day. If it is not a business day, We will use the   
unit value on the next business day. The number of accumulation units credited  
to You will not vary because of changes in accumulation unit values.            

The accumulation units of each investment division have different accumulation  
unit values. We determine accumulation unit values for the investment divisions 
at the end of each valuation period. The accumulation unit value for each       
investment division is initially set at $10.00. Accumulation unit values        
fluctuate with the investment performance of the corresponding portfolios of the
funds. They reflect investment income, the portfolios' realized and unrealized  
capital gains and losses, and the funds' expenses. The accumulation unit values 
also reflect the daily asset charges (which includes the mortality and expense  
risk charge and the administration fee and optional rider fees) We deduct from  
Our Separate Account, some of which are based on Your accumulation value at the 
beginning of each contract month. The daily asset charge is currently at an     
effective annual rate of 1.90% (for the basic contract only). The charge shown  
on Your base contract at issue is guaranteed for the life of Your contract. If  
You elect a rider combination with the maximum allowable mortality and expense  
risk charge for optional riders of 2.0%, the current daily asset charge is      
3.90%. The charge shown on Your base contract and rider contract at issue is    
guaranteed for the life of Your contract. Additional information on the         
accumulation unit values is contained in the SAI.                               

WE OWN THE ASSETS OF OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

We own the assets of Our Separate Account and use them to support Your contract 
and other variable annuity contracts. We may permit charges owed to Us to stay  
in the Separate Account. Thus, We may also participate proportionately in the   
Separate Account. The assets in the Separate Account are equal to the reserves  
and other liabilities of the Separate Account may not be charged with           
liabilities arising out of Our other business. The obligations under the        
contracts are Our obligations. The income, gains and losses (realized and       
unrealized) of the Separate Account are credited to or charged against the      
Separate Account without regard to Our other income, gains, or losses. Under    
certain unlikely circumstances, one investment division of the Separate Account 
may be liable for claims relating to the operations of another division.        

OUR RIGHT TO CHANGE HOW WE OPERATE OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

We have the right to modify how We operate the Separate Account. In making any  
changes, We may not seek approval of contract owners (unless approval is        
required by law). We have the right to:                                         

      o     add investment divisions to, or remove investment divisions from Our
Separate Account;                                       
o     combine two or more divisions within Our Separate Account;    
o     withdraw assets relating to Our variable annuities from one   
investment division and put them into another;          
 o     eliminate a portfolio's shares and substitute shares of another
         portfolio of the funds or another open-end, registered investment
        company. This may happen if the portfolio's shares are no longer
           available for investment or, if in Our judgment, further investment
           in the portfolio is inappropriate in view of the Separate Account's
         purposes. However, if required, We would first seek approval from
           the Securities and Exchange Commission and, the insurance regulator
where the contract is delivered;                        
   o     end the registration of Our Separate Account under the Investment
Company Act of 1940;                                    
    o     operate Our Separate Account under the direction of a committee or
    discharge such a committee at any time (the committee may be
      composed entirely of "interested persons" of Midland under the
Investment Company Act of 1940);                        
   o     disregard instructions from contract owners regarding a change in
     the investment objectives of the portfolio or the approval or
            disapproval of an investment advisory contract. (We would do so only
           if required by state insurance regulatory authorities, or otherwise
pursuant to insurance law or regulation); and           
o     operate Our Separate Account or one or more of the investment 
         divisions in any other form the law allows, including a form that
            allows Us to make direct investments. In addition, We may disapprove
         any change in investment advisors or investment policies unless a
law or regulation provides differently.                 

If any changes are made that result in a material change in the underlying      
investments of any investment division, then You will be notified. We may, for  
example, cause the investment division to invest in a mutual fund other than or 
in addition to the current portfolios.                                          

You may want to transfer the amount in that investment division as a result of  
changes We have made. If You do wish to transfer the amount You have in that    
investment division to another division of Our Separate Account, then You may do
so, without charge, by writing to Our Principal Office. At the same time, You   
may also change how Your net premiums are allocated.                            

 DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTRACT

REQUIREMENTS FOR ISSUANCE OF A CONTRACT 

The maximum issue age for the base contract is 85. However, We will issue the   
base contract with the Shortened CDSC Rider for issue ages 86 to 90. The minimum
issue age for the base contract and riders is 0.                                

To buy a contract, You must send Us an application form and an initial premium  
payment of at least $10,000 for non-qualified contract, or $2,000 for a         
qualified contract. This sale must take place through a representative who is   
licensed and registered to sell the contract. Once We accept Your application,  
You will be issued a contract that sets forth precisely Your rights and Our     
obligations. Additional premium payments, of at least $50 may then be made      
payable to Midland National Life and mailed to the Principal Office. If Your    
application is complete, then We will accept or reject it within two business   
days of receipt. If the application is incomplete, then We will attempt to      
complete it within five business days. If it is not complete at the end of this 
period (or cannot be accepted for some other reason), then We will inform You of
the reason for delay and the premium payment will be returned immediately unless
You let Us keep the premium until the application is complete. Your initial     
premium is held in a non-interest bearing suspense account (which is part of our
general account) until Your contract is issued or Your premium is refunded.     

We will allocate Your initial premium payment according to Your instructions    
when We receive it or accept Your application (whichever is later) at Our       
Principal Office. See "Transaction Cut-Off Times" on page 51 for more           
information on calculating the next available accumulation unit value based on  
the type of investment division selected in Your application.                   

There may be delays in Our receipt of applications that are outside of Our      
control because of the failure of the selling agent to forward the application  
to Us promptly, or because of delays in determining that the contract is        
suitable for You. Any such delays will affect when Your contract can be issued  
and when Your premium payment is allocated among the investment divisions of Our
Separate Account.                                                               

We offer variable annuity contracts that have different death benefits, contract
features, and optional benefits. However, these other contracts also have       
different charges that would affect Your investment performance and accumulation
value. To obtain more information about these other contracts, contact Our      
Principal Office.                                                               

FREE LOOK 

You generally have a 30-day Free Look period after You receive Your contract.   
You may review it and decide whether to keep or cancel it. If You cancel the    
contract, then You must return it to the agent who sold it to You or to Our     
Principal Office. If You cancel Your contract, then We will return:             

1.   the accumulation value less any premium bonus credit, or           
2.   if greater and if required by law, the full premium payment.       

The length of the Free Look period may vary in certain states in compliance with
specific regulations and legal requirements. The accumulation value will reflect
both the positive and negative investment performance of the investment         
divisions of Our Separate Account chosen by You in the contract application.    

TAX-FREE "SECTION 1035" EXCHANGES 

You can generally exchange one annuity contract for another in a "tax-free      
exchange" under the Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code. Before making an 
exchange, You should compare both annuities carefully. Remember that if You     
exchange another annuity for the one described in this prospectus, You might    
have to pay a surrender charge on Your old annuity, and there will be a new     
surrender charge period for this contract and other charges may be higher (or   
lower) and the benefits may be different. You should not exchange another       
annuity for this one unless You determine, after knowing all the facts, that the
exchange is in Your best interest and not just better for the person trying to  
sell You this contract (that person will generally earn a commission if You buy 
this contract through an exchange or otherwise).                                

ALLOCATION OF PREMIUM PAYMENTS 

You will specify Your desired premium allocation on the contract's application  
form. Your instructions in Your application will dictate how to allocate Your   
premiums. If an investment division is not available or requested in error, We  
will make inquiry about a replacement investment division. If We are unable to  
reach You or Your registered representative, We will consider the application   
incomplete. We may retain Your premium payment for up to 5 business days while  
attempting to complete the application. If the application cannot be completed  
within this time frame, We will inform You of the reason(s) for the delay. We   
will also return the premium payment immediately unless You consent to allow Us 
to hold the premium payment until the application is completed, in any case no  
longer than 19 total days. If You choose to have us hold the premium payment, it
will be held in a non-interest bearing account.                                 

Once the completed application is received, We will allocate the payment to the 
investment divisions specified by You. Allocation percentages may be any whole  
number (from 0 to 100) and the sum must equal 100. The allocation instructions  
in Your application will apply to all other premiums You pay, unless You change 
subsequent premium allocations by providing Us with written instructions. We    
reserve the right to limit the number of investment divisions in which You can  
have funds invested                                                             

Changing Your Premium Allocation Percentages                                    

You may change the allocation percentages of Your premiums by writing to Our    
Principal Office and telling Us what changes You wish to make. These changes    
will effect transactions as of the date We receive Your request at Our Principal
Office. Changing Your allocation instructions will not change the way Your      
existing contract fund is apportioned among the investment divisions. While the 
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) program is in effect, the allocation percentages    
that apply to any premiums received will be the DCA allocation percentages      
unless You specify otherwise. (See "Dollar Cost Averaging" on page 56).         

OPTIONAL RIDERS 

There are several optional riders available under this contract for an          
additional charge. With some restrictions noted in the descriptions below, You  
may elect a combination of these riders as long as the additional mortality and 
expense risk charge for the combination of riders does not exceed 2.00% (so the 
total asset charge cannot exceed 3.90% currently. In addition, if You elect the 
Five for Life Plus Rider, the mortality and expense risk charge could change if 
You elect to "step-up" Your GPB. This "step-up" may cause the total current     
rider charges to exceed 2.00%.                                                  

Some of the optional riders cannot be terminated once elected. Therefore, You   
should review and select optional riders carefully.                             

Five for Life Plus Rider                                                        
If You elect the Five for Life Plus Rider, We guarantee that each contract year 
You may take withdrawals up to an amount equal to the GPA until Your GPB is     
depleted, even if Your accumulation value reduces to zero. This rider also      
provides for an alternate guarantee during the life of the covered person       
(oldest owner) specified under this Rider. This alternate benefit guarantees    
that each contract year during the life of the covered person You may take      
withdrawals up to an amount equal to the LPA, even if Your accumulation value   
and GPB reduce to zero. The LPA is only available after the covered person has  
reached age 65. Both the GPA and LPA may increase with each premium payment and 
may be reduced if withdrawals within a contract year exceed either the GPA or   
LPA.                                                                            

The GPA, LPA and GPB can increase by a bonus amount for the first five years    
after election of the rider. For each contract year in which no withdrawal is   
taken during the first five years after the rider is issued, a 2% bonus credit  
will be added to the GPB and could adjust the GPA and LPA; however, if total    
withdrawals in any of the first five contract years exceed the GPA, then the    
bonus credit provision will be terminated and no future bonus credits will be   
received.                                                                       

If the Five for Life Plus Rider is elected with the Extra Credit Rider, the GPB 
will reflect the premium bonus. See "Extra Credit Rider" on page 42 for more    
information. If either the total GPA or LPA is not withdrawn in any contract    
year, this amount will not carry over for withdrawals in future years.          

This rider can be elected at issue or on any contract anniversary.              

In exchange for this benefit, We will deduct an extra daily mortality and       
expense charge at an annual rate that is 0.65%. However, the charge shown on    
Your base contract when this rider is elected is guaranteed for the life of Your
contract, unless You elect to "step-up" Your GPB. This charge is assessed       
against Your Separate Account accumulation value. The charges for this rider are
listed in the "FEE TABLE" on page 15.                                           

The GPA and LPA will be different calculated amounts. When You make a           
withdrawal, You do not need to specify whether it is a GPA or LPA withdrawal. If
the withdrawal taken in a contract year does not exceed the LPA, neither the LPA
nor GPA will be recalculated. If the withdrawal taken exceeds the LPA but not   
the GPA, the LPA could be reduced and the GPA will remain the same value. If the
withdrawal taken exceeds both the GPA and LPA, both the GPA and LPA could be    
reduced.                                                                        

Anything withdrawn up to the GPA or LPA is considered a penalty free withdrawal.
If the payment amount exceeds the 10% penalty free amount, any surrender charges
will be waived up to the GPA or LPA. If the payment amount exceeds the 10%      
penalty free withdrawal amount and the requested withdrawal exceeds the GPA or  
LPA, surrender charges will be applied on the withdrawal amount that exceeds the
GPA or LPA.                                                                     

Step-Up Provisions:                                                             
After the rider has been inforce for five consecutive contract years and after  
every fifth contract anniversary thereafter, You have the option to "step-up"   
the GPB. You may "step-up" this rider until the earlier of the covered person's 
age 80 or the 30th contract anniversary after this rider is elected. This allows
You to increase the GPB to equal the current accumulation value as of the       
eligible contract anniversary date. You have 30 calendar days after each        
eligible contract anniversary, to notify Us, in writing or via facsimile, that  
You have chosen this option. We will not accept any request to exercise the     
"step-up" benefit after the 30th calendar day following any eligible            
anniversary. You may not exercise the option to "step-up" if Your current GPB is
higher than Your current accumulation value. The guaranteed maximum rider charge
noted in the Fee Table only applies to the initial purchase of the rider. It    
does not apply if You elect to "step-up" the GPB. At the time You elect to      
"step-up," We may be charging more or less for this rider. Regardless of when   
You purchased the rider, We will charge You the current charge at the time You  
elect to "step-up" Your GPB. Before You decide to "step-up," You should request 
a current prospectus which will describe the current charge for this benefit.   

Upon a Step-Up of the GPB, the GPA will equal the greater of:                   

1.  the current GPA before the Step-Up of the GPB; or                   
2.  7% multiplied by the GPB immediately after the Step-Up.             

Upon a Step-Up of the GPB, the LPA will equal the greater of:                   

1.  the current LPA before the Step-Up of the GPB; or                   
2.  5% multiplied by the GPB immediately after the Step-Up.             

Withdrawal Provisions:                                                          
If total withdrawals during a contract year are less than or equal to the GPA,  
then the GPB will decrease by the amount of the withdrawals. If total           
withdrawals during a contract year exceed the GPA, then the GPB will be         
automatically reset to equal the lesser of:                                     

1.  the contract's accumulation value after the withdrawal; or          
2.  the GPB prior to the withdrawal minus the amount of the withdrawal. 

If total withdrawals during a contract year are less than or equal to the GPA,  
then the GPA does not change as a result of the withdrawal. If a withdrawal     
causes total withdrawals during a contract year to exceed the GPA, then the GPA 
will become the lesser of:                                                      

1.   the GPA prior to the withdrawal; or                                
2.   7% multiplied by the greater of:                                   
        1)   the contract accumulation value immediately after the withdrawal;
or                                                  
     2)   the GPB immediately after the withdrawal (as calculated in the
GPB withdrawal provision).                          

If total withdrawals during a contract year are less than or equal to the LPA,  
then the LPA does not change as a result of the withdrawal. If a withdrawal     
causes total withdrawals during a contract year to exceed the LPA, then the LPA 
will become the lesser of:                                                      

1.   the LPA prior to the withdrawal; or                                
2.   5% multiplied by the greater of:                                   
        1)   the contract accumulation value immediately after the withdrawal;
or                                                  
     2)   the GPB immediately after the withdrawal (as calculated in the
GPB withdrawal provision).                          

Premium Payment Provisions:                                                     
Each time an additional premium is received, the GPA will equal the greater of: 

1.   the current GPA before the premium; or                             
2.   the lesser of:                                                     
1)   7% multiplied by the GPB after the premium; or           
  2)   the current GPA before the premium plus the premium payment
including premium bonus (if any) multiplied by 7%.  

Each time an additional premium is received, the LPA will equal the greater of: 

1.   the current LPA before the premium; or                             
2.   the lesser of:                                                     
1)   5% multiplied by the GPB after the premium; or           
  2)   the current LPA before the premium plus the premium payment
including extra credit (if any) multiplied by 5%.   

Bonus Credit Provisions:                                                        
Applies to the first five contract years after election of the Five for Life    
Plus Rider. At the end of each contract year in which a withdrawal was not      
taken, the GPB amount is increased by an amount equal to 2% of the original GPB 
(unless there were withdrawals in any contract year that exceeded the GPA).     

Upon the GPB being increased by a bonus credit, the GPA will equal the greater  
of:                                                                             

1.   the current GPA before the bonus credit; or                        
2.   7%  multiplied by the GPB immediately after the bonus credit.      

Upon the GPB being increased by a bonus credit, the LPA will equal the greater  
of:                                                                             

1.   the current LPA before the Bonus Credit; or                        
2.   5%  multiplied by the GPB immediately after the bonus credit.      

See "Appendix I" on page 83 for examples of how the Five for Life Plus rider    
works.                                                                          

Under this rider, We reserve the right to restrict investment divisions at any  
time. If an investment division is restricted, no transfers into the restricted 
investment divisions will be allowed and no premiums may be allocated to the    
restricted investment divisions after the date of the restriction. Any amounts  
previously allocated to an investment division that is subsequently restricted  
will be unaffected by such restrictions. There are no current investment        
division restrictions. We guarantee that if Your contract is issued when there  
are no investment division restrictions, no investment division restrictions are
guaranteed for the life of Your contract.                                       

Under this rider, We also reserve the right to limit the actual percentages     
allocated to certain investment divisions, to require that certain investment   
divisions be chosen in conjunction with other investment divisions, to limit    
transfers between existing investment divisions and/or to require periodic      
rebalancing of existing investment divisions to the required percentages. There 
are no current allocation requirements. We guarantee that if Your contract is   
issued when there are no allocation requirements, no allocation requirements are
guaranteed for the life of Your contract.                                       

If You do not elect this rider when You purchase the contract, You have 30-days 
from any contract anniversary date to notify Us, in writing or via facsimile,   
that You have chosen to elect this rider. The GPB will be equal to the          
accumulation value as of the eligible contract anniversary date. Any            
transactions that have occurred between the eligible contract anniversary date  
and rider election date could affect the GPB, GPA and LPA.                      

If Your IRS minimum required distribution amount exceeds Your payment amount    
under the Five for Life Plus feature, You will be required to withdraw more than
the Five for Life Plus payment amount to avoid the imposition of a 50% excise   
tax, causing a decrease in Your GPB. You should consult with and rely on Your   
own tax advisor before purchasing the Five for Life Plus rider with a qualified 
contract.                                                                       

If You exercise the right to examine provision in the contract, You will not    
receive any portion of the GPB from the Five for Life Plus Rider.               

It is not clear (i) how gain is computed when a partial surrender is made and   
the GPB, GPA or LPA is greater than your accumulation value or (ii) whether     
payments made after the contract's accumulation value is zero will be taxed as  
partial surrenders or as annuity payments. Similarly for qualified contracts, We
will apply the non-annuity rules for determining minimum required distributions,
meaning that a percentage of the value of all benefits under the contract will  
need to be withdrawn each year. The value may have to include the value of      
enhanced death benefits and other optional contract provisions such as the Five 
for Life Plus Rider itself. Consult with and rely upon Your own tax advisor     
prior to purchasing this rider. See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 66 for a       
general description of the taxation of withdrawals and annuity payments.        

This rider will terminate:                                                      

o     upon death of the annuitant or an owner unless the contract is
           continued under a spousal continuation option. Spousal continuation
        allows a surviving spouse, if named the beneficiary, to continue
        receiving the GPA amount until the GPB is depleted or the spouse
        dies, whichever occurs first, and then the rider will terminate.
o     if You write to Us requesting termination of the rider; or    
o     if You surrender or annuitize Your contract.                  

If the rider terminates in the middle of a contract year, You will still have   
the right to withdraw Your full GPA that year. If the rider terminates for any  
reason other than a full surrender of the contract, We will continue the charge 
against Your accumulation value until the next contract anniversary date. If You
surrender Your contract in the middle of a contract year the charge will        
terminate at that time so You will only pay a prorated proportion of the rider  
charge. Once this rider has terminated it cannot be elected again at a later    
date.                                                                           

The maximum GPB for this rider is $5,000,000. The maximum issue ages are 75 for 
single annuitants or owners and age 80 for joint annuitants or owners. We may   
consider exceptions to the maximum issue ages. Each request for age exceptions  
will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to request       
additional information in order to evaluate suitability for the annuitants or   
owners.                                                                         

The Five for Life Plus Rider may not be elected in combination with the GMIB    
Plus or the Estate Planning riders.                                             

Extra Credit Rider                                                              
If You select the Extra Credit Rider, You may choose between a 3%, 4% or 5%     
premium bonus amount at the time You apply for the contract. We will apply a    
credit of 3%, 4% or 5%, depending on the amount chosen, to each premium payment 
that You make in the first contract year. In exchange for this credit, We will  
charge You an additional fee as shown in the table below.

This charge is applied against Your Separate Account accumulation value each    
year during the first seven contract years. Over time, the amount of the fees   
may exceed the amount of the premium bonus credited. We expect to profit from   
the extra charge for this rider. In general, in order to receive a benefit from 
this rider, the Separate Account must experience a certain level of positive    
performance over a number of years and the contract must not be surrendered     
during the first seven years. Generally, the higher the first year premium and  
the higher the rate of return, the more advantageous the Extra Credit Rider     
becomes and vice versa.                                                         

Because the charge associated with the Extra Credit Rider will be assessed      
against the entire Separate Account value for the first seven contract years,   
contract owners who anticipate making additional premium payments after the     
first contract year should carefully examine the Extra Credit Rider and consult 
their financial adviser regarding its desirability. Note carefully that the     
charge will be assessed against the Separate Account accumulation value         
attributable to premium payments made in years one through seven, but no premium
bonus will be credited with respect to premium payments made anytime after the  
first contract year.                                                            

If You exercise the right to examine provision in the contract, You will not    
receive any portion of the premium bonus amount. Generally, in the event of     
death, withdrawal, annuitization, or surrender of the contract in the first     
seven contract years, You or Your beneficiary(ies) will only be entitled to that
portion of the premium bonus, if any, that has vested at the time the event     
occurs. The amount vested will increase over the seven-year period so that, in  
contract years 8+, You or Your beneficiary(ies) will be entitled to 100% of the 
premium bonus amount. However, by current company practice, upon death of an    
owner or annuitant in the first seven contract years, the vesting schedule will 
not be applied and Your beneficiary(ies) will receive the full bonus amount.    
This is not guaranteed. However, if Your contract is issued while this company  
practice is in effect, We guarantee that You will receive this company practice 
for the life of Your contract. The vesting schedule for the Extra Credit Rider  
is shown in the table below.

          5                             8/12 of premium bonus amount

          8+                           12/12 of premium bonus amount

This vesting schedule does not apply and no bonus recapture will be taken from  
withdrawals made under the free surrender amount provision of Your contract.    

Keep in mind, all withdrawals are taken on a first in, first out basis, which   
means withdrawals will be taken from the first premium received by Us and then  
the second premium received (if any), and so on until the total withdrawal      
amount is reached. Any withdrawals taken from premiums received in the first    
contract year will only be entitled to that portion of the premium bonus, if    
any, that has vested at the time the withdrawal is taken.                       

The Internal Revenue Code generally requires that any interest in a qualified   
contract be nonforfeitable, and it is unclear whether the optional Extra Credit 
Rider is consistent with those requirements. Consult a tax advisor before       
purchasing this rider as part of a qualified contract.                          

The Extra Credit Rider may not be elected in combination with the Shortened CDSC
Rider.                                                                          

GMIB Plus (Guaranteed Minimum Income and Accumulation Benefit) Rider            

If You elect the GMIB Plus Rider, We guarantee that, after the rider has been   
inforce for at least 10 years, We will pay You a Guaranteed Minimum Income      
Benefit (GMIB) if You elect to annuitize Your contract, and, on the 15th        
contract anniversary after the rider has been inforce, Your accumulation value  
will be increased to equal the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB),  
if it is higher than Your accumulation value.                                   

This rider can be elected at the time of issue or on any contract anniversary   
after issue for an additional charge. The rider must be inforce for a minimum of
10 years before any benefit is available.                                       

The current charge for this rider is 0.50% of accumulation value per year. The  
charge shown on Your base contract when this rider is elected is guaranteed for 
the life of Your contract.                                                      

On the 15th contract anniversary after this rider has been inforce (and only on 
this date), Your contract's accumulation value will be increased to the GMAB if 
Your contract's accumulation value is less than the GMAB on that date.          

If the rider is elected at issue, the initial GMAB will equal the initial       
premium payment. If this rider is elected along with the Extra Credit Rider at  
the time of issue, the GMAB will reflect the premium bonus credited to Your     
contract. If the GMAB is elected at a later date, the initial GMAB is equal to  
the current accumulation value.                                                 

The GMAB on the 15th contract anniversary after this rider has been inforce will
equal:                                                                          

1.    Initial GMAB; plus                                                
2.    Subsequent premium payments after rider election, if any; minus   
3.    Adjustments for partial surrenders after rider election, if any.  

The GMAB adjustment for partial surrenders is reduced on a dollar for dollar    
basis each time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction of 5% of
the accumulation value as of the contract's last anniversary. If the total      
partial surrenders in any one contract year exceed the 5% reduction level, the  
partial surrender amount above this level will reduce the GMAB benefit by the   
same proportion that the partial surrender amount above the 5% level reduced the
accumulation value at the time the partial surrender was taken.                 

If You must take IRS minimum required distributions before the rider has been   
inforce for ten years, Your GMAB amount will be reduced. Consult with and rely  
on Your own tax advisor if You are considering purchasing this rider with a     
qualified contract.                                                             

If the rider is elected at issue, the initial GMIB accumulated value will equal 
the initial premium payment. If this rider is elected along with the Extra      
Credit Rider at the time of issue, the GMIB accumulated value will reflect the  
premium bonus credited to Your contract. If the GMIB is elected at a later date,
the initial GMIB accumulated value is equal to the current accumulation value.  

If You elect to annuitize Your contract anytime after the 10 year waiting period
then, except with respect to certain investment divisions as noted below the    
GMIB accumulated value will equal the greater of:                               

1.   the GMIB roll-up benefit; or                                       
2.   the GMIB annual step-up benefit.                                   

GMIB roll-up benefit means the initial GMIB accumulated value at the time this  
rider is issued compounded at a rate of 5% annually until the contract          
anniversary after the earlier of the owner's or annuitant's 80th birthday. The  
GMIB roll-up benefit is increased each time a premium payment is received after 
the date the rider is issued and is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis each   
time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction of 5% of the       
accumulation value as of the contract's last anniversary. If the total partial  
surrenders in any one contract year exceed the 5% reduction level, the partial  
surrender amount above this level will reduce the GMIB roll-up benefit by the   
same proportion that the partial surrender amount above the 5% level reduced the
accumulation value at the time of the partial surrender.                        

The GMIB annual step-up benefit equals the initial GMIB accumulated value at the
time this rider is elected. The GMIB annual step-up benefit is recalculated on  
the first contract anniversary after rider election and every contract          
anniversary thereafter, until the contract anniversary after the owner's or     
annuitant's 80th birthday. The annual step-up benefit on each contract          
anniversary is the greater of the current annual step-up benefit or the         
accumulation value on that contract anniversary. The current annual step-up     
benefit is the previous anniversary step-up benefit adjusted for any premiums   
and withdrawals that have occurred over the contract year. The annual step-up   
benefit calculated on the contract anniversary applies until the next contract  
anniversary, or until You make a subsequent premium payment or partial surrender
at which time it will recalculate. Any subsequent premium payments will         
immediately increase the annual step-up benefit. Any partial surrender will     
immediately decrease the annual step-up benefit. The annual step-up benefit is  
reduced on a dollar for dollar basis each time a partial surrender is taken     
until there is a reduction of 5% of the accumulation value as of the contract's 
last anniversary. If the total partial surrenders in any one contract year      
exceed the 5% reduction level, the partial surrender amount above this level    
will reduce the GMIB step-up benefit by the same proportion that the partial    
surrender amount above the 5% level reduced the accumulation value at the time  
the partial surrender was taken. The partial surrender decrease on the annual   
step-up benefit could be more or less than the dollar amount withdrawn.         

Certain investment divisions within the Separate Account will have a 0% rate for
determining the GMIB roll-up benefit. There is no roll-up for money allocated to
these divisions. If money is allocated in an investment division with a 0% rate,
the GMIB roll-up benefit will be less than it would be if the money was         
allocated to other investment divisions. The investment divisions with the 0%   
rate are:                                                                       

o     Rydex VT U.S. Government Money Market Fund                    
o     ProFund VP Money Market                                       

We reserve the right to restrict investment divisions at any time when this     
rider is elected. If an investment divisions is restricted, and the GMIB Plus   
Rider has been elected, no transfers into the restricted investment divisions   
will be allowed and no premiums may be allocated to the restricted investment   
divisions after the date of the restriction. Any amounts previously allocated to
an investment divisions that is subsequently restricted will be unaffected by   
such restriction. There are currently no restricted investment divisions. We    
guarantee that if Your contract is issued when there are no investment division 
restrictions, no investment division restrictions are guaranteed for the life of
Your contract.                                                                  

The GMIB accumulated value is only used to determine the GMIB income payment    
upon annuitization of Your contract under the terms of this rider and is not an 
accumulation value that can be withdrawn as a full or partial surrender.        
However, the GMAB is a value that can be withdrawn as a full surrender. After   
the 10-year waiting period and upon annuitization, the GMIB income payment      
amount will be the greater of:                                                  

     o     the income payment available to You under the base contract without
the GMIB, or;                                           
     o     the GMIB accumulated value multiplied by the GMIB income factor and
then dividing by 1,000.                                 

The GMIB income factor equals the base contract's payout factors used in the    
contract form under "Settlement Options" with an 8-year age set-back. An age    
set-back results in lower payments than without an age set-back, and the        
difference could be substantial.                                                

The income payout options (both fixed and variable) available to You under this 
rider are:                                                                      

    o     Income for life only (single or joint life with full survivorship)
o     Income for life with 10 year certain (single life only).      

Once elected, this rider cannot be terminated. This rider will only terminate:  

    o     on upon the death of the annuitant or owner unless the contract is
          continued under a spousal continuation option (spousal continuance
           option allows a surviving owner's spouse, if named the beneficiary,
to continue the contract as the new owner; or           
o     if You surrender Your contract.                               

If You surrender Your contract in the middle of a contract year the charge will 
terminate at that time so You will only pay a prorated portion of the rider     
charge. Once this rider has terminated it cannot be elected again at a later    
date.                                                                           

The maximum issue age for this rider is 75. The maximum annuitization age for   
this rider is 85.                                                               

You should note that the GMIB Plus Rider is designed to provide a type of       
insurance that serves as a safety net only in the event Your accumulation value 
declines significantly due to negative investment performance. Depending on the 
performance of Your investment divisions, purchase of the GMIB Plus Rider may   
not result in You receiving larger annuity payments or having a higher          
accumulation value than if You had not purchased the GMIB Plus Rider.           

This rider may not be elected in combination with the Five for Life Plus Rider. 

See "Appendix II" on page 86 for examples of how the GMIB Plus Rider works.

GMDB Plus roll-up benefit means the initial premium at the time this rider is   
elected compounded at the specified roll-up interest rate (limited to an        
additional 100% of premiums with adjustments for partial surrenders or until age
85). For the purposes of this rider, if You elected the Extra Credit Rider at   
the time the contract was issued, the amount of the bonus You received will not 
be included as part of Your initial benefit amount. The roll-up benefit is      
increased each time a premium payment is received and is reduced on a dollar for
dollar basis each time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction  
of 6% of the accumulation value as of the contract's last anniversary. If the   
total partial surrenders in any one contract year exceed the 6% reduction level,
the partial surrender amount above the 6% level will reduce the GMDB Plus       
roll-up benefit by the same proportion that the partial surrender amount above  
the 6% level reduced the accumulation value at the time of the partial          
surrender.                                                                      

The GMDB Plus annual step-up benefit initially equals the initial premium at the
time this rider is elected. For the purposes of this rider, if You elected the  
Extra Credit Rider at the time the contract was issued, the amount of the bonus 
You received will not be included as part of Your initial premium amount. The   
GMDB Plus annual step-up benefit is recalculated on the first contract          
anniversary after rider election and every contract anniversary thereafter,     
until the contract anniversary after the owner's or annuitant's 85th birthday.  
The annual step-up benefit on the contract anniversary is the greater of the    
current annual step-up benefit or the accumulation value on that contract       
anniversary. The current annual step-up benefit is the previous anniversary     
step-up benefit adjusted for any premiums and withdrawals that have occurred    
over the contract year. The annual step-up benefit calculated on the contract   
anniversary applies until the next contract anniversary, or until You make a    
subsequent premium payment or partial surrender at which time it will           
recalculate. Any subsequent premium payments will immediately increase the      
annual step-up benefit. The annual step-up benefit is reduced on a dollar for   
dollar basis each time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction  
of 6% of the accumulation value as of the contract's last anniversary. If the   
total partial surrenders in any one contract year exceed the 6% reduction level,
the partial surrender amount above this 6% level will reduce the GMDB Plus      
step-up benefit by the same proportion that the partial surrender amount above  
the 6% limit reduced the accumulation value at the time of the partial          
surrender.                                                                      

Certain investment divisions within the Separate Account will have a 0% rate for
determining the GMDB Plus roll-up benefit. There is no roll-up for money        
allocated to these divisions. If money is allocated in an investment division   
with a 0% rate, the GMDB Plus roll-up benefit will be less than it would bethe  
money was allocated to other investment divisions . The investment divisions    
with a 0% rate under this rider include:                                        

o     Rydex VT U.S. Government Money Market Fund                    
o     ProFund VP Money Market                                       

Once elected, You cannot terminate this rider. This rider will only terminate:  

    o     upon the death of the annuitant or an owner unless the contract is
          continued under a spousal continuation option (spousal continuance
         allows the surviving owner's spouse, if named the beneficiary, to
continue the contract as the new owner), or             
o     if You surrender the contract.                                

If You surrender Your contract in the middle of a contract year the charge will 
terminate at that time so You will only pay a prorated portion of the rider     
charge. Once this rider has terminated it cannot be elected again at a later    
date.                                                                           

The maximum issue age for this rider is 75.                                     

You should note that the GMDB Plus is designed to provide a type of insurance   
that serves as a safety net only in the event Your accumulation value declines  
significantly due to negative investment performance. Depending on the          
performance of Your investment divisions, the purchase of this rider may not    
result in Your beneficiary receiving a larger death benefit than if You had not 
purchased the GMDB Plus Rider.                                                  

Shortened CDSC (Contingent Deferred Sales Charge) Rider                         

If You elect this rider on Your application, You have three choices regarding   
the duration of the surrender charge period (the number of years the surrender  
charge remains in effect). You have the option of shortening the regular        
surrender charge period of seven years to four years, three years or none (no   
surrender charge). There is an extra charge for this rider as noted in the "FEE
TABLE" on page 15. The amount of the charge depends on which shorter period You 
choose, as indicated below. The charge is a percentage (specified below) of the 
average daily accumulation value, and the charge remains in effect until the    
contract is terminated.                                                         

You can elect this rider only when You purchase the contract.                   

This rider cannot be elected in combination with the Extra Credit Rider.

The above chart demonstrates that, unless You either surrender this contract or 
take a partial surrender in excess of the penalty free amount in 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7
years after a premium payment is made, You will get no benefit from this rider. 

Zero Year Surrender Charge Period                                 

 The "zero year" surrender charge period means there is no surrender
charge, even in the first contract year.                          

Estate Planning Rider                                                           
If You elect this rider on Your application, then We will provide an extra death
benefit of 40% of the gain (if any) in this contract upon the death of the      
annuitant or an owner prior to the maturity date. Gain is calculated by         
comparing Your net premiums to Your accumulation value at the time of Your      
death. This rider is only available for non-qualified contracts.                

This rider may not be elected in combination with the Five for Life Plus Rider. 

The maximum extra death benefit is limited to 50% of the net premiums. If You   
have no gain when the death benefit is calculated, then Your beneficiary will   
receive no benefit. For either the oldest owner or annuitant the maximum issue  
age for this rider is age 75.                                                   

We will deduct an additional daily charge against Your Separate Account         
accumulation value (until the maturity date) at the annual rate listed in the   
Fee Table. We continue to deduct this charge even during periods when there is  
no gain in the accumulation value and, therefore, no benefits available.        

Mutually Exclusive Riders                                                       

As indicated above, some of the riders are mutually exclusive and cannot be     
selected with certain of the other riders. The following chart sets out which   
rider(s) You may not select if You select one of the mutually exclusive riders:

YOUR ACCUMULATION VALUE 

Your accumulation value is the sum of Your amounts in the various investment    
divisions of Our Separate Account. Your accumulation value reflects the         
investment performance of the portfolios in the investment divisions, any       
premium payments made, any surrenders, any transfers, withdrawals, and any      
charges assessed in connection with the contract. There is no guaranteed minimum
accumulation value. You bear the investment risk. An investment division's      
performance will cause Your accumulation value to go up or down. Transaction and
surrender charges are made on the effective date of the transaction. Charges    
against Our Separate Account are reflected daily.                               

Transaction Cut-Off Times                                                       
We have established specific cut-off times that will allow Us to process Your   
financial transaction requests as of the end of each valuation period. The      
deadline depends on the type of financial transaction, method used for          
submitting the transaction requests, and type of investment division (2x Fund or
a non-2x Fund).                                                                 

Financial transactions must be in good order. Financial transactions include    
premium payments, death benefits, full or partial surrender requests, transfers,
dollar cost averaging programs, portfolio rebalancing, and systematic           
withdrawals. The following transaction cut-off times have been established in   
order to allow Us sufficient time to process Your transaction request:

day" on page 8                                                                  

For transfer requests from one 2x Fund to another received by phone at Our      
Principal Office before 9:00 a.m. Central Time on any business day and after    
2:00 p.m. Central Time on the previous business day will receive the            
accumulation unit value calculated at the close of that mornings valuation      
period (usually 9:45 a.m. Central Time). Transfer requests from one 2x Fund to  
another received at Our Principal Office after 9:00 a.m. Central Time on any    
business day and before 2:00 p.m. Central Time on that same business day will   
receive the accumulation unit value calculated at the close of that day's       
regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange (usually 3:00 p.m.       
Central Time). See definition of "Business day" on page 8.                      

The cut-off times for completed transfer requests varies depending on the medium
used to transmit Your request and the type of investment division involved in   
the transfer. Generally, for transfer requests from one 2x Fund to another, We  
extend the cut-off time to 25 minutes prior to the valuation time (generally    
9:20 a.m. Central Time for the morning valuation period and 2:35 p.m. Central   
Time for the afternoon valuation period) only for transfer requests submitted   
electronically through the Company's internet Web site. Only a registered       
investment advisor authorized by You to make transfers on Your behalf can submit
transfer requests via the internet. See "Transfers of Accumulation Value" below.

Transfers of Accumulation Value                                                 
You generally may transfer amounts among the investment divisions prior to      
maturity date.                                                                  

You may make an unlimited number of transfers of accumulation value in each     
contract year prior to the maturity date (subject to the "Transfer Limitations" 
on page 53).                                                                    

The minimum transfer amount is $200 or 100% of an investment division if less   
than $200. The minimum amount does not have to come from or be transferred to   
just one investment division. The only requirement is that the total amount     
transferred that day equals the transfer minimum.                               

See the definition of business day and valuation period in the "DEFINITIONS"    
section on page 8. See "Transaction Cut-Off Times" above.                       

After Annuitization (the maturity date), You can make only two transfers per    
contract year.                                                                  

We reserve the right to terminate, modify, and/or severely restrict the transfer
privilege in any manner We deem appropriate for some, all or specific contract  
owners if required by Our business judgment or in accordance with applicable    
law.                                                                            

TRANSFER LIMITATIONS 

Frequent, large, programmed, or short-term transfers among investment divisions,
such as those associated with "market timing" transactions, can adversely affect
the portfolios and the returns achieved by contract owners. In particular, such 
transfers may dilute the value of the portfolios' shares, interfere with the    
efficient management of the portfolios' investments, and increase brokerage and 
administrative costs of the portfolios. In order to try to protect Our contract 
owners and the portfolios from potentially harmful trading activity, We have    
implemented certain market timing policies and procedures (the "market timing   
procedures"). Our market timing procedures are designed to detect and prevent   
frequent or short-term transfer activity among the investment divisions of the  
Separate Account that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolio   
shareholders.                                                                   

More specifically, currently Our market timing procedures are intended to detect
potentially harmful trading or transfer activity by monitoring for any two      
interfund transfer requests on a contract within a five business day period, in 
which the requests are moving to and from identical subaccounts (for example, a 
transfer from American Century VP Income & Growth Fund to Van Kampen UIF        
Emerging Markets Debt Portfolio, followed by a transfer from Van Kampen UIF     
Emerging Markets Debt Portfolio back to American Century VP Income & Growth Fund
within five business days).                                                     

We review transfer requests, daily blotters, and transaction logs in an attempt 
to identify transfers that exceed these transfer parameters. When We identify a 
second trade within five days of the first, We will review those transfers (and 
other transfers in the same contract) to determine if, in Our judgment, the     
transfers are part of a market timing strategy or otherwise have the potential  
to be harmful. We will honor and process the second transfer request, but if We 
believe that the activity is potentially harmful, We will suspend that          
contract's transfer privileges and We will not accept another transfer request  
for 14 business days. We will attempt to inform the contract owner (or          
Registered Representative) by telephone that their transfers have been deemed   
potentially harmful to others and that their transfer privilege is suspended for
14 days. If We do not succeed in reaching the contract owner or Registered      
Representative by phone, We will send a letter by first class mail to the       
contract owner's address of record.                                             

In addition to Our own market timing procedures, managers of the investment     
portfolios might contact Us if they believe or suspect that there is market     
timing or other potentially harmful trading, and, if so, We will take           
appropriate action to protect others. In particular, We may, and We reserve the 
right to, reject or reverse a potentially harmful transfer. If so, We will      
inform the contract owner and/or Registered Representative. The contract owner  
will bear any investment loss involved in a reversal.                           

To the extent permitted by applicable law, We reserve the right to delay or     
reject a transfer request at any time that We are unable to purchase or redeem  
shares of any of the portfolios available through Separate Account C, because of
any refusal or restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares on the   
part of the managers of the investment portfolios as a result of their own      
policies and procedures on market timing activities or other potentially abusive
transfers. If this occurs, We will attempt to contact You by telephone for      
further instructions. If We are unable to contact You within 5 business days    
after We have been advised that Your transfer request has been refused or       
delayed by the investment portfolio manager, the amount intended for transfer   
will be retained in or returned to the originating investment division. You     
should also be aware that We expect to be contractually obligated to prohibit   
transfers by contract owners identified by a portfolio and to provide contract  
owner transaction data to the portfolios. You should read the prospectuses of   
the portfolios for more details on their ability to refuse or restrict purchases
or redemptions of their shares.                                                 

In Our sole discretion, We may revise Our market timing procedures at any time  
without prior notice as We deem necessary or appropriate to better detect and   
deter frequent, programmed, large, or short-term transfers that may adversely   
affect other contract owners or portfolio shareholders, to comply with state or 
federal regulatory requirements, or to impose additional or alternate           
restrictions on market timers (such as dollar or percentage limits on           
transfers). We may change Our parameters to monitor for a different number of   
transfers with different time periods, and We may include other factors, such as
the size of transfers made by contract owners within given periods of time, as  
Well as the number of "round trip" transfers into and out of particular         
investment divisions. For purposes of applying the parameters used to detect    
potential market timing and other potentially harmful activity, We may aggregate
transfers made in two or more contracts that We believe are connected (for      
example, two contracts with the same owner, or owned by spouses, or owned by    
different partnerships or corporations that are under common control, etc.).    

We do not include transfers made pursuant to the dollar cost averaging program  
and portfolio rebalancing program in these limitations. We may vary Our market  
timing procedures from investment division to investment division, and may be   
more restrictive with regard to certain investment divisions than others. We may
not always apply these detections methods or limitations to investment divisions
investing in portfolios that, in Our judgment, would not be particularly        
attractive to market timers or otherwise susceptible to harm by frequent        
transfers.                                                                      

We reserve the right to place restrictions on the methods of implementing       
transfers for all contract owners that We believe might otherwise engage in     
trading activity that is harmful to others. For example, We might only accept   
transfers by original "Wet" contract owner signature conveyed through the U.S.  
mail (that is, We can refuse transfer requests submitted by phone, facsimile,   
e-mail or by any other electronic means or overnight courier service). We also  
reserve the right to implement and administer redemption fees imposed by one or 
more of the portfolios in the future. Without limiting the generality of the    
forgoing, We do not intend to apply these frequent trading detection methods or 
restrictions to the Rydex VT investment divisions because these investment      
divisions are designed for frequent transfers. See the prospectuses for these   
portfolios for more information.                                                

Contract owners seeking to engage in frequent, programmed, large, or short-term 
transfer activity may deploy a variety of strategies to avoid detection. Our    
ability to detect and deter such transfer activity is limited by operational    
systems and technological limitations. In addition, the terms of the contract   
may also limit Our ability to restrict or deter harmful transfers. Furthermore, 
the identification of contract owners determined to be engaged in transfer      
activity that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolios'         
shareholders involves judgments that are inherently subjective. Accordingly,    
despite Our best efforts, We cannot guarantee that Our market timing procedures 
will detect every potential market timer. Some market timers may get through our
controls undetected and may cause dilution in unit values for others. We apply  
Our market timing procedures consistently to all contract owners without special
arrangement, waiver, or exception. We may vary Our market timing procedures     
among Our other variable insurance products to account for differences in       
various factors, such as operational systems and contract provisions. In        
addition, because other insurance companies and/or retirement plans may invest  
in the portfolios, We cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not suffer harm 
from frequent, programmed, large, or short-term transfers among investment      
divisions of variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among    
investment options available to retirement plan participants.                   

SURRENDERS 

You may withdraw all or part of Your surrender value by sending Us a written    
request at Our Principal Office. The surrender value is the Separate Account    
accumulation value less non-vested premium bonus (if any), minus any applicable 
surrender charges and annual maintenance fee. In some states a premium tax      
charge may also be deducted. (Surrenders may be restricted by a retirement plan 
under which You are covered.) Partial surrenders from an investment division    
must be made in amounts of $500 or more (except for systematic withdrawals      
described below) and cannot reduce Your accumulation value to less than $500. If
a partial surrender results in less than $500 remaining, then the entire        
accumulation value must be withdrawn. For a full surrender, You must send in    
Your contract with Your surrender request.                                      

Any applicable surrender charge, non-vested premium bonus (if any), and any     
required tax withholding will be deducted from the amount paid. In addition,    
upon full surrender an annual maintenance fee (and possibly a premium tax       
charge) may be subtracted.                                                      

Completed surrender requests received at Our Principal Office are priced at the 
next available accumulation unit value. See "Transaction Cut-Off Times" on page 
51                                                                              

We will generally pay the surrender amount from the Separate Account within     
seven days after We receive a properly completed surrender request in good      
order. We may defer payment for a longer period only when:                      

    o     trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted as defined by
the SEC;                                                
     o     the New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary Weekend
and holiday closing);                                   
o     an emergency exists as defined by the SEC as a result of which
         disposal of the Separate Account's securities or determination of
         the net asset value of each investment division is not reasonably
practicable; or                                         
o     for such other periods as the SEC may by order permit for the 
protection of owners.                                   

See "When We Pay Proceeds From This Contract" on page 78.                       

If We defer payment for 30 or more days, then during the period of deferment, We
will pay interest at the rate required by the jurisdiction in which this        
contract is delivered.                                                          

Unless You specify otherwise, Your partial surrender will be allocated among all
investment divisions in the same proportion as Your accumulation value bears to 
each investment division. This allocation is subject to minimum amount          
requirements.                                                                   

The surrender charge will be determined without reference to the source (the    
investment division) of the partial surrender. The charge will be based on the  
length of time between premium payments and surrenders. (See "Surrender Charges
on Surrenders" on page 61.)                                                     

A surrender will generally have Federal income tax consequences that can include
income tax penalties and tax withholding. You should consult Your tax advisor   
before making a surrender. (See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 66.)               

Surrenders may be restored under certain types of qualified contracts. If       
allowed, the restoration will be effective as of the date that surrender        
proceeds are returned to Midland National.                                      

Under certain types of retirement arrangements, the Retirement Equity Act of    
1984 provides that, in the case of a married participant, a surrender request   
must include the consent of the participant's spouse. This consent must contain 
the participant's signature and the notarized or properly witnessed signature of
the participant's spouse. These spousal consent requirements generally apply to 
married participants in most qualified pension plans, including plans for       
self-employed individuals that are considered employee pension benefit plans    
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). You should   
check the terms of Your retirement plan and consult with a tax advisor before   
making a surrender. (See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 66.)                      

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING 

Generally, the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) program enables You to make monthly  
or quarterly transfers of a predetermined dollar amount from the DCA source     
account (any investment division) into one or more of the investment divisions. 

The DCA program may reduce the impact of market fluctuations by allocating      
monthly or quarterly, as opposed to allocating the total amount at one time.    
Since We transfer the same dollar amount to Investment Divisions each month or  
quarter, more units of an Investment Division are purchased if the value of its 
unit is low and fewer units are purchased if the value of its unit is high.     
Therefore, a lower than average value per unit may be achieved over the long    
term. However, We cannot guarantee this. This plan of investing does not insure 
a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets, and You should consider
Your tolerance for investing through periods of fluctuating price levels. The   
minimum monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred using DCA is $200.        

You can elect the DCA program at any time. You must complete the proper request 
forms and send them to Our Principal Office, and there must be a sufficient     
amount in the DCA source account. You can get a sufficient amount by paying a   
premium with the DCA request form, allocating premiums, or transferring amounts 
to the DCA source account. Copies of the DCA request form can be obtained by    
contacting Us at Our Principal Office. The DCA election will specify:           

o     the DCA source account from which transfers will be made,     
    o     that any money received with the form is to be placed into the DCA
source account,                                         
      o     the total monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred to the other
investment divisions, and                               
   o     how that monthly or quarterly amount is to be allocated among the
investment divisions.                                   

The DCA request form must be received with any premium payment You intend to    
apply to DCA. Once You elect DCA, additional net premiums can be allocated into 
the DCA source account by sending them in with a DCA request form. All amounts  
in the DCA source account will be available for transfer under the DCA program. 

Any net premium payments received while the DCA program is in effect will be    
allocated using the allocation percentages from the DCA request form, unless You
specify otherwise. You may change the DCA allocation percentages or DCA transfer
amounts twice during a contract year.                                           

If it is requested when the contract is issued, then DCA will start at the      
beginning of the second contract month. If it is requested after issue, then DCA
will start at the beginning of the next contract month after the request is     
received. DCA will not begin until the end of the free look period.             

DCA automatically terminates on the maturity date.                              

You may stop the DCA program at any time by sending Us written notice. We       
reserve the right to modify, suspend, or end the DCA program by sending You one 
month's written notice. We may in the future offer additional Investment        
Divisions or withdraw any Investment Division from the Dollar Cost Averaging    
program.                                                                        

We do not charge any specific fees for You to participate in a DCA program.     

PORTFOLIO REBALANCING 

The Portfolio Rebalancing option allows contract owners, who are not Dollar Cost
Averaging, to have Us automatically reset the percentage of accumulation value  
allocated to each investment division to a pre-set percentage level on a        
monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The Portfolio Rebalancing     
option is subject to the transfer limitations. Portfolio Rebalancing will not   
occur during the Free Look period. If You elect this option, then on the date of
each month or quarter that is the same as Your contract anniversary date, We    
will transfer the amounts needed to "rebalance" the accumulation value to Your  
specified percentages. Rebalancing may result in transferring amounts from an   
investment division earning a relatively high return to one earning a relatively
low return.                                                                     

Portfolio Rebalancing will remain in effect until We receive Your written       
termination request. We reserve the right to end the Portfolio Rebalancing      
option by sending You one month's notice. Contact Us at Our Principal Office to 
elect the Portfolio Rebalancing option.                                         

There is no charge for Portfolio Rebalancing.                                   

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWALS 

The Systematic Withdrawal feature allows You to have a portion of the           
accumulation value withdrawn automatically. These payments can be made only: (1)
while the annuitant or owner is living, (2) before the maturity date, and (3)   
after the Free Look period. You may elect this option by sending a properly     
completed Preauthorized Systematic Withdrawal Request Form to Our Principal     
Office. You may designate the systematic withdrawal amount or the period for    
systematic withdrawal payments. You will also designate the desired frequency of
the systematic withdrawals, which may be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or   
annually. See Your contract for details on systematic withdrawal options and    
when each begins.                                                               

If the New York Stock Exchange is closed for regular trading on the day when the
withdrawal is to be made, then We will process Your withdrawal at the unit value
determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the New York     
Stock Exchange. The deduction caused by the systematic withdrawal will be       
allocated proportionately to Your accumulation value in the investment          
divisions.                                                                      

You can stop or modify the systematic withdrawals by sending Us a written       
request. A proper written request must include the consent of any effective     
assignee or irrevocable beneficiary, if applicable.                             

Each systematic withdrawal must be at least $200. Each request for withdrawal of
amounts less than $200 will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the 
right to change the frequency of payments or discontinue payments if the payment
is less than $200. Upon payment, We reduce Your accumulation value by an amount 
equal to the payment proceeds plus any applicable surrender charge. (See        
"Surrender Charges on Surrenders" on page 61). The surrender charge applies to  
systematic withdrawals in excess of the free surrender amount in the same manner
as it applies to other partial surrenders. The Extra Credit Rider vesting       
schedule also applies.                                                          

By current Company practice, systematic withdrawals taken to satisfy IRS        
required minimum surrenders and paid under a life expectancy option will not be 
subject to a surrender charge. We reserve the right to change this practice in  
the future. However, if Your contract is issued while this company practice is  
in effect, We guarantee that You will receive this company practice for the life
of Your contract. Amounts withdrawn to comply with IRS minimum distribution     
rules will reduce the amount available under the free surrender amount. Any     
systematic withdrawal that would equal or exceed the surrender value will be    
treated as a complete surrender. In no event will the payment of a systematic   
withdrawal exceed the surrender value. The contract will automatically terminate
if a systematic withdrawal causes the contract's surrender value to equal zero. 
(See the "Five for Life Plus Rider " on page 38 and "GMIB Plus (Guaranteed
Minimum Income and Accumulation Benefit) Rider" on page 43 for additional       
information on withdrawals in excess of any guaranteed amounts.)                

To the extent, if any, that there is gain in the contract, systematic           
withdrawals generally are included in the contract owner's gross income for tax 
purposes (as ordinary income) in the year in which the withdrawal occurs, and   
may be subject to a penalty tax of 10% before age 59 1/2. Additional terms and  
conditions for the systematic withdrawal program are set forth in Your contract 
and in the application for the program.                                         

FREE SURRENDER AMOUNT 

You may withdraw up to 10% of Your accumulation value as of the most recent     
contract anniversary each contract year without incurring a surrender charge in 
each contract year. In the first year, the free surrender amount will be 10% of 
Your initial premium. Generally, if this option is not exercised or if less than
10% is withdrawn, any unused amount will not be carried over to a subsequent    
contract year. A withdrawal may have Federal income tax consequences that can   
include income tax penalties and tax withholding. (See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on  
page 66.) If You have elected the optional Five for Life Plus Rider and the GPA 
or LPA exceeds the 10% free surrender amount, the entire GPA or LPA will be     
penalty free.                                                                   

Waiver of Surrender Charges for Nursing Home Confinement Rider                  
This rider will be attached to all contracts issued to annuitants aged 75 or    
less at no additional charge. After the first contract year, We guarantee that  
this rider will increase the annual free surrender amount available under this  
contract from 10% of Your accumulation value to 20% if the annuitant is confined
to a qualified nursing care center for a period of at least 90 days providing   
that the confinement is medically necessary. If there are joint annuitants, this
Rider may be exercised once for either the first or second annuitant to become  
confined to a qualified nursing care center, but not for both.                  

Qualified nursing care centers are defined in the rider attached to Your        
contract. We will require proof of confinement prior to authorizing this        
benefit.                                                                        

This rider will terminate immediately upon the earliest of:                     

o     Exercising the benefit for a covered annuitant;               
o     Termination of the base annuity;                              
o     Maturity of the base annuity;                                 
   o     The date We receive Your written notice requesting termination of
the rider; or                                           
     o     Death of the annuitant or an owner unless the contract is continued
      under a spousal continuance option and this rider has not been
            previously exercised. Spousal continuance allows a surviving owner's
         spouse, if named the beneficiary of the base annuity contract, to
continue the contract as the new owner.                 

DEATH BENEFIT 

If the annuitant or an owner dies before the maturity date and while the        
contract is still inforce, We will pay the death benefit to the beneficiary once
We receive (at Our Principal Office) satisfactory proof of the annuitant's or   
owner's death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid, and any other
documents or forms required. Once You choose a Death Benefit, You cannot change 
it.                                                                             

If the annuitant, who is not an owner, dies prior to the maturity date, the     
death benefit must be paid within one year of the annuitant's death. For joint  
annuitants the death benefit is paid upon the second death.                     

If an owner dies prior to the maturity date, then the death benefit must be paid
within 5 years of the owner's death (other than amounts payable to, or for the  
benefit of, the surviving spouse of the owner). For joint owners the death      
benefit is paid upon the first death.                                           

The value of the death benefit, as described below, will be determined based on 
the accumulation value on the business day that Our Principal Office receives   
proof of death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other
documents or forms required.                                                    

Unless a payment option is selected and all other required forms and            
documentation are received within 90 days after We receive proof of death, the  
death benefit will be paid as a lump sum calculated as of that date.            

When a death benefit is paid on the death of the annuitant and a payment option 
is selected within 60 days after the annuitant's death, the payment option must 
be an annuity for the life of the payee or for a period extending no longer than
the payee's life expectancy, and payments must begin within one year of the date
of death.                                                                       

When a death benefit is paid on the death of an owner or a joint owner and a    
payment option is selected, the payment option must be an annuity for the life  
of the payee or for a period extending no longer than the payee's life          
expectancy, and payments must begin within one year of the date of death.       

If the annuitant or an owner dies on or after the maturity date, then any       
remaining amounts, other than amounts payable to, or for the benefit of, the    
owner's surviving spouse, must be paid at least as rapidly as the benefits Were 
being paid at the time of the annuitant's or owner's death. Other rules relating
to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts.                         

If joint owners or joint annuitants die within 24 hours of one another, they are
considered to have died simultaneously and the eldest is presumed to have died  
first. In the event of simultaneous death of the owner and an annuitant, the    
owner is presumed to have died first, and the owner's beneficiary would be paid 
the death benefit.                                                              

If the oldest annuitant or an owner is less than age 81 at the time of issue,   
the death benefit paid to the beneficiary will be the greatest of:              

1.    the accumulation value when We receive due proof of death, an 
     election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other
documentation or forms required; or                     
2.    100% of the total premium payments made to Your contract minus
   adjustments for partial surrenders. Adjustments for partial
            surrenders will reduce the death benefit in the same proportion that
           the partial surrender reduced the accumulation value at the time of
the partial surrender.                                  

If the oldest annuitant or owner is age 81 or older at the time of issue, the   
death benefit paid to the beneficiary will be the accumulation value when We    
receive due proof of death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid  
and any other required documentation or forms.                                  

If the annuitant or an owner dies on or after the maturity date, We will pay any
remaining amounts, other than amounts payable to or for the benefit of the      
owner's surviving spouse at least as rapidly as the benefits Were being paid at 
the time of the annuitant's or owner's death. Other rules relating to           
distributions at death apply to qualified contracts. death. Other rules relating
to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts.                         

Naming different persons as owner and annuitant can affect whether the death    
benefit is payable, the amount of the benefit, and who will receive it. Use care
when naming owners, annuitants, and beneficiaries, and consult Your registered  
representative if You have questions.                                           

Premium taxes may be deducted from the death benefit proceeds and We may retain 
any non-vested portion of the premium bonus.                                    

PAYMENT OF DEATH BENEFITS 

In most cases, when a death benefit is paid in a lump sum, We will pay the death
benefit by establishing an interest bearing account, called the "Midland Access 
Account" for the beneficiary, in the amount of the death benefit. We will send  
the beneficiary a checkbook, and the beneficiary will have access to the account
simply by writing a check for all or any part of the amount of the death        
benefit. The Midland Access Account is part of Our fixed account. It is not a   
bank account and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency.  
As part of Our fixed account, it is subject to the claims of Our creditors. We  
receive a benefit from all amounts left in the Midland Access Account.          

CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS

SURRENDER CHARGES ON SURRENDERS 

We may deduct a surrender charge from any full or partial surrender (including a
surrender to effect an annuity and on systematic withdrawals) that exceeds the  
free surrender amount. This charge partially reimburses Us for the selling and  
distributing costs of this contract. These include commissions and the costs of 
preparing sales literature and printing prospectuses. If the surrender charge is
insufficient to cover all distribution expenses, then the deficiency will be met
from Our surplus that may be, in part, derived from mortality and expense risks 
charges (described below). For the purpose of determining the surrender charge, 
any amount that You withdraw will be treated as being from premiums first, and  
then from investment income, if any (and without regard to allocations of       
premiums or surrenders among investment divisions). Premium payments are        
considered withdrawn in the order that they Were received. There is no surrender
charge on the investment earnings (if any) withdrawn. If You have elected the   
optional Five for Life Plus Rider and the GPA or LPA exceeds the 10% free       
surrender amount, the entire GPA or LPA will be penalty free.                   

The length of time between each premium payment and surrender determines the    
amount of the surrender charge.                                                 

The charge is a percentage of the premiums withdrawn and equals:

1                          7%                 
2                          7%                 
3                          6%                 
4                          5%                 
5                          4%                 
6                          3%                 
7                          2%                 
8+                         0%                 

At the time of withdrawal, if Your accumulation value is less than Your net     
premium, the surrender charge will still be assessed against the full remaining 
net premium amount. See "Surrender Charge" on page 19.                          

Under Midland National's current Company practice, amounts withdrawn under the  
contract to comply with IRS minimum distribution rules and paid under a life    
expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge. We reserve the     
right to change this practice in the future. However, if Your contract is issued
while this company practice is in effect, We guarantee that You will receive    
this company practice for the life of Your contract. Amounts withdrawn to comply
with IRS minimum distribution rules will reduce the amount available under the  
free surrender amount.                                                          

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE 

We deduct a daily charge for mortality and expense risks at an effective annual 
rate that ranges from 1.20% up to 1.45% of the accumulation values in the       
Separate Account. The amount of this charge is based on the accumulation value. 
If Your accumulation value is less than $25,000, the mortality and expense risk 
charge is 1.45% of the accumulation value. If Your accumulation value is equal  
to or greater than $25,000 but less than $100,000, the mortality and expense    
risk charge is 1.30% of the accumulation value. If Your accumulation value is   
$100,000 or more, the mortality and expense risk charge is 1.20% of the         
accumulation value. There are economies of scale with higher accumulation values
(expenses per policy dampen as a percentage of accumulation value). This economy
of scale is passed onto You by having a different charge based on the level of  
accumulation value.                                                             

At the beginning of each contract month, the mortality and expense risk charge  
will be determined. Therefore, the mortality and expense risk charge may vary   
from month to month depending on the accumulation value determined at the       
beginning of each contract month but is guaranteed never to be more than 1.45%  
on the base contract.                                                           

This charge compensates Us for assuming certain mortality and expense risks and 
for certain expenses. The investment division's accumulation unit values and    
annuity unit values reflect this charge. We expect to profit from this charge.  
We may use the profit for any purpose, including paying distribution expenses.  
However, the maximum range of this charge (1.20% to 1.45%) is guaranteed for the
life of the contract and may not be increased. We will continue to deduct this  
charge after the maturity date if You select a variable annuity option.         

The mortality risk We bear arises, in part, from our obligation to make monthly 
annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual may    
live. These payments are guaranteed in accordance with the annuity tables and   
other provisions contained in Your contract. This assures You that neither the  
longevity of the annuitant, nor an unanticipated improvement in general life    
expectancy, will have any adverse effect on the monthly annuity payments the    
annuitant will receive under the contract. Our obligation, therefore, relieves  
the annuitant from the risk that he or she will outlive the funds accumulated   
for retirement. The mortality risk also arises, in part, because of the risk    
that the death benefit may be greater than the accumulation value. We also      
assume the risk that other expense charges may be insufficient to cover the     
actual expenses We incur. We may also use proceeds from this charge to cover    
distribution expenses and payments to third parties who provide advisory or     
other services to contract owners.                                              

ADMINISTRATION FEE 

We deduct a daily administration fee equal to an annual percentage rate of each 
investment division's average daily net assets. The purpose of this charge is to
compensate Us for the expenses associated with administration of the contract   
and operation of the investment divisions and other expenses. The administration
fee can vary by investment division. The current administration fee for all     
investment divisions is 0.45%.. If Your contract is issued with the 0.45%       
administration fee, We guarantee that this fee will not change for the life of  
Your contract.                                                                  

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE 

We deduct an annual maintenance fee of $30 on each contract anniversary on or   
before the maturity date. We reserve the right to increase this charge, however,
it will not exceed $60 per contract year. However, if Your contract is issued   
while the $30 fee is in effect, We guarantee that the annual maintenance fee    
each contract year will not be more than $30 for the life of Your contract. We  
waive the annual maintenance fee if Your accumulation value is $50,000 or more  
on the contract anniversary. This charge is for Our record keeping and other    
expenses incurred in maintaining the contracts. At the end of each contract year
We deduct this charge proportionally from each investment division. If the      
contract is surrendered during a contract year and the accumulation value is    
less than $50,000, then We will deduct the full annual maintenance fee for the  
current contract year at that time. We will not deduct the annual maintenance   
fee in the event of annuitization or death.                                     

We may reduce the annual maintenance fee for contracts issued in a manner that  
results in a savings of administrative expenses. The amount of reductions will  
be considered on a case-by-case basis and reflect Our expected reductions in    
administrative expenses.

deducts such charges from contracts issued in the states of South Dakota,       
Wyoming, Maine, and West Virginia. These states and jurisdictions are subject to
change.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

INTRODUCTION 

NOTE: We have prepared the following information on federal income taxes as a   
general discussion of the subject. It is not intended as tax advice to any      
individual. You should consult with and rely on Your own tax advisor about Your 
own circumstances. We have included an additional discussion regarding taxes in 
the SAI.                                                                        

ANNUITY CONTRACTS IN GENERAL 

Deferred annuities are a way of setting aside money for future needs like       
retirement. Congress recognized how important saving for retirement is and      
provided special rules in the Internal Revenue Code for annuities.              

Simply stated, these rules provide that generally You will not be taxed on the  
gain, if any, on the money held in Your annuity contract until You take the     
money out. This is referred to as tax deferral. There are different rules as to 
how You will be taxed depending on how You take the money out and the type of   
contract - qualified or non-qualified (discussed below).                        

You will generally not be taxed on increases in the value of Your contract until
a distribution occurs - either as a surrender or as annuity payments.           

When a non-natural person (e.g., corporation or certain other entities other    
than tax-qualified trusts) owns a non-qualified contract, the contract will     
generally not be treated as an annuity for tax purposes and any increase in the 
excess of the amount value over the investment in the contract during the       
taxable year must generally be included in income.There are some exceptions to  
this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person should discuss   
these with a tax advisor.                                                       

Qualified and Non-Qualified Contracts                                           
If You invest in a variable annuity as part of an individual retirement plan,   
pension plan or employer-sponsored retirement program, Your contract is called a
Qualified Contract. If Your annuity is independent of any formal retirement or  
pension plan, it is termed a Non-Qualified Contract. The tax rules applicable to
qualified contracts vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms 
and conditions of the plan.                                                     

Qualified contracts are issued in connection with the plans listed below. There 
is additional information about qualified contracts in the SAI.                 

o     Individual Retirement Annuity (IRA): A traditional IRA allows 
          individuals to make contributions, which may be deductible, to the
contract.                                               
 o     A Roth IRA also allows individuals to make contributions to the
          contract, but it does not allow a deduction for contributions, and
       distributions may be tax-free if the owner meets certain rules.
      o     Corporate Pension and Profit-Sharing and H.R. 10 Plan: Employers and
        self-employed individuals can establish pension orprofit-sharing
         plans for their employees or themselves and make contributions to
the contract on a pre-tax basis.                        
 o     Deferred Compensation Plan (457 Plan): Certain governmental and
          tax-exempt organization can establish a plan to defer compensation
           on behalf of their employees through contributions to the contract.
   o     Under Code section 403(b), payments made by public school systems
          and certain tax exempt organizations to purchase annuity contracts
       for their employees are excludable from the gross income of the
         employee, subject to certain limitations. However, these payments
            may be subject to FICA (Social Security) taxes. A qualified contract
      issued as a tax-sheltered annuity under section 403(b) will be
        amended as necessary to conform to the requirements of the Code.
     Code section 403(b)(11) restricts the distribution under Code
section 403(b) annuity contracts of:                    

           1.    elective contributions made in years beginning after December
31, 1988;                                   
2.    earnings on those contributions; and              
        3.    earnings in such years on amounts held as of the last year
beginning before January 1, 1989.           

      Distribution of those amounts may only occur upon death of the
      employee, attainment of age 59 1/2, disability, severance from
    employment, or hardship. In addition, income attributable to
    elective contributions may not be distributed in the case of
hardship.                                               

The contract contains death benefit features that in some cases may exceed the  
greater of the net premium payments or the accumulation value. These death      
benefit features could be characterized as an incidental benefit, the amount of 
which is limited in any pension, profit-sharing plan, or 403(b) plan. Because   
the death benefit may exceed this limitation and its value may need to be       
considered in calculating minimum required distributions, employers using the   
contract in connection with such plans should consult their tax advisor. The    
Internal Revenue Service has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an  
IRA, and has not addressed in a ruling of general applicability whether a death 
benefit provision such as the provisions in the contract comports with IRA      
qualification requirements.                                                     

Minimum Distribution Rules and Eligible Rollover Distributions                  
Qualified contracts have minimum distribution rules that govern the timing and  
amount of distributions. If You are attempting to satisfy these rules before the
maturity date, the value of any enhanced death benefit or other optional rider  
may need to be included in calculating the amount required to be distributed.   
Consult with and rely upon Your tax advisor. In addition, the income for a      
specified period option may not always satisfy minimum required distribution    
rules. Consult with and rely upon Your tax advisor before electing this option. 
If Your minimum required distribution amount exceeds Your payment amount under  
the Five for Life Plus Rider, You will have to withdraw more than the payment   
amount to avoid the imposition of a 50% excise tax, causing a decrease in Your  
guaranteed amount. You should consult with and rely upon Your tax advisor before
purchasing the Five for Life Plus Rider with a qualified contract.              

Distributions before age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. Also,      
distributions from qualified contracts are generally subject to withholding.    
"Eligible rollover distributions" from corporate pension, profit-sharing and    
H.R. 10 plans, 403(b) plans, and governmental 457 plans are subject to a        
mandatory federal income tax withholding of 20%. An eligible rollover           
distribution is any distribution to an employee (or employee's spouse or former 
spouse as beneficiary or alternate payee) from such a plan, except certain      
distributions such as distributions required by the Code, distributions in a    
specified annuity form, or hardship distributions. The 20% withholding does not 
apply, however, to certain nontaxable distributions or if the employee chooses a
"direct rollover" from the plan to a tax-qualified plan, IRA, or tax sheltered  
annuity or to a governmental 457 plan that agrees to separately account for     
rollover contributions.                                                         

Diversification and Distribution Requirements                                   
The Internal Revenue Code provides that the underlying investments for a        
non-qualified variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements
in order to be treated as an annuity. The annuity must also meet certain        
distribution requirements at the death of the annuitant or an owner in order to 
be treated as an annuity contract. These diversification and distribution       
requirements are discussed in the SAI. Midland may modify the contract to       
attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment.                                    

Owner Control                                                                   
In certain circumstances, owners of variable annuity contracts have been        
considered for Federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the
Separate Account supporting their contracts due to their ability to exercise    
investment control over those assets. When this is the case, the contract owners
have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to the variable      
account assets. There is limited guidance in this area, and some features of Our
contracts, such as the flexibility of an Owner to allocate premium payments and 
transfer amounts among the investment divisions of the Separate Account, have   
not been explicitly addressed in published rulings. While We believe that the   
contracts do not give Owners investment control over Separate Account assets, We
reserve the right to modify the contracts as necessary to prevent an Owner from 
being treated as the Owner of the Separate Account assets supporting the        
contract.                                                                       

Required Distributions at Death (Non-Qualified Contracts)                       
In order to be treated as an annuity contract for Federal income tax purposes,  
Section 72(s) of the Code requires any non-qualified contract to contain certain
provisions specifying how Your interest in the contract will be distributed in  
the event of the death of an owner of the contract, or the annuitant if the     
contract has a non-natural Owner. Section 72(s) generally requires that (a) if  
any owner dies on or after the annuity starting date, but prior to the time the 
entire interest has distributed, the entire interest in the contract will be    
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used  
as of the date of such owner's death; and (b) if any owner dies prior to the    
annuity starting date, the entire interest in the contract will be distributed  
within five years after the date of such owner's death. These requirements will 
be considered satisfied if amounts are payable to or for the benefit of a       
designated beneficiary and are paid over the life of such designated beneficiary
or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary,  
provided that such distributions begin within one year of the owner's death. If 
the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the deceased owner, the   
contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as the new owner.           

Surrenders - Non-Qualified Contracts                                            
If You purchase the contract as an individual and not under an individual       
retirement annuity, or other qualified retirement plan, Your contract is        
referred to as a non-qualified contract.                                        

If You make a partial surrender from a non-qualified contract before the annuity
commencement date, the Internal Revenue Code treats that surrender as first     
coming from gain and then from Your premium payments. When You make a partial   
surrender You are taxed on the amount of the surrender that is gain. If You make
a full surrender, You are generally taxed on the amount that Your surrender     
proceeds exceed the "investment in the contract," which is generally Your       
premiums paid (adjusted for any prior partial surrenders that came out of the   
premiums). The premium bonus will generally be considered gain. The method for  
computing gain where a Five for Life Plus Rider or a GMIB Plus Rider is added to
Your contract is unclear. Accordingly, You should consult a tax adviser before  
adding either of these riders. Different rules apply for annuity payments. See  
"Annuity Payments" below.                                                       

The Internal Revenue Code also provides that surrendered gain may be subject to 
a penalty. The amount of the penalty is equal to 10% of the amount that is      
includable in income. Some surrenders will be exempt from the penalty. In       
general this includes any amount:                                               

o     paid on or after the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2; 
o     paid after an owner dies;                         
            o     paid if the taxpayer becomes totally disabled (as that term is
defined in the Internal Revenue Code);      
            o     paid in a series of substantially equal payments made annually
  (or more frequently) under a lifetime annuity;
o     paid under an immediate annuity; or               
            o     which come from premium payments made prior to August 14, 1982
(Pre-TEFRA).                                

Special rules may be applicable in connection with the exceptions enumerated    
above. You should consult with and rely on Your tax advisor with regard to      
exceptions from the penalty tax.                                                

Multiple Contracts                                                              
All non-qualified deferred contracts that are issued by Midland National (or its
affiliates) to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one       
annuity for purposes of determining the amount includable in the owner's income 
when a taxable distribution occurs.                                             

Withholding                                                                     
Distributions, from qualified and non-qualified contracts, are generally subject
to withholding for Your federal income tax liability. The withholding rate      
varies according to the type of distribution and Your tax status. Except with   
respect to eligible rollover distributions, as described above, You will be     
provided the opportunity to elect not to have tax withheld from distributions   
when allowed by law.                                                            

Annuity Payments                                                                
Although the tax consequences may vary depending on the annuity payment option  
You select, in general, for non-qualified and certain qualified contracts, only 
a portion of the annuity payments You receive will be includable in Your gross  
income.                                                                         

In general, the excludable portion of each annuity payment You receive will be  
determined as follows:                                                          

           o     Fixed payments - by dividing the "investment in the contract"
           on the maturity date by the total expected value of the
              annuity payments for the term of the payments. This is the
          percentage of each annuity payment that is excludable.
    o     Variable payments - by dividing the "investment in the
                  contract" on the maturity date by the total number of expected
                 periodic payments. This is the amount of each annuity payment
that is excludable.                         

The remainder of each annuity payment is includable in gross income. Once the   
"investment in the contract" has been fully recovered, the full amount of any   
additional annuity payments is includable in gross income.                      

If You select more than one annuity payment option, special rules govern the    
allocation of the contract's entire "investment in the contract" to each such   
option, for purposes of determining the excludable amount of each payment       
received under that option. We advise You to consult a competent tax advisor as 
to the potential tax effects of allocation amounts to any particular annuity    
payment option.                                                                 

If, after annuitization, annuity payments stop because the annuitant or an owner
has died, the excess (if any) of the "investment in the contract" as of the     
annuitization date over the aggregate amount of annuity payments received that  
was excluded from gross income is generally allowable as a deduction for Your   
last taxable year.                                                              

Annuity Contracts Purchased by Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations      
The discussion above provided general information regarding U.S. federal income 
tax consequences to annuity owners that are U.S. persons. Taxable distributions 
made to owners who are not U.S. persons will generally be subject to U.S.       
federal income tax withholding at a 30% rate, unless a lower treaty rate        
applies. In addition, distributions may be subject to state and/or municipal    
taxes and taxes that may be imposed by the owner's country of citizenship or    
residence. Prospective foreign owners are advised to consult with a qualified   
tax advisor regarding U.S., state, and foreign taxation for any annuity contract
purchase.                                                                       

Taxation of Death benefit Proceeds                                              
Amounts may be distributed from the contract because of the death of the        
annuitant or an owner. Generally, such amounts should be includable in the      
income of the recipient:                                                        

          o     if distributed in a lump sum, these amounts are taxed in the
same manner as a full surrender; or         
           o     if distributed under an annuity payment option, these amounts
     are taxed in the same manner as annuity payments.

Transfers, Assignments or Exchange of Contracts                                 
A transfer of ownership or absolute assignment of a contract, the designation of
an annuitant or payee or other beneficiary who is not also the owner, the       
selection of certain maturity dates, or a change of annuitant, may result in    
certain income or gift tax consequences to the owner that are beyond the scope  
of this discussion. An owner contemplating any such transfer, assignment,       
selection, or change should contact a competent tax advisor with respect to the 
potential tax effects of such a transaction.                                    

Possible Tax Law Changes                                                        
Although the likelihood of legislative changes is uncertain, there is always the
possibility that the tax treatment of the contract could change by legislation  
or otherwise. You should consult a tax advisor with respect to legal            
developments and their effect on the contract.                                  

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001                       
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA") repeals
the federal estate tax and replaces it with a carryover basis income tax regime 
effective for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2009. EGTRRA also   
repeals the generation skipping transfer tax, but not the gift tax, for         
transfers made after December 31, 2009. EGTRRA contains a sunset provision,     
which essentially returns the federal estate, gift and generation-skipping      
transfer taxes to their pre-EGTRRA form, beginning in 2011. Congress may or may 
not enact permanent repeal between now and then.                                

During the period prior to 2010, EGTRRA provides for periodic decreases in the  
maximum estate tax rate coupled with periodic increases in the estate tax       
exemption. For 2006, the maximum estate tax rate is 46% and the estate tax      
exemption is $2,000,000.                                                        

The complexity of the new tax law, along with uncertainty as to how it might be 
modified in coming years, underscores the importance of seeking guidance from a 
qualified advisor to help ensure that Your estate plan adequately addresses Your
needs and that of Your beneficiaries under all possible scenarios. While no     
attempt is being made to discuss the Federal estate tax implications of the     
contract, a purchaser should keep in mind that the value of an annuity contract 
owned by a decedent and payable to a beneficiary by virtue of surviving the     
decedent is included in the decedent's gross estate. Depending on the terms of  
the annuity contract, the value of the annuity included in the gross estate may 
be the value of the lump sum payment payable to the designated beneficiary or   
the actuarial value of the payments to be received by the beneficiary. Consult  
with and rely on an estate planning advisor for more information.               

Under certain circumstances, the Code may impose a "generation-skipping transfer
tax" when all or part of an annuity contract is transferred to, or a death      
benefit is paid to, an individual two or more generations Younger than the      
owner. Regulations issued under the Code may require Us to deduct the tax from  
Your contract, or from any applicable payment, and pay it directly to the IRS.  

Separate Account Charges                                                        
It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may take a position that fees  
for certain optional benefits are deemed to be taxable distributions to You.    
Although We do not believe that the fees associated with any optional benefit   
provided under the contract should be treated as taxable surrenders, You should 
consult Your tax advisor prior to selecting any optional benefit under the      
contract.                                                                       

Annuity Purchases by Residents of Puerto Rico                                   

The Internal Revenue Service recently announced that income received by         
residents of Puerto Rico under life insurance or annuity contracts issued by a  
Puerto Rico branch of a United States life insurance company is U.S.-source     
income that is generally subject to United States Federal income tax.           

MATURITY DATE 

The maturity date is the last possible date on which income payments will begin 
under the annuity option You have selected. The earliest possible maturity date 
under the contract is the 7th contract anniversary at which time You may        
annuitize Your full accumulation value (less any premium taxes). However, by    
current company practice, We will allow You to annuitize the accumulation value 
(less any non-vested extra credit and less any premium taxes), after the 3rd    
contract year, if You choose a life annuity or joint and survivor income annuity
payment options, and after the 5th contract year if at least a five-year certain
period annuity option is elected. Benefits are not guaranteed and are subject to
change. However, if Your contract is issued while this company practice is in   
effect, We guarantee that You will receive this company practice for the life of
Your contract. The maximum maturity date is the contract anniversary immediately
following the annuitant's 100th birthday. You may change the maturity date by   
sending written notice to Our Principal Office. We must receive Your written    
notice at least 30 days prior to the original maturity date.                    

If You have not previously specified otherwise and have not elected certain     
systematic withdrawal options, then on the maturity date You may:               

1.    take the accumulation value in one lump sum, or   
           2.    convert the accumulation value into an annuity payable to the
annuitant (payee) as described below.       

Electing  An Annuity Option                                                     
You may apply the proceeds of a surrender to affect an annuity payment option.  
Unless You choose otherwise, on the maturity date, Your surrender value from the
Separate Account will be applied to a 10 year certain and life variable payout. 
The first monthly annuity payment will be made within one month after the       
maturity date. Variable payment options are not available in certain states.    

Currently, the payment options are only available if the proceeds applied are   
$2,500 or more and the first periodic payment will be at least $50. We reserve  
the right to change the payment frequency so that payments are at least $50.    

The payee's actual age will affect each payment amount for annuity payment      
options involving life income. The amount of each annuity payment to older      
payees will be greater than for Younger payees because payments to older payees 
are expected to be fewer in number. For annuity payment options that do not     
involve life annuity, the length of the payment period will affect the amount of
each payment. With a shorter period, the amount of each annuity payment will be 
greater. Payments that occur more frequently will be smaller than those         
occurring less frequently.                                                      

The payee or any other person who is entitled to receive payments may name a    
beneficiary to receive any amount that We would otherwise pay to that person's  
estate if that person died. The person who is entitled to receive payment may   
change the beneficiary at any time.                                             

Annuity payment options will be subject to Our rules at the time of selection.  
We must approve any arrangements that involve more than one of the payment      
options, or a payee who is not a natural person (for example, a corporation), or
a payee who is a fiduciary or an assignee. Also, the details of all arrangements
will be subject to Our rules at the time the arrangements takes effect. This    
includes:                                                                       

      o     rules on the minimum amount We will pay under an option;
    o     minimum amounts for installment payments, surrender or
                  commutation rights (Your rights to receive payments over time,
   for which We may offer You a lump sum payment);
          o     the naming of people who are entitled to receive payment and
their beneficiaries; and                    
o     the ways of proving age, gender, and survival.    

You choose an annuity payment option when You apply for a contract and may      
change it by writing to Our Principal Office. You must elect the payment option 
at least 30 days before the maturity date.                                      

Fixed Payment Options                                                           
Payments under the fixed options are not affected by the investment experience  
of any investment division. If You elect a fixed payment option, then the       
surrender value as of the maturity date will be applied to the fixed option     
selected. We guarantee interest under the fixed options at a rate of 1.50% a    
year. We may also credit interest under the fixed payment options at a rate that
is above the 1.50% guaranteed rate (this is at Our complete discretion).        
Thereafter, interest or payments are fixed according to the annuity option      
chosen.                                                                         

Variable Payment Options                                                        
Payments under the variable options will vary in amount depending on the        
investment experience of the investment divisions after the maturity date.      
Variable payment options are not available in certain states.                   

The annuity tables contained in the contract are based on a 5% (five percent)   
assumed investment rate. This is a fulcrum rate around which variable annuity   
payments will fluctuate to reflect whether the investment experience of the     
investment divisions is better or worse than the assumed investment rate. If the
actual investment experience exceeds the assumed investment rate, then the      
payment will increase. Conversely, if the actual investment experience is less  
than the assumed rate, then payments will decrease.                             

We determine the amount of the first monthly variable payment by applying the   
value in each investment division (as of a date not more than 10 business days  
prior to the maturity date) to the appropriate rate (from the annuity tables in 
the contract) for the payout options selected using the payee's age and sex     
(where permissible). The amount of the first payment will then be used to       
determine the number of annuity units for each investment division. The number  
of annuity units is used to determine the amount of subsequent variable         
payments.                                                                       

The annuity unit value for each investment division will be initially set at    
$10. Thereafter the annuity unit value will vary with the investment experience 
of the investment division and will reflect the mortality and expense risk      
charge We deduct at an effective annual rate based on Your accumulation value at
the time of annuitization (charges for optional riders discontinue after the    
maturity date). If Your accumulation value is less than $25,000, the effective  
annual rate is 1.45%. If Your accumulation value is equal to or greater than    
$25,000 but less than $100,000, the effective annual rate is 1.30%. If Your     
accumulation value is $100,000 or more, the effective annual rate is 1.20%. The 
annuity unit value will increase if the net investment experience (investment   
experience minus the asset charge) is greater than the 5% assumed investment    
rate. The annuity unit value will decrease if the net investment experience is  
less than the 5% assumed investment rate.                                       

The amount of each subsequent variable payment will be determined for each      
investment division by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity   
unit value.                                                                     

Additional information on the variable annuity payments is contained in the SAI 
that can be obtained for free by contacting Us at Our Principal Office.         

Payment Options                                                                 
The following three payment options are available:                              

    1.    Income for Specified Period: We pay installments for a
             specified period. We will pay the amount applied in equal
                 installments plus applicable interest (excess interest may be
                  paid at Our discretion), for a specified time, from 5 up to 20
years. (fixed payment option only)          
          2.    Payment of Life Income: We will pay monthly income for life.
          You may choose from 1 of 2 ways to receive the income:
                  a) Life Annuity: We will pay equal monthly payments during the
              lifetime of the payee. With a life annuity payment option,
             payments will only be made as long as the payee is alive.
              Therefore, if the payee dies after the first payment, then
only one payment will be made.              
                  b) Life Annuity With Certain Period: We will pay equal monthly
              payments for a selected number of guaranteed payments, and
       then for as long as the payee is living thereafter.
            3.    Joint and Survivor Income: We will make monthly payments until
               the last surviving payee's death. Therefore, if both payees
              die after the first payment, then only one payment will be
             made. The annuitant must be at least 50 years old and the
                beneficiary/payee must be at least 45 years old, at the time
of the first monthly payment.               

Transfers after Annuitization for Variable Payment Options                      
After annuitization, only two transfers per contract year may be made among the 
investment divisions.                                                           

Generally, for all investment divisions, transfer requests received in good     
order at Our Principal Office on any business day are priced at the next        
available accumulation unit value. See "Transaction Cut-Off Times" on page 51.  

The transfer request must be received at least 10 business days before the due  
date of the first annuity payment to which the change will apply. Transfers     
after the annuity payments have started will be based on the annuity unit       
values. There will be no transfer charge for this transfer.

Midland National is a subsidiary of Sammons Enterprises, Inc., Dallas, Texas.   
Sammons Enterprises has controlling or substantial stock interests in a large

Our General Account                                                             
Our general account consists of all of Our investment assets that are not       
allocated to separate accounts. The general account supports all of Our         
insurance obligations that are not supported by a separate account including Our
obligations to pay the benefits under this contract offered by the optional     
riders. All contract guarantees, including the optional rider benefits, are

You do not have any interest in Our general account.                            

FUND VOTING RIGHTS 

We invest the assets of Our Separate Account investment divisions in shares of  
the funds' portfolios. Midland is the legal owner of the shares and has the     
right to vote on certain matters. Among other things, We may vote:              

o     to elect the funds' Board of Directors,                       
o     to ratify the selection of independent auditors for the funds,
      o     on any other matters described in the funds' current prospectuses or
            requiring a vote by shareholders under the Investment Company Act of
1940, and                                               
   o     in some cases, to change the investment objectives and contracts.

Even though We own the shares, We may give You the opportunity to tell Us how to
vote the number of shares that are allocated to Your contract.                  

The funds will determine if and how often shareholder meetings are held. As We  
receive notice of these meetings, We will ask for Your voting instructions, to  
the extent required by law. The funds are not required to hold a meeting in any 
given year.                                                                     

If We do not receive instructions in time from all contract owners, then We     
currently intend to vote those shares in the same proportion as We vote shares  
for which We have received instructions in that portfolio. We currently intend  
to vote any Fund shares that We alone are entitled to vote in the same          
proportions that contract owners vote. If the federal securities laws or        
regulations or interpretations of them change so that We are permitted to vote  
shares of the Fund in Our own right or to restrict owner voting, then We may do 
so.                                                                             

How We Determine Your Voting Shares                                             
You may participate in voting only on matters concerning the Fund portfolios in 
which Your accumulation value has been invested. We determine Your voting shares
in each division by dividing the amount of Your accumulation value allocated to 
that division by the net asset value of one share of the corresponding Fund     
portfolio. This is determined as of the record date set by the Fund's Board for 
the shareholders meeting.                                                       

If You have a voting interest, then We will send You proxy material and a form  
for giving Us voting instructions. In certain cases, We may disregard           
instructions relating to changes in the Fund's adviser or the investment        
objectives and policies of its portfolios.                                      

Voting Privileges of Participants In Other Companies                            
Other insurance companies own shares in the funds to support their variable life
insurance and variable annuity products. We do not foresee any disadvantage to  
this. Nevertheless, each Fund's Board of Directors will monitor events to       
identify conflicts that may arise and determine appropriate action. If We       
disagree with any fund action, then We will see that appropriate action is taken
to protect Our contract owners.                                                 

OUR REPORTS TO OWNERS 

Shortly after the end of each calendar year, We will send a report that shows   

o     Your accumulation value, and                                  
  o     Any transactions involving Your accumulation value that occurred
       during the year. Transactions include Your premium allocations,
transfers and partial surrenders made in that year.     

Confirmation notices will be sent to You for premiums, transfers of amounts     
between investment divisions and certain other contract transactions.           

We also currently intend to send You semi-annual reports with financial         
information on the portfolios.                                                  

DIVIDENDS 

We do not pay any dividends on the contract described in this prospectus.       

PERFORMANCE 

Performance information for the investment divisions may appear in reports and  
advertising to current and prospective owners. The performance information is   
based on the average annual total returns for one or more of the investment     
divisions based on the performance of a portfolio since the time the Separate   
Account commenced operations and does not indicate or represent future          
performance.                                                                    

We may also use performance information for the investment divisions in reports 
and advertising to current and prospective owners that is based on the          
historical investment experience of the investment division and the portfolios  
and does not indicate or represent future performance.                          

Total returns are based on the overall dollar or percentage change in value of a
hypothetical investment. Standard total return quotations reflect changes in    
portfolio share price, the automatic reinvestment by the Separate Account of all
distributions and the deduction of applicable charges (including any surrender  
charges that would apply if You surrendered the contract at the end of the      
period indicated). Quotations of total return may also be shown that do not take
into account certain contract charges such as the surrender charge and the rider
charges. The total return percentage will be higher under this method than under
the standard method described above.                                            

A cumulative total return reflects performance over a stated period of time. If 
the performance had been constant over the entire period, then an average annual
total return reflects the hypothetical annually compounded return that would    
have produced the same cumulative total return. Because average annual total    
returns tend to smooth out variations in an investment division's returns, You  
should recognize that they are not the same as actual year-by-year results.     

Some investment divisions may also advertise yield. These measures reflect the  
income generated by an investment in the investment divisions over a specified  
period of time. This income is annualized and shown as a percentage. Yields do  
to not take into account capital gains or losses or the surrender charge or     
rider charges. The standard quotations of yield reflect the annual maintenance  
fee.                                                                            

The money market investment divisions may advertise their current and effective 
yield. Current yield reflects the income generated by an investment in the      
investment division over a 7-day period. Effective yield is calculated in       
similar manner except that income earned is assumed to be reinvested. Other     
investment divisions may advertise a 30-day yield which reflects the income     
generated by an investment in the investment division over a 30-day period.     

We may also advertise performance figures for the investment divisions based on 
the performance of a portfolio prior to the time the Separate Account commenced 
operations.                                                                     

CHANGE OF ADDRESS NOTIFICATION 

To protect You from fraud and theft, We may verify any changes in address You   
request by sending a confirmation of the change of address to both Your old and 
new addresses. We may also call You to verify the change of address.            

MODIFICATION TO YOUR CONTRACT 

Upon notice to You, We may modify Your contract to:                             

1.    permit the contract or the Separate Account to comply with any
   applicable law or regulation issued by a government agency;
      2.    assure continued qualification of the contract under the Tax Code or
       other federal or state laws relating to retirement annuities or
variable annuity contracts;                             
3.    reflect a change in the operation of the Separate Account; or 
4.    provide additional investment options.                        

In the event of such modifications, We may make an appropriate endorsement to   
the contract.                                                                   

YOUR BENEFICIARY 

You name Your beneficiary in Your contract application. The beneficiary is      
entitled to the death benefit of the contract. A beneficiary is revocable unless
otherwise stated in the beneficiary designation. You may change the revocable   
beneficiary during the owner's and annuitant's lifetime. We must receive written
notice informing Us of the change. Upon receipt and acceptance at Our Principal 
Office, a change takes effect as of the date that the written notice was signed.
We will not be liable for any payment made before We receive and accept the     
written notice. If no primary beneficiary is living when the annuitant or an    
owner dies, the death benefit will be paid to the contingent beneficiary, if    
any. If no beneficiary is living when the annuitant or an owner dies, then We   
will pay the death benefit to the owner's or annuitant's estate.                

If there are joint owners, the surviving joint owner, if any, will be considered
the designated primary beneficiary, unless the joint owners have otherwise      
designated a primary beneficiary either on the application or by sending Us a   
written notice. If a person other than a joint owner is named a primary         
beneficiary, the surviving owner will not be entitled to proceeds upon the death
of the first owner.                                                             

ASSIGNING YOUR CONTRACT 

You may assign Your rights in a non-qualified contract. You must send a copy of 
the assignment to Our Principal Office. The assignment takes effect as of the   
date that the written notice was signed. We are not responsible for the validity
of the assignment or for any payment We make or any action We take before We    
record notice of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of          
ownership. There may be tax consequences.                                       

WHEN WE PAY PROCEEDS FROM THIS CONTRACT 

We will generally pay any death benefits, withdrawals, or surrenders within     
seven days after receiving the required information and form(s) at Our Principal
Office. The death benefit is determined as of the date We receive due proof of  
death, an election of a settlement option, and any other required forms or      
documentation. If We do not receive a written election and all other required   
forms within 90 days after receipt of due proof of death, then a lump sum       
payment will be paid as of that date.                                           

We may delay payment for one or more of the following reasons:                  

1)    We cannot determine the amount of the payment because:        
a)    the New York Stock Exchange is closed,            
      b)    trading in securities has been restricted by the SEC, or
c)    the SEC has declared that an emergency exists,    
     2)    The SEC by order permits Us to delay payment to protect Our owners,
or                                                      
3)    Your premium check(s) have not cleared Your bank.             

Federal laws designed to counter terrorism and prevent money laundering by      
criminals might in certain circumstances require Us to reject a premium payment 
and/or "freeze" a contract owner's account. If these laws apply in a particular 
situation, We would not be allowed to process any request for withdrawals,      
surrenders, or death benefits, make transfers, or continue making annuity       
payments. If a contract or account is frozen, the accumulation value would be   
moved to a special segregated interest bearing account and held in that account 
until We receive instructions from the appropriate federal regulator. We may    
also be required to provide information about You and Your contract to the      
government agencies and departments.                                            

DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACTS 

We have entered into a distribution agreement with Our affiliate, Sammons       
Securities Company, LLC ("Sammons Securities Company") for the distribution and 
sale of the contracts. Sammons Securities Company is an indirect wholly owned   
subsidiary of Sammons Enterprises, Inc., of Dallas, Texas, the ultimate parent  
company of Midland National Life Insurance Company. Sammons Securities Company  
offers the contracts through its registered representatives. Sammons Securities 
Company may enter into written sales agreements with other broker-dealers       
("selling firms") for the sale of the contracts. We pay commissions to Sammons  
Securities Company for sales of the contracts by its registered representatives 
as Well as by selling firms. All of the portfolio companies make payments to    
Midland National under their distribution plans in consideration of services    
provided and expenses incurred by Midland National in distributing portfolio    
shares. These payments range from 0.35% to 0.50% of Separate Account assets     
invested in the particular fund.                                                

Sales commissions may vary, but the maximum commission payable for contract     
sales is 6.5% of premiums payments. Where lower commissions are paid, We may    
also pay trail commissions. We may also pay additional amounts and reimburse    
additional expenses of Sammons Securities Company based on various factors.     

We also pay for Sammons Securities Company's operating and other expenses,      
including the following sales expenses: sales representative training           
allowances; compensation and bonuses for the Sammons Securities Company's       
management team; advertising expenses; and all other expenses of distributing   
the contracts. Sammons Securities Company pays its registered representatives   
all or a portion of the commissions received for their sales of contracts.      
Registered representatives and their managers are also eligible for various cash
benefits, such as bonuses, insurance benefits and financing arrangements, and   
non-cash compensation items that We may provide jointly with Sammons Securities 
Company.                                                                        

Non-cash items that We and Sammons Securities Company may provide include       
conferences, seminars and trips (including travel, lodging and meals in         
connection therewith), entertainment, merchandise and other similar items. In   
addition, Sammons Securities Company's registered representatives who meet      
certain productivity, persistency and length of service standards and/or their  
managers may be eligible for additional compensation. Sales of the contracts may
help registered representatives and/or their managers qualify for such benefits.
Sammons Securities Company's registered representatives and managers may receive
other payments from Us for services that do not directly involve the sale of the
contracts, including payments made for the recruitment and training of          
personnel, production of promotional literature and similar services.           

A portion of the payments made to selling firms may be passed on to their       
registered representatives in accordance with their internal compensation

APPENDIX I
 Five for Life Plus Rider - Examples

Basic Calculations                                                              

Example 1: Assume You select the Five for Life Plus Rider when You purchase Your
contract, You are age 65 and Your initial premium is $100,000.                  
  o     Your Guaranteed Payment Benefit (GPB) is $100,000, which is Your
initial premium.                                        
o     Your GPA is $7,000, which is 7% of Your initial GPB.          
o     Your LPA is $5,000, which is 5% of Your initial GPB.          

Example 2: Assume the same facts as Example 1. If You make an additional premium
payment of $50,000, then:                                                       
     o     Your GPB would be $150,000, which is Your prior GPB ($100,000) plus
Your additional premium payment ($50,000).              
  o     Your GPA is $10,500, which is Your prior GPA ($7,000) plus 7% of
Your additional premium payment ($3,500).               
      o     Your LPA is $7,500, which is Your prior LPA ($5,000) plus 5% of Your
additional premium payment ($2,500).                    

Example 3: Assume the same facts as Example 1. If You withdraw the maximum LPA  
($5,000) before the end of the first contract year, then                        
    o     Your GPB becomes $95,000, which is Your prior GPB ($100,000) minus
the LPA withdrawal ($5,000).                            
     o     Your GPA for the next year remains $7,000, because You did not take
more than the maximum GPA ($7,000).                     
     o     Your LPA for the next year remains $5,000, because You did not take
more than the maximum LPA ($5,000).                     

Example 4: Assume the same facts as Example 1, except the issue age is 64. You  
would not have an LPA benefit until age 65. On Your first contract anniversary  
You would be 65, so Your LPA would calculate.                                   
o     Your GPB is $100,000, which was Your initial premium.         
o     Your GPA is $7,000, which is 7% of Your initial GPB.          
      o     Your LPA would be $5,000, which is 5% of Your GPB ($100,000) on Your
contract anniversary.                                   

Withdrawals for more than Your GPA                                              

Example 5: Assume the same facts as Example 1. If You withdraw $40,000 and Your 
accumulation value is $150,000 at the time of withdrawal, then                  
   o     Your GBP is $60,000, which is the lesser of Your new accumulation
       value ($110,000) and Your GPB prior to the withdrawal minus the
withdrawal ($60,000).                                   
  o     Your GPA is $7,000, which is the lesser of Your GPA prior to the
         withdrawal ($7,000) and 7% times the greater of Your accumulation
     value ($110,000) and Your GPB ($60,000) after the withdrawal.
  o     Your LPA is $5,000, which is the lesser of Your LPA prior to the
         withdrawal ($5,000) and 5% times the greater of Your accumulation
     value ($110,000) and Your GPB ($60,000) after the withdrawal.

Example 6: Assume the same facts as Example 1. If You withdraw $60,000 and Your 
accumulation value is $150,000 at the time of withdrawal, then                  
   o     Your GBP is $40,000, which is the lesser of Your new accumulation
      value ($90,000) and Your GPB prior to the withdrawal minus the
withdrawal ($40,000).                                   
  o     Your GPA is $6,300, which is the lesser of Your GPA prior to the
         withdrawal ($7,000) and 7% times the greater of Your accumulation
    value ($90,000) and Your GPB ($40,000) after the withdrawal.
  o     Your LPA is $4,500, which is the lesser of Your LPA prior to the
         withdrawal ($5,000) and 5% times the greater of Your accumulation
    value ($90,000) and Your GPB ($40,000) after the withdrawal.

Example 7: Assume the same facts as Example 1. If You withdraw $40,000 and Your 
accumulation value is $90,000 at the time of withdrawal, then                   
   o     Your GBP is $50,000, which is the lesser of Your new accumulation
      value ($50,000) and Your GPB prior to the withdrawal minus the
withdrawal ($60,000).                                   
  o     Your GPA is $4,200, which is the lesser of Your GPA prior to the
         withdrawal ($7,000) and 7% times the greater of Your accumulation
    value ($50,000) and Your GPB ($50,000) after the withdrawal.
  o     Your LPA is $2,500, which is the lesser of Your LPA prior to the
         withdrawal ($5,000) and 5% times the greater of Your accumulation
    value ($50,000) and Your GPB ($50,000) after the withdrawal.

Step-Up                                                                         

Example 8: Assume the same facts as in Example 1. If You elect to "Step-Up" Your
benefit after the 5th contract anniversary following the addition of this rider 
to Your contract, assuming You have made no withdrawals during the 5 years the  
rider has been in force, and Your accumulation value at the time of step up is  
$200,000, then                                                                  
o     Your GPB is $200,000, which is Your accumulation value on the 
Step-Up Date.                                           
    o     Your new GPA is $14,000, which is the greater of Your GPA prior to
Step-Up ($7,000) and 7% of Your new GPB ($200,000).     
    o     Your new LPA is $10,000, which is the greater of Your LPA prior to
Step-Up ($5,000) and 5% of Your new GPB ($200,000).     

Example 9: Assume the same facts as in Example 1. If You had taken $5,000       
withdrawals each of Your first 5 contract years, Your GPB would be $75,000. If  
You elect to "Step-Up" Your benefit after the 5th contract anniversary and Your 
accumulation value at the time of step up is $90,000, then                      
      o     Your GPB is $90,000, which is Your accumulation value on the Step-Up
Date.                                                   
   o     Your new GPA is $7,000, which is the greater of Your GPA prior to
Step-Up ($7,000) and 7% of Your new GPB ($90,000).      
   o     Your new LPA is $5,000, which is the greater of Your LPA prior to
Step-Up ($5,000) and 5% of Your new GPB ($90,000).      

Bonus Credit                                                                    

Example 10: Assume the same facts as in Example 1. If You have not taken any    
withdrawals as of Your first contract anniversary, You would get a Bonus Credit,
then                                                                            
   o     Your GPB is $102,000, which is Your GPB prior to the Bonus Credit
($100,000) plus 2% of Your initial GPB ($100,000).      
   o     Your GPA is $7,140, which is the greater of Your GPA prior to the
    Bonus Credit ($7,000) and 7% of Your current GPB ($102,000).
   o     Your LPA is $5,100, which is the greater of Your LPA prior to the
    Bonus Credit ($5,000) and 5% of Your current GPB ($102,000).

Example 11: Assume the same facts as in Example 3. Since You took a withdrawal  
in year 1, You would not get a Bonus Credit in year 1. If You have not taken any
withdrawals in year 2, You would get a Bonus Credit, then                       
  o     Your GPB is $97,000, which is Your GPB prior to the Bonus Credit
($95,000) plus 2% of Your initial GPB ($100,000).       
   o     Your GPA is $7,000, which is the greater of Your GPA prior to the
   Bonus Credit ($7,000) and 7% of Your current GPB ($97,000).
   o     Your LPA is $5,000, which is the greater of Your LPA prior to the
   Bonus Credit ($5,000) and 5% of Your current GPB ($97,000).

Example 12: Assume the same facts as in Example 11. Since You took a withdrawal 
in year 1, You would not get a bonus credit in year 1. Since You did not take a 
withdrawal in year 2, You would receive a bonus credit in year 2. Now assume You
took a withdrawal in year 3 for $50,000. You would not get a bonus credit in    
year 3 and, because the $50,000 exceeds Your GPA of $7,000, You will not be     
eligible to receive any more bonus credits, even if You do not take withdrawals 
in years 4 and 5.                                                               

Additional Examples                                                             

Example 13: Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except the issue age is 60.  
Since the issue age is 60, the LPA would not calculate for 5 years (until age   
65). Assume You take withdrawals of $5,000 each of the first 5 years, then      
 o     Your GPB is $75,000, which is Your initial GPB ($100,000) minus
$5,000 for 5 years.                                     
   o     Your GPA is $7,000, which is Your initial GPA ($7,000), since You
have not taken more than Your GPA in any contract year. 
     o     Your initial LPA is $3,750, which is 5% times Your GPB ($75,000) on
Your 5th contract anniversary.                          

Example 14: Assume the same facts as in Example 13. If You take a withdrawal for
$4,000 which is greater than Your LPA, but less than Your GPA, then Your LPA    
would recalculate, and                                                          
   o     Your GPB is $71,000, which is Your prior GPB ($75,000) minus Your
       withdrawal ($4,000) since the withdrawal was less than the GPA.
     o     Your GPA for the next year remains $7,000, because You did not take
more than the maximum GPA ($7,000).                     
o     Your LPA is $3,550, which is 5% times Your GPB ($71,000).

THE CONTRACT

ENTIRE CONTRACT 
The entire contract between You and Us consists of the contract, the attached   
written application and any attached endorsements, riders, and amendments.      

CHANGES TO THE CONTRACT 
No one has the right to change any part of the contract or to waive any of its  
provisions unless the change is approved in writing by one of Our officers. Only
our President or Secretary may modify the contract.                             

We may change the contract without Your consent to conform to state or federal  
laws or regulations. A change will be made by attaching an endorsement to the   
contract.                                                                       

INCONTESTABILITY 

We will not contest the contract.                                               

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX 
If the age or sex of the annuitant has been misstated, We will adjust the amount
of each annuity payment to whatever the applied value would have purchased at   
the correct age and sex. Any underpayments made by Us will be paid to the payee.
Any overpayments made by Us will be charged against benefits falling due after  
adjustment. All underpayments and overpayments will include interest at the rate
required by the jurisdiction in which the contract is delivered.                

NON-PARTICIPATING 
The contract does not participate in the surplus or profits of the Company and  
the Company does not pay any dividends on it.                                   

CLAIMS OF CREDITORS 
To the extent permitted by law, no benefits payable under the contract to a     
beneficiary or payee are subject to the claims of creditors.                    

MINIMUM BENEFITS 
The annuity payments, surrender values and death benefit under the contract are 
not less than the minimum required by the laws of the state in which the        
contract is delivered.                                                          

OWNERSHIP 
The contract belongs to You. You have all rights granted by the contract,       
including the right to change owners and beneficiaries, subject to the rights   
of:                                                                             

1)    Any assignee of record with Us;                               
2)    Any irrevocable beneficiary; and                              
3)    Any restricted ownership.                                     

We must receive written notice informing Us of any change, designation or       
revocation. Once recorded, a change, designation or revocation takes effect as  
of the date the written notice was signed. However, We are not liable for       
payments made by Us before We record the written notice. A change of owner may  
have adverse tax consequences.                                                  

ASSIGNMENT 
An assignment may have adverse tax consequences.                                
You may assign the contract by giving Us written notice. We will not be         
responsible for the validity of any assignment. We will not be liable for any   
payments We make prior to recording the written notice of assignment.           

ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUE 
We determine accumulation unit values for each investment division of Our       
Separate Account at the end of each business day. The accumulation unit value   
for each investment division was initially set at $10.00. The accumulation unit 
value for any business day is equal to the accumulation unit value for the      
preceding business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that division
on that business day.                                                           

We determine the net investment factor for each investment division every       
business day as follows:                                                        

     o     First, We take the net asset value per share held in the investment
          division at the end of the current business day plus the per share
            amount of any dividends or capital gain distributions on shares held
          in the investment divisions on the current business day; minus the
        per share amount of any capital loss, realized or unrealized, on
            shares held in the investment divisions on the current business day.
      o     Then, We divide this amount by the net asset value per share held in
         the investment division at the close of business on the preceding
         business day (after giving effect to any contract transactions on
that day).                                              
      o     Then, We subtract a daily asset charge for each calendar day between
            business days (for example, a Monday calculation may include charges
           for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday). The daily current charge for the
            basic contract, without the optional riders, is currently 0.005205%,
        which is an effective annual rate of 1.90% for contracts with an
           accumulation value between $0 -$24,999; 0.004658%which is an annual
      rate of 1.70% for contracts with an accumulation value between
          $25,000 - $99,999 and 0.004521% for contracts with an accumulation
            value of $100,000 and over. This charge is for mortality and expense
          risks assumed by Us under the contract and to cover administrative
            costs We incur for transactions related to the Separate Account. The
       daily charge, for a contract with the maximum rider charges, is
          currently 0.010685% which is an effective annual rate of 3.90% for
            contracts with an accumulation value between $0 - $24,999; 0.010137%
           which is an annual rate of 3.70% for contracts with an accumulation
            value between $25,000 - $99,999 and 0.010000 which is an annual rate
         of 3.65% for contracts with an accumulation value of $100,000 and
over.                                                   
      o     Finally, We reserve the right to subtract any other daily charge for
taxes or amounts set aside as a reserve for taxes.      

Generally, this means that We would adjust unit values to reflect what happens  
to the funds, and also for any charges.                                         

ANNUITY PAYMENTS 
The amount of each fixed annuity payment will be set on the Maturity Date and   
will not subsequently be affected by the investment performance of the          
investment divisions.                                                           

The amount of each variable annuity payment will be affected by the investment  
performance of the investment divisions. Variable payment options are not       
available in certain states.                                                    

The dollar amount of the first monthly variable annuity payment is computed for 
each investment division by applying the value in the investment division, as of
a date not more than 10 business days prior to the maturity date, to the        
appropriate rate for the payout option selected using the age and sex (where    
permissible) of the annuitant. The number of annuity units for each investment  
division is then calculated by dividing the first variable annuity payment for  
that investment division by the investment division's annuity unit value as of  
the same date.                                                                  

The dollar amount of each subsequent payment from an investment division is     
equal to the number of annuity units for that investment division times the     
annuity unit value for that investment division as of a uniformly applied date  
not more than 10 business days before the annuity payment is due.               

The payment made to the annuitant for the first payment and all subsequent      
payments will be the sum of the payment amounts for each investment division.   

The annuity unit value for each investment division was initially set at $10.   
The Annuity Unit Value for any business day is equal to (1) multiplied by (2)   
multiplied by (3) where:                                                        

(1) = the Annuity Unit Value for the preceding business day:        
  (2) = the net investment factor (as described above) for that division
on that business day.                                   
(3) = the investment result adjustment factor (0.99986634% per day),
        which recognizes an assumed interest rate of 5% per year used in
determining the annuity payment amounts.                

Transfers after the maturity date will only be allowed twice per contract year  
and will be made using the annuity unit value for the investment divisions on   
the date the request for transfer is received. On the transfer date, the number 
of annuity units transferred from the investment division is multiplied by the  
annuity unit value for that investment division to determine the value being    
transferred. This value is then transferred into the indicated investment       
division(s) by converting this value into annuity units of the proper investment
division(s). The annuity units are determined by dividing the value being       
transferred into an investment division by the annuity unit value of the        
investment division on the transfer date. The transfer shall result in the same 
dollar amount of variable annuity payment on the date of transfer.

division (collectively, called "the money market investment division" for the   
purpose of this section) current annualized yield for a seven-day period in a   
manner which does not take into consideration any realized or unrealized gains  
or losses on shares of the money market investment division or on their         
respective portfolio securities. This current annualized yield is computed for  
the money market investment division by determining the net change (exclusive of
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and unrealized appreciation 
and depreciation and income other than investment income) in the value of a     
hypothetical account having a balance of one unit of the money market investment
division at the beginning of such seven-day period, dividing such net change in 
account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to     
determine the base period return and annualizing this quotient on a 365-day     
basis. The net change in account value reflects the deductions for the annual   
maintenance fee, the mortality and expense risk charge, and income and expenses 
accrued during the period. Because of these deductions, the yield for the money 
market investment division of the Separate Account will be lower than the yield 
for the respective money market investment division or any comparable substitute
funding vehicle.                                                                

The Securities and Exchange Commission also permits Midland National to disclose
the effective yield of the money market investment division for the same        
seven-day period, determined on a compounded basis. The effective yield is      
calculated by compounding the unannualized base period return by adding one to  
the base period return, raising the sum to a power equal to 365 divided by 7,   
and subtracting one from the result.                                            

The yield on amounts held in the money market investment division normally will 
fluctuate on a daily basis. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past   
period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of      
return. The money market investment divisions actual yield is affected by       
changes in interest rates on money market securities, average portfolio maturity
of the money market investment division or substitute funding vehicle, the types
and quality of portfolio securities held by the money market investment division
or substitute funding vehicle, and operating expenses. In addition, the yield   
figures are for the base contract only with no rider charges and do not reflect 
the effect of any surrender charge that may be applicable to a particular       
contract.                                                                       

OTHER INVESTMENT DIVISION YIELD CALCULATIONS 

Midland National may from time to time disclose the current annualized yield of 
one or more of the investment divisions (except the money market investment     
division) for 30-day periods. The annualized yield of an investment division    
refers to income generated by the investment division over a specified 30-day   
period. Because the yield is annualized, the yield generated by an investment   
division during the 30-day period is assumed to be generated each 30-day period.
This yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per accumulation   
unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day of the      
period, according to the following formula:                                     

YIELD = 2 [ (a - b + 1)6 - 1 ]                                        
-----                                       
cd                                      

  Where:  a =  net investment income earned during the period by the
portfolio (or substitute funding      
                 vehicle) attributable to shares owned by the investment
division.                             
             b =  expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).
             c =  the average daily number of units outstanding during the
period.                               
               d =  the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the
period.                               

Net investment income will be determined in accordance with rules established by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accrued expenses will include all       
recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts. The yield calculations do
not reflect the effect of any surrender charges that may be applicable to a     
particular contract. Surrender charges range from 7% to 0% of the amount of     
premium withdrawn depending on the elapsed time since the premium was paid.     

Because of the charges and deductions imposed by the Separate Account the yield 
of the investment division will be lower than the yield for the corresponding   
portfolio. The yield on amounts held in the investment divisions normally will  
fluctuate over time. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past period is
not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return. The    
investment division's actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of 
portfolio securities held by the portfolio, and its operating expenses.         

STANDARD TOTAL RETURN CALCULATIONS 

Midland National may from time to time also disclose average annual total       
returns for one or more of the investment divisions for various periods of time.
Average annual total return quotations are computed by finding the average      
annual compounded rates of return over one, five and ten year periods that would
equate the initial amount invested to the ending redeemable value, according to 
the following formula:                                                          
P (1 + T)n = ERV                                                    
Where:        P =     a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000      
T =     average annual total return     
n =     number of years                 
         ERV  =  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical
                   $1,000 payment made at the beginning of the
                    one, five, or ten-year period, at the end of
             the one, five, or ten-year period (or
    fractional portion thereof).

All recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts are recognized in the 
ending redeemable value. This includes a contract charges factor that is        
calculated by taking the daily Separate Account asset charge and adding an      
additional amount that adjusts for the annual $30 annual maintenance fee. This  
additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation value of      
$35,000 so it is calculated as 0.09% annually. The standard average annual total
return calculations assume the contract is surrendered and therefore will       
reflect the effect of surrender charges that may be applicable to a particular  
period.                                                                         

Midland National may disclose average annual total returns in various ways,     
depicting (a) whether the contract is surrendered or maintained in force (b)    
whether the optional Extra Credit Rider is selected; (c) whether other optional 
riders are selected. Accordingly, Midland may disclose the following types of   
average annual total return:                                                    

      1.    The contract is surrendered and has the highest possible combination
of riders;                                              
   2.    The contract is surrendered, but no optional riders are selected;
     3.    The contract is surrendered, the Extra Credit Rider is selected but
no other optional riders are selected;                  
4.    The contract is not surrendered, the Extra Credit Rider is not
          selected, but other optional riders are selected up to the maximum
rider mortality and expense risk charge of 2.0%; and    
     5.    The contract is not surrendered, and neither the Extra Credit Rider
nor any other optional riders are selected.             

Midland National may from time to time also disclose average annual total       
returns in a format, which assumes that the contract is kept in force through   
the time period shown. Such non-standard returns will be identical to the       
standard format, which assumes the contract is surrendered except that the      
contingent deferred sales charge percentage will be assumed to be 0%. The       
non-standard returns, which assume the contract is kept in-force, will only be  
shown in conjunction with standard returns, which assume the contract is        
surrendered.                                                                    

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS 

         Midland National may from time to time also disclose cumulative total
returns in conjunction with the annual returns described above. The cumulative  
returns will be calculated using the following formula.                         

CTR = [ERV/P] - 1                                             
        Where:   CTR =  the cumulative total return net of investment division
   recurring charges for the period.
       ERV =  ending redeemable value of an assumed $1,000
                        payment at the beginning of the one, five, or ten-year
                        period at the end of the one, five, or ten-year period
  (or fractional portion thereof).
P   =  an assumed initial payment of $1,000 

             The returns which assume the contract is kept in-force will only be
shown in conjunction with returns which assume the contract is surrendered.     

      Midland may also disclose the value of an assumed payment of
$10,000 (or other amounts) at the end of various periods of time.               

ADJUSTED HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE DATA 

Midland National may also disclose adjusted historical performance data for an  
investment division for periods before the investment division commenced        
operations, based on the assumption that the investment division was in         
existence before it actually was, and that the investment division had been     
invested in a particular portfolio that was in existence prior to the investment
division's commencement of operations. The portfolio used for these calculations
will be the actual portfolio that the investment division will invest in.       

Adjusted historical performance data of this type will be calculated as follows.
First, the value of an assumed $1,000 investment in the applicable portfolio is 
calculated on a monthly basis by comparing the net asset value per share at the 
beginning of the month with the net asset value per share at the end of the     
month (adjusted for any dividend distributions during the month), and the       
resulting ratio is applied to the value of the investment at the beginning of   
the month to get the gross value of the investment at the end of the month.     
Second, that gross value is then reduced by a "contract charges" factor to      
reflect the charges imposed under the contract. The contract charges factor is  
calculated by taking the daily Separate Account asset charge and adding an      
additional amount that adjusts for the annual $30 annual maintenance fee. This  
additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation value of      
$35,000 so it is calculated as $30/$35,000, or 0.09% annually. The total is then
divided by 12 to get the monthly contract charges factor, which is then applied 
to the value of the hypothetical initial payment in the applicable portfolio to 
get the value in the investment division. The contract charges factor is assumed
to be deducted at the beginning of each month. In this manner, the Ending       
Redeemable Value ("ERV") of a hypothetical $1,000 initial payment in the        
investment division is calculated each month during the applicable period, to   
get the ERV at the end of the period. Third, that ERV is then utilized in the   
formulas above.                                                                 

This type of performance data may be disclosed on both an average annual total  
return and a cumulative total return basis. Moreover, it may be disclosed       
assuming that the contract is not surrendered (i.e., with no deduction for the  
contingent deferred sales charge) and assuming that the contract is surrendered 
at the end of the applicable period (i.e., reflecting a deduction for any       
applicable contingent deferred sales charge).                                   

 FEDERAL TAX MATTERS

TAX-FREE EXCHANGES (SECTION 1035) 

Midland National accepts premiums which are the proceeds of a contract in a     
transaction qualifying for a tax-free exchange under Section 1035 of the        
Internal Revenue Code.                                                          

We also accept "rollovers" from contracts qualifying as individual retirement   
annuities or accounts (IRAs), or any other Qualified contract which is eligible 
to "rollover" into an IRA (except 403(b) contracts). The Company differentiates 
between Non-Qualified contracts and IRAs to the extent necessary to comply with 
federal tax laws. In all events, a tax advisor should be consulted with and     
relied upon before You effect an exchange or a rollover.                        

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS 

In order to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes,  
section 72(s) of the code requires any Non-Qualified contract to provide that   
(a) if any owner dies on or after the annuity date but prior to the time the    
entire interest in the contract has been distributed, the remaining portion of  
such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of    
distribution being used as of the date of that owner's death; and (b) if any    
owner dies prior to the annuity starting date, the entire interest in the       
contract will be distributed (1) within five years after the date of that       
owner's death, or (2) as Annuity payments which will begin within one year of   
that owner's death and which will be made over the life of the owner's          
"designated beneficiary" or over a period not extending beyond the life         
expectancy of that beneficiary. The owner's "designated beneficiary" is the     
person to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of death and must be a
natural person. However, if the owner's designated beneficiary is the surviving 
spouse of the owner, the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as 
the new owner.                                                                  

The nonqualified contracts contain provisions which are intended to comply with 
the requirements of section 72(s) of the Code, although no regulations          
interpreting these requirements have yet been issued. We intend to review such  
provisions and modify them if necessary to assure that they comply with the     
requirements of Code section 72(s) when clarified by regulation or otherwise.   

Other rules may apply to Qualified contracts.                                   

NON-NATURAL PERSON OWNERS 

If a non-natural person (e.g., a corporation or a trust) owns a Non-Qualified   
contract, the taxpayer generally must include in income any increase in the     
excess of the account value over the investment in the contract (generally, the 
premiums or other consideration paid for the contract) during the taxable year. 

There are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a    
natural person should discuss these with a tax adviser.                         

The tax discussion in the prospectus and herein generally applies to contracts  
owned by natural persons.                                                       

DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

The Code requires that the investments of each investment division of the       
Separate Account underlying the contracts be "adequately diversified" in order  
for the contracts to be treated as annuity contracts for Federal income tax     
purposes. It is intended that each investment division, through the fund in     
which it invests, will satisfy these diversification requirements.              

OWNER CONTROL 

In some circumstances, owners of variable contracts who retain control over the 
investment of the underlying Separate Account assets may be treated as owners of
those assets and may be subject to tax on income produced by those assets.      
Although published guidance in this area does not address certain aspects of the
contracts, We believe that the owner of a contract should not be treated as the 
owner of the Separate Account assets. We reserve the right to modify the        
contracts to bring them into conformity with applicable standards should such   
modification be necessary to prevent owners of the contracts from being treated 
as the owners of the underlying Separate Account assets.                        

TAXATION OF QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 

The tax rules applicable to Qualified contracts vary according to the type of   
retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan. Your rights under a   
Qualified contract may be subject to the terms of the retirement plan itself,   
regardless of the terms of the Qualified contract. Adverse tax consequences may 
result if you do not ensure that contributions, distributions and other         
transactions with respect to the contract comply with the law.                  

Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), as defined in Section 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code), permit individuals to make annual contributions of up to   
the lesser of a specific dollar amount or the amount of compensation includible 
in the individual's gross income for the year. The contributions may be         
deductible in whole or in part, depending on the individual's income.           
Distributions from certain retirement plans may be "rolled over" into an IRA on 
a tax-deferred basis without regard to these limits. Amounts in the IRA (other  
than nondeductible contributions) are taxed when distributed from the IRA. A 10%
penalty tax generally applies to distributions made before age 59 1/2, unless   
certain exceptions apply.                                                       

Roth IRAs, as described in Code section 408A, permit certain eligible           
individuals to contribute to make non-deductible contributions to a Roth IRA in 
cash or as a rollover or transfer from another Roth IRA or other IRA. A rollover
from or conversion of an IRA to a Roth IRA is generally subject to tax and other
special rules apply. The owner may wish to consult a tax adviser before         
combining any converted amounts with any other Roth IRA contributions, including
any other conversion amounts from other tax years. Distributions from a Roth IRA
generally are not taxed, except that, once aggregate distributions exceed       
contributions to the Roth IRA, income tax and a 10% penalty tax may apply to    
distributions made (1) before age 59 1/2 (subject to certain exceptions) or (2) 
during the five taxable years starting with the year in which the first         
contribution is made to any Roth IRA. A 10% penalty tax may apply to amounts    
attributable to a conversion from an IRA if they are distributed during the five
taxable years beginning with the year in which the conversion was made.         

Corporate pension and profit-sharing plans under Section 401(a) of the Code     
allow corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for    
employees, and self-employed individuals to establish qualified plans for       
themselves and their employees. Adverse tax consequences to the retirement plan,
the participant or both may result if the contract is transferred to any        
individual as a means to provide benefit payments, unless the plan complies with
all the requirements applicable to such benefits prior to transferring the      
contract.                                                                       

Tax Sheltered Annuities under section 403(b) of the Code allow employees of     
certain Section 501(c)(3) organizations and public schools to exclude from their
gross income the premium payments made, within certain limits, on a contract    
that will provide an annuity for the employee's retirement. These premium       
payments may be subject to FICA (social security) tax.                          

Distributions of (1) salary reduction contributions made in years beginning     
after December 31, 1988; (2) earnings on those contributions; and (3) earnings  
on amounts held as of the last year beginning before January 1, 1989, are not   
allowed prior to age 59 1/2, severance from employment, death or disability.    
Salary reduction contributions may also be distributed upon hardship, but would 
generally be subject to penalties.                                              

Section 457 Plans, while not actually providing for a qualified plan as that    
term is normally used, provides for certain deferred compensation plans with    
respect to service for state governments, local governments, political          
subdivisions, agencies, instrumentalities and certain affiliates of such        
entities, and tax exempt organizations. The contract can be used with such      
plans. Under such plans a participant may specify the form of investment in     
which his or her participation will be made. Under a non-governmental plan, all 
such investments, however, are owned by and are subject to, the claims of the   
general creditors of the sponsoring employer. In general, all amounts received  
under a section 457 plan are taxable and are subject to federal income tax      
withholding as wages.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Following is a summary of the Application. The complete Application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 5th Street NW, Washington, DC 20549, (202) 942-8090. 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Midland is a stock life insurance company. Midland was organized in 1906, in South Dakota, as a mutual life insurance company at that time named The Dakota Mutual Life Insurance Company. It was reincorporated as a stock life insurance company in 1909. The name Midland was adopted in 1925. Midland was redomesticated to Iowa in 1999. It is licensed to do business in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and in all states except New York. Midland is a subsidiary of Sammons Enterprises, Inc. which has controlling or substantial stock interests in a large number of other companies engaged in the areas of insurance, corporate services, and industrial distribution. 
2. Under the terms of the Contracts, the assets of the Midland Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the Midland Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business which the sponsoring company may conduct (except to the extent that assets in the Midland Account exceed the reserves and liabilities of the Midland Account). The Midland Account is comprised of investment divisions established to receive and invest net premium payments under the Contracts (the “Investment Divisions”) and other annuity contracts. The income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from the assets allocated to each Investment Division will be credited to or charged against that Investment Division without regard to other income, gains or losses of any other Investment Division. The Midland Account meets the definition of a “separate account” in Rule 0-1(e) under the Act. 
3. The Board of Directors of Midland established the Midland Account under the insurance laws of the State of South Dakota in March 1991. The Midland Account is now governed by Iowa law. The Midland Account is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-07772). The assets of the Midland Account support certain flexible premium variable annuity contracts, and interests in the Midland Account offered through such contracts have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (“1933 Act”) on two Form N-4 Registration Statements (File Nos. 33-64016 and 333-71800). 
4. Sammons Securities, an affiliate of Midland, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts. Sammons Securities is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the NASD. 
5. Each Investment Division will invest exclusively in a designated series of shares, representing an interest in a particular portfolio of one or more designated management investment companies of the series type (“Funds”). Midland reserves the right to designate the shares of another portfolio of the Funds or of other management investment companies (“Other Funds”) as the exclusive investment vehicle for each new Investment Division that may be created in the future. Subject to Commission approval under section 26(c) of the Act, Applicants also reserve the right to substitute the shares of another portfolio of the Funds or of Other Funds for the portfolio previously designated as the exclusive investment vehicle for each Investment Division. 
6. The Contracts are flexible premium variable annuity contracts issued by Midland through the Midland Account. Midland currently intends to market the Contract under the name “Variable Annuity III.” The Contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a variable basis, fixed basis, or both during the accumulation period, and may provide settlement or annuity payment plans on a variable basis, fixed basis, or both. The Contracts may be purchased on a non-qualified tax basis. The Contracts may also be purchased and used in connection with plans qualifying for favorable federal income tax treatment. 
7. The Owner determines in the application or transmittal form for a Contract how the net premium payments will be allocated among the Investment Divisions of the Midland Account, the Fixed Account and any available dollar cost averaging options of the Fixed Account (the “Fixed Start Printed Page 18048Account Options”). The Owner generally may allocate premium payments to each Investment Division and to each Fixed Account Option. The Accumulation Value will vary with the investment performance of the Investment Divisions selected, and the Owner bears the entire risk for amounts allocated to the Investment Divisions. 
8. An Owner may return his or her Contract for a refund. This is called the “Free Look Right.” The Free Look Right allows an Owner 10 days (or longer if required by state law) to return his or her Contract. Midland will generally return the Accumulation Value minus any premium bonus credit to the Owner, but may return the full premium payment (not including the bonus credit), if greater and required by state law. Midland will generally pay the refund within 7 days after it receives a written notification of cancellation and the returned Contract. The Contract will then be considered void. 
9. An Owner may transfer Accumulation Value. Transfers out of an Investment Division generally must be for at least $200, or the entire value of the Investment Division. Free transfers may be limited to twelve per contract year and a $15 charge per transfer may then apply for any additional transfers. 
10. The Owner may surrender the Contract or make a partial surrender from the Accumulation Value until the maturity date. If an Owner surrenders a Contract or takes a partial surrender, Midland may deduct a surrender charge to compensate it for expenses relating to sales, including commissions to registered representatives and other promotional expenses. An Owner is permitted to withdraw 10% of net premiums (premiums minus surrenders) once each Contract Year free of a surrender charge. The following chart shows the surrender charges that apply to the Contracts: 
Number of years since premium payment dateSurrender charge (as a percentage of premium withdrawn)172736455463728 or more0
Midland currently will partially waive the surrender charge if an Owner withdraws money under the Terminal Illness or Charitable Remainder Trust riders. 
11. Midland offers a Charitable Remainder Trust benefit which provides for a potential increase in the free surrender amount. Under this benefit, the free surrender amount is the greater of: (a) the Owner's Accumulation Value minus net premiums at the close of the prior business day; or (b) 10% of the Owner's net premiums at the time of the partial surrender. This benefit is only available if the Owner is a charitable remainder trust. There is no charge for this benefit. 
12. Under the Contracts, Midland will pay a death benefit under certain circumstances. Midland's death benefit equals the greatest of: (a) The Accumulation Value; (b) 100% of the total net premium payments, or (c) if elected, the guaranteed minimum death benefit. The guaranteed minimum death benefit equals the greater of total premiums paid minus any surrenders accumulated at 7% per annum (limited to an additional 100% of premiums minus surrenders) or the Accumulation Value. Future Contracts may provide different death benefits. The Accumulation Value for purposes of the death benefit is calculated on the date Midland receives the later of due proof of death or the election form of how the death benefit is to be paid, or 90 days after receipt of due proof of death. 
13. If an Owner elects the Bonus Credit Rider under the Contracts, then Midland will add a 4% bonus credit to each premium payment made during the first contract year. Midland will assess a daily charge during the first 7 contract years against the Owner's Accumulation Value in the Midland Account as a charge for the optional bonus credit rider. The current charge for this rider is at an annual rate of 0.60% of the Separate Account accumulation value. The guaranteed maximum level of this charge is 0.70% annually. 
14. On the maturity date the Owner may take the surrender value in one lump sum or convert the surrender value into an annuity. The Owner may elect or change an annuity payment option up until thirty days before the maturity date. The first annuity payment will be made within one month after the maturity date. The Owner generally may change the maturity date, subject to limits specified in the prospectus. 
15. The amount of each annuity payment under the annuity payment plans will depend on the sex (if allowed) and age of the annuitant (or annuitants) at the time the first payment is due and the payment option. 
16. Midland may offer Owners dollar cost averaging programs, where Midland will automatically transfer money from one investment option into any of the other Investment Divisions; a portfolio rebalancing program, where Midland will automatically rebalance, on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, the amounts in an Owner's Investment Divisions according to his or her desired asset allocation; a fixed account earnings sweep program, where Midland will transfer, on a monthly or quarterly basis, Fixed Account interest earnings to one or more of the Investment Divisions; and a systematic withdrawal option, where an Owner may receive regular payments from his or her Contract, subject to certain limitations; or other programs. 
17. Midland deducts various fees and charges from the Contracts or the Midland Account, which currently include a daily mortality and expense risk fee; an annual maintenance fee (which may be waived if the Owner's net premium exceeds a certain level); premium taxes; surrender charges (contingent deferred sales loads); and fees for optional benefits or riders. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Applicants respectfully request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, grant the exemptions set forth below to permit the Applicants to recapture the bonus credit applied to premium payments when the Owner exercises his or her free look right. 
2. Section 6(c) authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the contract and provisions of the Act. Because the provisions described below may be inconsistent with a recapture of a bonus credit, Applicants request exemptions for the Contracts described herein, and for Future Contracts, from sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(a) of the Act, and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, pursuant to Section 6(c), to the extent necessary to recapture the bonus credit applied to a premium payment in the instance described above. Applicants do not agree or concede that the proposed recapture would violate any provision of the Act or rules thereunder. Applicants seek exemptions therefrom in order to avoid any questions concerning the Contracts' compliance with the Act and rules thereunder. 
3. For the reasons discussed below, Applicants assert that the recapture of the bonus credit in the circumstances Start Printed Page 18049described herein is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
4. Section 27(i) provides that Section 27 does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts, nor to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account, except as provided for in Section 27(i)(2)(A). Section 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act, in pertinent part, makes it unlawful for any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts, or for the sponsoring insurance company of such account, to sell any such contract unless such contract is a redeemable security. 
5. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines “redeemable security” as any security under the terms of which the holder, upon its presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof. 
6. To the extent that the bonus credit recapture might be seen as a discount from the net asset value, or might be viewed as resulting in the payment to an Owner of less than the proportionate share of the issuer's net assets, the bonus credit recapture would trigger the need for relief absent some exemption from the Act. Rule 6c-8 provides, in relevant part, that a registered separate account, and any depositor of such account, shall be exempt from sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), 27(c)(1), 27(c)(2) and 27(d) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit them to impose a deferred sales load on any variable annuity contract participating in such account. However, the bonus credit recapture is not a sales load, but a recapture of a bonus credit Midland previously applied to an Owner's premium payments. Midland provides the bonus credits from its general account on a guaranteed basis. The Contracts are designed to be long-term investment vehicles. In undertaking this financial obligation, Midland contemplates that an Owner will retain a Contract over an extended period, consistent with the long-term nature of the Contracts. Midland designed its product so that it would recover its costs (including the bonus credit) over an anticipated duration while a Contract is in force. If an Owner withdraws his or her money from the Contract before this anticipated period, Midland must recapture the bonus credit in order to avoid a loss. 
7. Applicants submit that the recapture of a bonus credit does not violate section 2(a)(32) of the Act. The Applicants submit that the bonus recapture provision in the Contracts does not deprive the Owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets. An Owner's right to the bonus credit will vest after the free-look period has expired. Until that time, Midland retains the right and interest in the dollar amount of any unvested bonus credit amount. Thus, when Midland recaptures a bonus credit, it is only retrieving its own assets, and because an Owner's interest in the bonus credit is not vested, such Owner would not be deprived of a proportionate share of the Midland Account's assets (the issuer's current net assets) in violation of Section 2(a)(32). Therefore, such recapture does not reduce the amount of the Midland Account's current net assets an Owner would otherwise be entitled to receive. However, to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, the Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of Sections (2)(a)(32) and 27(i)(2)(A) to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the bonus credit under the Contracts and Future Contracts. 
8. Section 22(c) of the Act states that the Commission may make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies, and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same ends as contemplated by Section 22(a). Rule 22c-1, promulgated under section 22(c) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibits a registered investment company issuing a redeemable security (and a person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in such security, and a principal underwriter of, or dealer in, any such security) from selling, redeeming, or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security. 
9. As a result of a 4% bonus credit, an Owner who made a $10,000 initial premium payment could be viewed as having an Accumulation Value of $10,400 before any earnings accrued. Midland's addition of the bonus credit might arguably be viewed as resulting in an Owner purchasing a redeemable security for a price below the current net asset value. Further, by recapturing the bonus credit, Midland might arguably be redeeming a redeemable security for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the Midland Account. The Applicants contend that these are not correct interpretations or applications of these statutory and regulatory provisions. The Applicants contend that the bonus credit does not violate Section 22(c) and Rule 22c-1. 
10. An Owner's interest in his or her Accumulation Value or in the Midland Account would always be offered at a price based on the net asset value next calculated after receipt of the order. The granting of a bonus credit does not reflect a reduction of that price. Instead, Midland will purchase with its own general account assets an interest in the Midland Account equal to the bonus credit. Because the bonus credit will be paid out of Midland's assets, not the Midland Account's assets, no dilution will occur as a result of the credit. 
11. The recapture of the bonus credit does not involve either of the evils that the Commission intended to eliminate or reduce with Rule 22c-1. The Commission's stated purposes in adopting Rule 22c-1 were to avoid or minimize (a) dilution of the interests of other security holders and (b) speculative trading practices that are unfair to such holders. These evils were the result of backward pricing, the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day. Backward pricing allowed investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price, and thereby the values of outstanding mutual fund shares were diluted. 
12. The proposed recapture of the bonus credit does not pose such threat of dilution. The bonus credit recapture will not alter an Owner's net asset value. Midland will determine an Owner's surrender value under a Contract in accordance with Rule 22c-1 on a basis next computed after receipt of an Owner's request for surrender (likewise, the calculation of death benefits and annuity payment amounts will be in full compliance with the forward pricing requirement of Rule 22c-1). The amount recaptured will equal the amount of the bonus credit that Midland paid out of its general account assets. The Applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the bonus credit in the Midland Account after Midland applies the credit. As a result, the asset-based charges applicable to the Midland Account will be assessed against the entire amount held in the Midland Account, including the bonus credit amount, during the time the bonus credit has not vested (during the “free look” period). Applicants state that during the free look period, the aggregate asset-based charges assessed Start Printed Page 18050against an Owner's Accumulation Value will be higher than those that would be charged if the Owner's Accumulation Value did not include the bonus credit, but the increment will obviously be only a small percentage of the credit amount. On the other hand, an Owner will retain the investment benefit from the bonus credit. Although an Owner will retain any investment gain attributable to the bonus credit, Midland will determine the amount of such gain on the basis of the current net asset value of the Investment Division. Thus, no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the bonus credit. 
13. Further, Applicants submit that the other harm that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address (speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing) will not occur as a result of Midland's recapture of the bonus credit. Variable annuities are designed for long-term investment, and by their nature, do not lend themselves to the kind of speculative short-term trading that Rule 22c-1 was designed to prevent. More to the point, the credit recapture simply does not create the opportunity for speculative trading. 
14. Rule 22c-1 and Section 22(c) should have no application to the bonus credit, as neither of the harms that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address are present in the recapture of the bonus credit. However, to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, the Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of Section 22(c) and Rule 22c-1 to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the bonus credit under the Contracts and Future Contracts. 
15. The Applicants submit that the Commission should grant the exemptions requested in this Application, even if the bonus credit described herein arguably conflicts with sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), or 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act or Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The bonus credit provisions are generally very favorable and very beneficial to Owners. The recapture provisions temper this benefit somewhat, but only if an Owner withdraws his or her money under the circumstance described herein. While there would be a small downside in a declining market where an Owner would bear any losses attributable to the bonus credit, it is the converse of the benefits an Owner would receive on the bonus credit in a rising market. As any earnings on a bonus credit applied would vest immediately with an Owner, likewise any losses on the bonus credit would also vest immediately with an Owner. The bonus credit recapture provision does not diminish the overall value of the bonus credit. 
16. Midland's recapture of the bonus credit is designed to prevent anti-selection against it. The risk of anti-selection would be that an Owner could make significant premium payments into the Contract solely in order to receive a quick profit from the credit. By recapturing a bonus credit, Midland protects itself against the risk that an Owner will make such large premium payments, receive a bonus credit, and then withdraw his or her money from the Contract under the free look provision. Midland generally protects itself from this kind of anti-selection, and recovers its costs in situations where an Owner withdraws his or her money early in the life of a Contract, by imposing a surrender charge of up to 7%. However, where an Owner withdraws his money pursuant to a “free-look” provision, Midland does not apply this charge. Midland is only seeking to recapture the bonus credit in this circumstance where it does not apply the surrender charge. 
17. Midland contends that it would be inherently unfair to allow an Owner exercising the free-look privilege in a Contract to retain the bonus credit when returning the Contract for a refund after a period of only a few days (usually 10 or less). If Midland could not recapture the bonus credit, individuals might purchase a Contract with no intention of retaining it, and simply return it for a quick profit. By recapturing the bonus credit, Midland can and must prevent such individuals from doing so. 
Conclusion 
1. For the reasons discussed above, the Applicants submit that the bonus credit involves none of the abuses to which provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder are directed. The Owner will always retain the investment experience attributable to the bonus credit, and will retain the principal amount in all cases except under the single circumstance described herein. Further, Midland should be able to recapture such bonus credit to protect itself from investors wishing to use the Contract as a vehicle for a quick profit at Midland's expense, and to enable Midland to limit potential losses associated with such bonus credit. 
2. Accordingly, Applicants request exemptions from sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Applicants to recapture the bonus credit applied to a premium payment in the circumstance described above. For the reasons set forth above, Applicants believe that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act, and consistent with and supported by Commission precedent. 
3. Applicants seek relief herein not only for themselves with respect to the support of the Contracts, but also with respect to Future Accounts or Future Contracts described herein. Applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Contracts or Future Contracts funded by the Midland Account or Future Accounts are consistent with the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act and Commission precedent. The Commission has previously granted class relief (from certain specified provisions of the Act for separate accounts that support variable annuity contracts) that is materially similar to the relief described in this Application. 
4. In addition, Applicants seek relief herein with respect to Future Underwriters (i.e., a class consisting of NASD member broker-dealers which may also act as principal underwriter of the Contracts and Future Contracts). The Commission has regularly granted relief to “future underwriters” that are not named, and are not affiliates of the Applicants. Applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Future Underwriters are consistent with the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act and Commission precedent. 
5. Applicants state that, without the requested class relief, exemptive relief for any Future Account, Future Contract, or Future Underwriter would have to be requested and obtained separately. Applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the Act not already addressed herein. Applicants state that if the Applicants were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed herein, investors would not receive additional protection or benefit, and investors and the Applicants could be disadvantaged by increased costs from preparing such additional requests for relief. Applicants argue that the requested class relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for Midland to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. Elimination of the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would, Applicants Start Printed Page 18051opine, enhance Applicants' ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as such opportunities arise. Applicants submit, for all the reasons stated herein, that their request for class exemptions is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act, and that an order of the Commission including such class relief, should, therefore, be granted. Any entity that currently intends to rely on the requested exemptive order is named as an applicant. Any entity that relies upon the requested order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions contained in this Application. 
6. Applicants represent that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

This summary provides only a brief overview of the more important features of   
the contract. The detailed information appearing later in this prospectus       
further explains the following summary. This summary must be read along with    
that detailed information. Unless otherwise indicated, the description of the   
contract in this prospectus assumes that the contract is inforce.               

Features of MNL Advisor Variable Annuity                                        

The MNL Advisor Variable Annuity is a flexible premium deferred variable        
annuity. The contracts described in this prospectus provide for accumulation of 
the accumulation value and payment of annuity payments on a fixed or variable   
basis. The contracts are designed to aid individuals in long-term planning for  
retirement or other long-term purposes.                                         

The contracts are available for situations that do not qualify for the special  
federal tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code (non-qualified 
contract) and for retirement plans which do qualify for those tax advantages    
(qualified contract). This contract does not offer any additional tax benefits  
when purchased under a qualified plan. See "Suitability of the Contracts" on    
page 18 for more detailed information.                                          

This prospectus generally describes only the variable portion of the contract,  
except where the Fixed Account is specifically mentioned.                       

Your "Free Look" Right                                                          

You have a right to examine the contract and return it to Us for any reason.    
Your request generally must be postmarked no later than 10 days (or as required 
by state law) after You receive Your contract. (see "Free Look" on page 29 for  
more details).                                                                  

Your Accumulation Value Your accumulation value depends on:                     

o    the amount and frequency of premium payments,                    

o    the selected portfolio's investment experience,                  

o    interest earned on amounts allocated to the Fixed Account,       

o    partial surrenders, and                                          

o    charges and deductions.                                          

You bear the investment risk under the contract (except for amounts in the Fixed
Account). There is no minimum guaranteed accumulation value with respect to any 
amounts allocated to the Separate Account. (See "Your Accumulation Value" on    
page 30).                                                                       

Flexible Premium Payments                                                       
You may pay premiums whenever You want and in whatever amount You want, within  
certain limits. We generally require an initial minimum premium of at least     
$10,000. However, if You purchase a qualified contract, We may accept an initial
premium of only $2,000. Other premium payments must be at least $50.            

You may choose a planned periodic premium. You need not pay premiums according  
to the planned schedule.                                                        

Unless You receive approval from Us, the maximum amount of premium You can pay  
into this contract prior to the maturity date is $5,000,000. The maximum amount 
of premium that currently can be allocated or transferred to the Fixed Account  
prior to the maturity date is limited to a sum total of $1,000,000 without prior
approval from Us. We reserve the right to further restrict or even eliminate the
ability to allocate or transfer to the Fixed Account.                           

Investment Choices                                                              

You may allocate Your accumulation value to the investment divisions of Our     
Separate Account available under this contract or to Our Fixed Account, which   
pays interest at a declared rate, or to a combination of these options. For     
limitations on premium allocations to the Fixed Account, see "FIXED ACCOUNT" on 
page 25.                                                                        

For a full description of the portfolios, see the funds' prospectuses, which    
accompany this prospectus. (See "The Funds" on page 20).                        

Each portfolio pays a different investment management or advisory fee and       
different operating expenses. More detail concerning each portfolio company's   
fees and expenses is contained in the prospectus for each portfolio company. See
"Investment Policies Of The Funds' Portfolios" on page 20.                      

Transfers                                                                       

You may transfer Your accumulation value among the investment divisions and     
between the Fixed Account and the investment divisions before the maturity date 
(although We reserve the right to eliminate and/or severely restrict the        
transfer privilege in any manner We deem appropriate for some, all or specific  
contract owners). The amount that You can transfer into the Fixed Account is    
limited. See "FIXED ACCOUNT" on page 25 for details. The MYG Options in Our     
Fixed Account are only available at the time of application. No transfers can be
made into any of these options. Transfers out of the MYG Options may be subject 
to an interest adjustment. See "Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG) Options" on page 26. 
After the maturity date, You may make two transfers each year among the Separate
Account investment divisions.                                                   

We require a minimum amount, usually $200 (or 100% of an investment division if 
less than $200), for each transfer.                                             

Currently, We do not charge for making transfers. However, We reserve the right 
to assess a $15 administrative charge for each transfer after the 12th transfer 
in a contract year. Completed transfer requests received at Our Principal Office
before the New York Stock Exchange closes for regular trading (usually 3:00 p.m.
Central Time) are priced at the unit value determined at the close of that      
regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange. If We receive Your      
completed transfer request after the close of regular trading on the New York   
Stock Exchange, We will process the transfer request at the unit value          
determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the New York     
Stock Exchange. See definition of "Business Day" on page 7. For limitations on  
transfers to and from the Fixed Account, see "FIXED ACCOUNT" on page 25. For    
restrictions on transfers due to market timing, see "Transfer Limitations" on   
page 31.                                                                        

Surrenders                                                                      

You may generally withdraw all or part of Your surrender value at any time,     
before annuity payments begin. You may also elect a systematic withdrawal option
(See "Systematic Withdrawals" on page 38). (Your retirement plan may restrict   
surrenders.) You may withdraw up to 10% of Your gross premiums (sum of all      
premiums paid as determined on the date of the surrender request), once each    
contract year without incurring a surrender charge. However, by current Company 
practice, We will allow multiple free withdrawals up to 10% of gross premiums   
each contract year. This is not guaranteed. (See "Free Surrender Amount" on page
39). We may impose a surrender charge on any surrender in excess of the free    
surrender amount (including surrenders to begin annuity payments), and upon full
surrender. We may also deduct an annual maintenance fee on a full surrender. The
amount You request plus any surrender charge will be deducted from Your         
accumulation value. Any amount You withdraw from a MYG Option will be subject to
an interest adjustment as well as surrender charges. You may take a surrender in
a lump sum or use it to purchase an annuity that will continue as long as You   
live or for some other period You select. A surrender may have negative tax     
consequences, including a 10% tax penalty on certain surrenders prior to age 59 
1/2. Under non-qualified contracts, gain, if any, is withdrawn first for tax    
purposes and is taxed as ordinary income. (See "Surrender Charges on Surrenders"
on page 41, "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 44, and "Selecting An Annuity Option"  
on page 49.) Surrenders from contracts used for tax-qualified retirement plans  
may be restricted or penalized by the terms of the plan or applicable law.      

Annuitization Bonus                                                             
If You decide to annuitize Your contract any time after the 4th contract        
anniversary, We guarantee that We will credit Your accumulation value with an   
additional percentage (of the Accumulation Value) based on the pay-out option   
You choose as follows:                                                          

o    A 2% annuitization bonus will be credited on any payout option   
         available under this contract that guarantees payment for ten or more
years.                                                      

    o    A 1% annuitization bonus will be credited on all other payout options
available under this contract.                              

There is no additional charge for the annuitization bonus.                      

Risk of Increase in Fees and Charges                                            
Certain fees and charges assessed against the contract are currently at levels  
below the guaranteed maximum levels. We may increase these fees and charges up  
to the guaranteed maximum level.                                                

Effects of Market Timing                                                        
Frequent, large, programmed, or short-term transfers among the investment       
divisions or between the investment divisions and the Fixed Account ("Harmful   
Trading) can cause risks with adverse effects for other contract owners (and    
beneficiaries and portfolios). These risks and harmful effects include: (1)     
dilution of the interests of long-term investors in an investment division if   
transfers into the division are made at unit values that are priced below the   
true value or transfers out of the investment division are made at unit values  
priced higher than the true value (some "market timers" attempt to do this      
through methods known as "time-zone arbitrage" and "liquidity arbitrage"); (2)  
an adverse effect on portfolio management, such as causing the portfolio to     
maintain a higher level of cash than would otherwise be the case, or causing a  
portfolio to liquidate investments prematurely (or otherwise at an inopportune  
time) in order to pay withdrawals; and (3) increased brokerage and              
administrative expenses.                                                        

In addition, because other insurance companies and/or retirement plans may      
invest in the portfolios, the risk exists that that the portfolios may suffer   
harm from frequent, programmed, large, or short-term transfers among investment 
divisions of variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among    
investment options available to retirement plan participants.

The next table lists the fees and expenses that You may pay periodically during 
the time that You own the contract, not including portfolio company fees and

1 We reserve the right to impose a $15 charge for each transfer after 
the twelve (12th) transfer in a contract year.                    

2 The annual maintenance fee is deducted proportionally from the      
   accumulation value at the time of the charge. We reserve the right to
 change this fee, however, it will not exceed $60 per contract year.
The annual maintenance fee is reflected in the examples below by a
    method intended to show the "average" impact of the annual maintenance
fee on an investment in the Separate Account. By current Company  
practice, the annual maintenance fee is deducted only when the net
    premiums are less than $50,000. We reserve the right to change this in
    the future. Currently, We waive the annual maintenance fee for Section
403(b), SEP-IRA, and 457 Qualified Plans.                         

Range of Annual Operating Expenses for the Portfolios1                          
The next item shows the lowest and highest total operating expenses charged by  
the portfolio companies for the year ended December 31, 2003 (before any fee    
waiver or expense reimbursement). Expenses may be higher or lower in the future.
More detail concerning each portfolio company's fees and expenses is contained  
in the prospectus for each portfolio company.

EXPENSE EXAMPLES 

The following examples are intended to help You compare the cost of   
investing in the contract with the cost of investing in other variable
     annuity contracts. These costs include contract owner transaction expenses,
  annual maintenance fees, Separate Account annual expenses, and portfolio
    company operating expenses (for the year ended December 31, 2003). This is
     not guaranteed. In the examples, the annual maintenance fee is approximated
as an annual asset charge of 0.17% (guaranteed) based on the estimated
average accumulation value.                                           

Both examples assume that You invest $10,000 in the contract for the time       
periods indicated. The Examples also assume that Your investment has a 5% return
each year. Although Your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these    
assumptions, Your costs would be:

not included in this document, as no contracts had been issued under this

Charges and Fees

Surrender Charge                                                                

Sales expenses are not deducted from premium payments. However, a surrender     
charge may be assessed against premium payments when they are withdrawn,        
including full and partial surrenders to effect an annuity and systematic       
withdrawals. (See "Surrender Charges on Surrenders" on page 41.)                

The length of time between the receipt of each premium payment and the surrender
determines the surrender charge. For this purpose, premium payments will be     
deemed to be withdrawn in the order in which they are received and all partial  
surrenders will be made first from premium payments and then from other         
accumulation values. The charge is a percentage of the premium withdrawn and is 
as follows:

No Surrender charge will be assessed upon:                                      

(a) payment of death benefits;                                            
(b) exercise of the free look right; and                                  
(c) surrender of the free surrender amount.                               

Under Midland National's current Company practice, amounts withdrawn under the  
contract to comply with IRS minimum distribution rules are not subject to       
surrender charges. We reserve the right to change this practice in the future.  

At the time of a withdrawal, if Your accumulation value is less than Your net   
premium, the surrender charge will still be assessed against the full remaining 
net premium amount. For example, if at the beginning of Your second contract    
year Your net premium was $10,000 and Your accumulation value was $8,000, then  
in the event of a surrender, the second year surrender charge percentage of 8%  
would be charged on the $10,000 net premium amount and not the $8,000           
accumulation value amount.                                                      

Interest Adjustment                                                             

Any portion of the Fixed Account accumulation value allocated to a MYG Option   
may be subject to an interest adjustment. (See "Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG)
Options" on page 26. Surrenders may have tax consequences. (See "FEDERAL TAX
STATUS" on page 44.)                                                            

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge                                               
We deduct a 1.55% per annum charge against all accumulation values held in the  
Separate Account for assuming the mortality and expense and other risks under   
the contract. (See "Mortality and Expense Risk Charge" on page 41.)             

Annual Maintenance Fee                                                          

We currently deduct an annual maintenance fee of $30 from each contract. We     
reserve the right to increase this charge, however, it will not exceed $60 per  
contract year. Currently, We waive the annual maintenance fee for Section       
403(b), SEP-IRA, and 457 Qualified Plans and for contracts with net premiums of 
$50,000 or more on the contract anniversary. (See "CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS"
on page 41.)                                                                    

Transfer Fee                                                                    
There may be a $15 charge for each transfer in excess of 12 in any one contract 
year.                                                                           

Premium Taxes                                                                   
We will deduct the amount of any premium taxes levied by a state or any         
government entity from Your accumulation value at surrender, death or           
annuitization. (See "Premium Taxes" on page 43).                                

Loan Charge (TSA Contracts Only)                                                
Loan interest is charged in arrears on any outstanding loan. Loan interest that 
is unpaid when due will be added to the outstanding loan on each contract       
anniversary (or, if earlier, on the date of loan repayment, surrender, contract 
termination, or the death of the owner or annuitant) and will bear interest at  
the same rate of the loan. We charge an annual interest rate of 4.0% on loans.  

After offsetting the 1.5% annual interest rate that We guarantee We will credit 
to the portion of Our Fixed Account securing the loan against the maximum loan  
interest rate of 4.0%, the maximum guaranteed net cost of the loans is 2.5%     
annually.

Suitability of the Contracts                                                    

Because of the surrender charge and other expenses, the contracts are not       
appropriate for short-term investment. In addition, the contracts may be most   
appropriate for those who have already made maximum use of other tax favored    
investment plans such as IRAs and 401(k) plans. The tax-deferred feature of the 
contracts is most favorable to those in high tax brackets. The tax-deferred     
feature is not necessary for a tax-qualified plan. In such instances, purchasers
should consider whether other features, such as the death benefit and lifetime  
annuity payments, make the contract appropriate for their purposes. Before      
purchasing a contract for use in a qualified plan, You should obtain competent  
advice both as to the tax treatment of the contract and the suitability of the  
investment.                                                                     

Death Benefit                                                                   

The MNL Advisor Variable Annuity contract pays a death benefit when the         
annuitant or owner dies before the maturity date if the contract is still       
inforce. The death benefit is equal to the greater of (a) the accumulation value
at the time We receive due Proof of death, an election of how the death benefit 
is to be paid, and any other documents or forms required or (b) net premiums.   
Premium taxes may be deducted from the death benefit proceeds.                  

If the annuitant or owner dies on or after the maturity date, then any remaining
guaranteed amounts, other than amounts payable to, or for the benefit of, the   
owner's surviving spouse, must be paid at least as rapidly as the benefits were 
being paid at the time of the death. Other rules relating to distributions at   
death apply to qualified contracts.                                             

Other Products                                                                  

We may offer other variable annuity contracts through Our Separate Account that 
also invest in some of the same portfolios. These contracts may have different  
charges and may offer different benefits. We encourage You to carefully consider
the costs and benefits of the contract to ensure that it is consistent with Your
personal investment goals and needs. To obtain more information about these

SEPARATE ACCOUNT C AND THE FUNDS

Our Separate Account And Its Investment Divisions                               

The "Separate Account" is the Midland National Life Separate Account C,         
established under the insurance laws of the State of South Dakota in March 1991 
and now governed by Iowa law. It is a unit investment trust registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of    
1940. This registration does not involve any SEC supervision of its management  
or investment contracts. The Separate Account has a number of investment        
divisions, each of which invests in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the  
funds. You may allocate part or all of Your premiums to any of the investment   
divisions of Our Separate Account available under this contract.                

The Funds                                                                       
Each of the 24 portfolios available under the contract is commonly called a     
mutual fund. Each one is a "series" of one of the following open-end diversified
investment companies:                                                           

(a)  American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.                           
(b)  Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund                          

Our Separate Account buys and sells the shares of each portfolio at net asset   
value (with no sales or surrender charge). More detailed information about the  
portfolios and their investment objectives, policies, risks, expenses and other 
aspects of their operations, appear in their prospectuses, which accompany this 
prospectus, and in the fund's Statements of Additional Information. You should  
read the portfolios' prospectuses carefully before allocating or transferring   
money to any portfolio.                                                         

We may from time to time receive revenue from the funds and/or from their       
managers. The amounts of the revenue, if any, may be substantial and may vary   
from portfolio to portfolio and may be based on the amount of Our investment in 
the funds. Currently these revenues range from 0.15% to 0.50% of Midland's      
investment in the funds.                                                        

Investment Policies Of The Funds' Portfolios                                    
Each portfolio tries to achieve a specified investment objective by following   
certain investment policies. No one can promise that any portfolio will meet its
investment objective. A portfolio's objectives and policies affect its returns  
and risks. Each investment division's performance depends on the experience of  
the corresponding portfolio. You bear the risk that the portfolios You have     
allocated amounts to will not meet their investment objectives. The objectives  
of the portfolios are as follows:

                                    in stocks that pay current dividends and show potential for capital appreciation.

VIP Growth Opportunities            Seeks capital growth by investing primarily in common stocks. Although the fund invests        
Portfolio                           primarily in common stocks, it has the ability to purchase other securities, including bonds,  
                                    which may be lower-quality debt securities.

                                    assets in companies the adviser believes have above-average growth potential.

                                    securities while also considering growth of capital. Contract owners should understand that    
                                    the fund's unit price may be volatile due to the nature of the high yield bond marketplace

*During extended periods of low interest rates, the yields of the money market  
investment divisions may become extremely low and possibly negative.            

American Century Investment Management, Inc. manages the American Century VP    
Portfolios. Fidelity Management & Research Company manages the VIP Portfolios.  

The funds may make a material change in their investment policies. In that case,
We will send You notice of the change. Within 60 days after You receive the     
notice, or within 60 days after the effective date of the change, if later, You 
may transfer any amount that You have in that investment division to another    
investment division. Such a transfer will not count as a transfer allowed after 
maturity, nor will it be counted for the purpose of determining whether a $15   
administration fee will be assessed (see "Transfers of Accumulation Value" on   
page 30).                                                                       

The funds sell their shares to Separate Accounts of various insurance companies 
to support both variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts, and to  
qualified retirement plans. We currently do not foresee any disadvantages to Our
contract owners arising from this use of the funds for mixed and shared funding.
The funds will monitor for possible conflicts arising out of this practice. If  
any such conflict or disadvantage does arise, We and/or the applicable Fund may 
take appropriate action to protect Your interests.                              

The Fund portfolios available under the contracts are not available for purchase
directly by the general public, and are not the same as the mutual funds with   
very similar or nearly identical names that are sold directly to the public.    
However, the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios are very      
similar to the investment objectives and policies of other (publicly available) 
mutual fund portfolios that have very similar or nearly identical names and that
are or may be managed by the same investment advisor or manager. Nevertheless,  
the investment performance and results of any of the funds' portfolios that are 
available under the contracts may be lower, or higher, than the investment      
results of such other (publicly available) portfolios. There can be no          
assurance, and no representation is made, that the investment results of any of 
the available portfolios will be comparable to the investment results of any    
other portfolio or mutual fund, even if the other portfolio or mutual fund has  
the same investment adviser or manager and the same investment objectives and   
policies and a very similar or nearly identical name.                           

Availability of the Portfolios                                                  
We cannot guarantee that each portfolio will always be available for investment 
through the contracts.                                                          

We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to make additions to, deletions
from, or substitutions for the shares of a portfolio that are held in the       
Separate Account. New or substitute portfolios may have different fees and      
expenses and their availability may be limited to certain classes of purchasers.
If the shares of a portfolio are no longer available for investment or if, in   
Our judgment, further investment in any portfolio should become inappropriate,  
We may redeem the shares of that portfolio, and substitute share of another     
portfolio. We will not substitute any shares without notice and prior approval  
of the SEC and state insurance authorities, to the extent required by the       
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or other applicable law.            

Amounts In Our Separate Account                                                 

The amount You have in each investment division is represented by the value of  
the accumulation units credited to Your accumulation value for that investment  
division. The value You have in an investment division is the accumulation unit 
value times the number of accumulation units credited to You. Amounts allocated,
transferred or added to the investment divisions are used to purchase           
accumulation units. Accumulation units of an investment division are purchased  
when You allocate net premiums or transfer amounts to that division.            
Accumulation units are sold or redeemed when You make a full or partial         
surrender or transfer amounts from an investment division, and to pay the death 
benefit when the annuitant or owner dies. We also redeem units to pay for       
certain charges.                                                                

We calculate the number of accumulation units purchased or redeemed in an       
investment division by dividing the dollar amount of the transaction by the     
investment division's accumulation unit value at the end of that day, if it is a
business day. If it is not a business day, We will use the unit value on the    
next business day. The number of accumulation units credited to You will not    
vary because of changes in accumulation unit values.                            

The accumulation units of each investment division have different accumulation  
unit values. We determine accumulation unit values for the investment divisions 
at the end of each business day. The accumulation unit value for each investment
division is initially set at $10.00. Accumulation unit values fluctuate with the
investment performance of the corresponding portfolios of the funds. They       
reflect investment income, the portfolios' realized and unrealized capital gains
and losses, and the funds' expenses. The accumulation unit values also reflect  
the daily asset charges We deduct from Our Separate Account at an effective     
annual rate of 1.55%. Additional information on the accumulation unit values is 
contained in the SAI.                                                           

We Own The Assets Of Our Separate Account                                       

We own the assets of Our Separate Account and use them to support Your contract 
and other variable annuity contracts. We may permit charges owed to Us to stay  
in the Separate Account. Thus, We may also participate proportionately in the   
Separate Account. These accumulated amounts belong to Us and We may transfer    
them from the Separate Account to Our Fixed Account. The assets in the Separate 
Account equal to the reserves and other liabilities of the Separate Account may 
not be charged with liabilities arising out of Our other business. The          
obligations under the contracts are Our obligations. The income, gains and      
losses (realized and unrealized) of the Separate Account are credited to or     
charged against the Separate Account without regard to Our other income, gains, 
or losses. Under certain unlikely circumstances, one investment division of the 
Separate Account may be liable for claims relating to the operations of another 
division.                                                                       

Our Right To Change How We Operate Our Separate Account                         

We have the right to modify how We operate the Separate Account. In making any  
changes, We may not seek approval of contract owners (unless approval is        
required by law). We have the right to:                                         

   o    add investment divisions to, or remove investment divisions from Our
Separate Account;                                           

o    combine two or more divisions within Our Separate Account;       

     o    withdraw assets relating to Our variable annuities from one investment
division and put them into another;                         

o    eliminate a portfolio's shares and substitute shares of another  
     portfolio of the funds or another open-end, registered investment
    company. This may happen if the portfolio's shares are no longer
          available for investment or, if in Our judgment, further investment in
    the portfolio is inappropriate in view of the Separate Account's
         purposes. However, if required, We would first seek approval from the
         Securities and Exchange Commission and, the insurance regulator where
the contract is delivered;                                  

o    end the registration of Our Separate Account under the Investment
Company Act of 1940;                                        

 o    operate Our Separate Account under the direction of a committee or
         discharge such a committee at any time (the committee may be composed
  entirely of "interested persons" of Midland National under the
Investment Company Act of 1940);                            

    o    disregard instructions from contract owners regarding a change in the
         investment objectives of the portfolio or the approval or disapproval
        of an investment advisory contract. (We would do so only if required
       by state insurance regulatory authorities, or otherwise pursuant to
insurance law or regulation); and                           

o    operate Our Separate Account or one or more of the investment    
     divisions in any other form the law allows, including a form that
        allows Us to make direct investments. In addition, We may disapprove
         any change in investment advisors or investment policies unless a law
or regulation provides differently.                         

If any changes are made that result in a material change in the underlying      
investments of any investment division, then You will be notified. We may, for  
example, cause the investment division to invest in a mutual fund other than or 
in addition to the current portfolios.                                          

You may want to transfer the amount in that investment division as a result of  
changes We have made. If You do wish to transfer the amount You have in that    
investment division to another division of Our Separate Account, or to Our Fixed
Account, then You may do so, without charge, by writing to Our Principal Office.
At the same time, You may also change how Your net premiums are allocated.      

 FIXED ACCOUNT

You may allocate some of Your accumulation value to the Fixed Account, subject  
to certain limitations described below. The Fixed Account pays interest at a    
declared rate. The current interest rate is 2.00% per year.                     

At the time of application, You may allocate up to 50% of the premium into the  
Fixed Account. For each subsequent premium deposit, You may allocate up to 50%  
of the premium deposit into the Fixed Account subject to the premium limits     
described below. The sum of premiums allocated to the Fixed Account prior to the
maturity date cannot exceed a maximum of $1,000,000 without prior Company       
approval. Each request to exceed this maximum will be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis.                                                                          

Your surrender value from the Fixed Account is guaranteed to be equal to or     
higher than 100% of the premium minus any surrender charges, partial surrenders,
transfers, or fees and expenses, accumulated at a guaranteed interest rate of at
least 1.5% per year.                                                            

The Fixed Account supports Our insurance and annuity obligations. Certain states
do not permit allocations to and transfers from the Fixed Account. Because of   
applicable exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in the Fixed Account
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and the Fixed Account
has not been registered as an investment company under the Investment Company   
Act of 1940. Accordingly, neither the Fixed Account nor any interests therein   
are generally subject to regulation under the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act. We have 
been advised that the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the disclosures that are
included in this prospectus which relate to the Fixed Account.                  

You may accumulate amounts in the Fixed Account by:                             

o    allocating net premiums,                                         

o    transferring amounts from the investment divisions, or           

o    earning interest on amounts You already have in the Fixed Account

Transfers, partial surrenders and allocated deductions reduce this amount. We   
reserve the right to limit the amount that, over the contract's life, You can   
allocate to the Fixed Account through allocating premiums and net transfers     
(amounts transferred in minus amounts transferred out).                         

You may transfer amounts among the investment divisions and between the Fixed   
Account and any investment divisions (subject to "Transfer Limitations" below). 

The total amount transferred out of the Fixed Account in any contract year is   
limited to 20% of the accumulation value in the Fixed Account at the beginning  
of the contract year. This limit does not apply to transfers made in a Dollar   
Cost Averaging or Portfolio Rebalancing program.                                

Transfers to and from the Fixed Account are included in the total number of     
transfers allowed in each contract year. Currently, You may make an unlimited   
number of transfers in each contract year prior to the maturity date (subject to
the Fixed Account transfer limitations described above). However, We reserve the
right to assess a $15 charge for each transfer after the 12th transfer in a     
contract year.                                                                  

The maximum increase to the Fixed Account in any contract year is limited to a  
total of $5,000, which cannot be exceeded without prior Company approval. The   
sum of new premiums allocated plus any amount transferred from the Separate     
Account to the Fixed Account cannot exceed a total of $5,000 in any contract    
year without prior Company approval. Each request to exceed this maximum will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis.                                               

You cannot allocate subsequent premiums to the Fixed Account if Your Fixed      
Account accumulation value is 50% or more of Your total accumulation value. You 
cannot make transfers from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account if Your    
Fixed Account accumulation value is 50% or more of Your total accumulation      
value.                                                                          

We pay interest on all Your amounts in the Fixed Account. Currently, We intend  
to declare interest rates in advance and guarantee these rates for one-year     
periods. You bear the risk that We will not credit interest above the 1.5%      
minimum. We have complete discretion regarding the rate of interest, if any,    
that We will credit above the minimum guaranteed rate on the Fixed Account,     
regardless of the investment performance of any part or all of Our Fixed Account
assets.                                                                         

The Fixed Account may not be available in all states. Your state of issue will  
determine if the Fixed Account is available on Your contract. Please check Your 
contract form to see if the Fixed Account is available on Your contract.        

Fixed Account Options                                                           

In addition to the permanent Fixed Account described above, there are other     
special Fixed Account options available. At the time of application only, You   
can choose to allocate a portion of Your initial premium to one of Our Fixed    
Account Options. These options are subject to all of the Fixed Account premium  
and transfer limitations described above. There are no charges for fees         
associated with the election of any of the fixed account options.               

Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG) Options                                              
You can choose to allocate some of Your initial premium to one or more of the   
Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG) Options available under this contract. Currently, We 
offer 4-year, 7-year, and 10-year guarantee periods. These options are only     
available at the time of application and only initial premium can be allocated. 
You can transfer money out of the MYG Options (subject to the Fixed Account     
transfer limitations and an interest adjustment) but You cannot transfer funds  
or allocate future premiums into the MYG Options.                               

If You do not withdraw or transfer the premium out of the MYG Options for the   
entire guarantee period(s) You select, We guarantee that We will credit a       
current interest rate declared for the entire length of the guarantee period(s).
The declared interest rate will be compounded and credited daily to equal an    
annual effective yield of the rate for each guarantee period. The current       
interest rates for new issues are 2.25% for the 4-year period, 2.50% for the    
7-year period, and 3.00% for the 10-year period. At the end of the guarantee    
period, the MYG Options are not renewable. The values will remain in Our Fixed  
Account and begin earning interest at the current interest rated declared for   
the Fixed Account unless You instruct Us otherwise.                             

We may make an interest adjustment from all amounts withdrawn from any MYG      
Account prior the end of the guarantee period (transfers, loans, annuitization, 
and surrender, including any free surrender amount). We will not make an        
interest adjustment upon the death of the owner or annuitant. The interest      
adjustment may result in a positive or negative adjustment to amounts           
surrendered, transferred or annuitized from the MYG options during the          
guaranteed period. The interest adjustment reflects changes in the interest     
rates declared by Midland National since the contract issue date. For each MYG  
option, the interest adjustment formula compares the interest rate at issue and 
the current declared interest rate as of the date the interest adjustment is    
calculated. The interest adjustment can either decrease or increase the amount  
to be received, depending upon whether there has been an increase or decrease in
declared interest rates, respectively. The interest adjustment will be          
applicable for the entire guarantee period You elect.                           

However, the MYG Options have a minimum guaranteed fund value, which is equal to
100% of premium payment(s) in the MYG Options minus any partial surrenders or   
transfers out of the MYG Options minus any fees and charges accumulated at an   
interest rate of 1.5%.                                                          

An Interest Adjustment, either positive or negative, will be limited to the     
difference between the MYG Option(s) accumulation value and the minimum         
guaranteed fund value.                                                          

Your surrender value from the MYG Options is guaranteed to be the greater of (a)
100% of premium payment(s) in the MYG Options minus any prior partial surrenders
or transfers out of the MYG Options plus the interest adjustment less surrender 
charges or (b) the minimum guaranteed fund value less surrender charges.        

If You choose to transfer all of Your funds out of the MYG Options, Your        
transfer amount is guaranteed to be equal to or higher than the minimum         
guaranteed fund value.                                                          

The MYG Options may not be available in all states. Your state of issue will    
determine if the MYG Options are available on Your contract. Please check Your  
contract form to see if the MYG Options are available on Your contract.         

Fixed Account Dollar Cost Averaging ("Fixed Account DCA")                       
At the time of Your application, You may elect one of two Fixed Account DCA     
programs. These programs allow You to have a specified amount of Your initial   
premium transferred each month to the investment divisions of Your choice (You  
cannot transfer from a DCA Account into a MYG Option). These programs may only  
be elected at issue. We may declare interest rates in excess of the guaranteed  
minimum rate for premiums in the Fixed Account DCA program. However, the amount 
of interest credited to the Fixed Account DCA Accounts will never be less than  
the minimum guaranteed rate of 1.5%. The interest rate will vary depending upon 
the Fixed Account DCA program You choose at the time You purchase the contract. 
You may choose one of the following two Fixed Account DCA programs:             

The 6-Month Fixed Account DCA program: Under this program, You allocate Your    
initial premium to the 6-Month DCA account and We will credit a guaranteed rate 
of interest on the diminishing balance of the premium remaining in the 6-Month  
DCA account for a six-month period beginning on the issue date. Transfers will  
occur each month over the six-month period with the final transfer including all
amounts remaining in the 6-Month DCA account.                                   

The 12-Month Fixed Account DCA program: Under this program, You allocate Your   
initial premium to the 12-Month DCA account and We will credit a guaranteed rate
of interest on the diminishing balance of the premium remaining in the 12-Month 
DCA account for a twelve-month period beginning on the issue date. Transfers    
will occur each month over the twelve-month period with the final transfer      
including all amounts remaining in the 12-Month DCA account.                    

Fixed Account Dollar Cost Averaging may not be available in all states. Your    
state of issue will determine if Fixed Account Dollar Cost Averaging is         
available on Your contract. Please check Your contract form to see if Fixed     
Account Dollar Cost Averaging is available on Your contract. In addition, We    
currently offer a dollar cost averaging program that can be elected at any time.
This program generally has more flexibility but lower interest rates. See       
"Dollar Cost Averaging"on page 36.                                              

 DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTRACT

Requirements for Issuance of a Contract                                         

To buy a contract, You must send Us an application form and an initial premium  
payment of at least $10,000, or $2,000 for a qualified contract. This sale must 
take place through a representative who is licensed and registered to sell the  
contract. Once We accept Your application, You will be issued a contract that   
sets forth precisely Your rights and Our obligations. Additional premium        
payments, of at least $50 may then be made payable to Midland National and      
mailed to the Principal Office. If Your application is complete, then We will   
accept or reject it within two business days of receipt. If the application is  
incomplete, then We will attempt to complete it within five business days. If it
is not complete at the end of this period (or cannot be accepted for some other 
reason), then We will inform You of the reason for delay and the premium payment
will be returned immediately unless You let Us keep the premium until the       
application is complete. Your initial premium is held in Our suspense account   
until Your contract is issued or Your premium is refunded.                      

We will allocate Your initial premium payment according to Your instructions if 
We receive it or accept Your application (whichever is later) at Our Principal  
Office before the New York Stock Exchange closes for regular trading (usually,  
3:00 p.m. Central Time). We will then price the accumulation units purchased    
with Your premium payment at the unit value determined at the close of that     
regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange. If We receive Your      
initial premium payment or accept Your application (whichever is later) after   
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, We will credit     
accumulation units at the unit value determined at the close of the next regular
trading session of the New York Stock Exchange.                                 

There may be delays in Our receipt of applications that are outside of Our      
control because of the failure of the selling agent to forward the application  
to Us promptly, or because of delays in determining that the contract is        
suitable for You. Any such delays will affect when Your contract can be issued  
and when Your premium payment is allocated among Our Fixed Account and/or       
investment divisions of Our Separate Account.                                   

We offer variable annuity contracts that have different death benefits, contract
features, and optional benefits. However, these other contracts also have       
different charges that would affect Your investment performance and accumulation
value. To obtain more information about these other contracts, contact Our      
Principal Office.                                                               

Free Look                                                                       

You generally have a 10-day Free Look period after You receive Your contract.   
You may review it and decide whether to keep or cancel it. If You cancel the    
contract, then You must return it to the agent who sold it to You or to Our     
Principal Office. If You cancel Your contract, then We will return:             

1.   the accumulation value, or                                       

2.   if greater and if required by law, the full premium payment.     

The length of the Free Look period may vary in certain states in compliance with
specific regulations and legal requirements. The accumulation value will reflect
both the positive and negative investment performance of the investment         
divisions of Our Separate Account chosen by You in the contract application.    

Tax-Free "Section 1035" Exchanges                                               

You can generally exchange one annuity contract for another in a "tax-free      
exchange" under the Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code. Before making an 
exchange, You should compare both annuities carefully. Remember that if You     
exchange another annuity for the one described in this prospectus, You might    
have to pay a surrender charge on Your old annuity, and there will be a new     
surrender charge period for this contract and other charges may be higher (or   
lower) and the benefits may be different. You should not exchange another       
annuity for this one unless You determine, after knowing all the facts, that the
exchange is in Your best interest and not just better for the person trying to  
sell You this contract (that person will generally earn a commission if You buy 
this contract through an exchange or otherwise).                                

Allocation of Premium Payments                                                  

You will specify Your desired premium allocation on the contract's application  
form. Your instructions in Your application will dictate how to allocate Your   
premiums. Allocation percentages may be any whole number (from 0 to 100) and the
sum must equal 100. The allocation instructions in Your application will apply  
to all other premiums You pay, unless You change subsequent premium allocations 
by providing Us with written instructions. We reserve the right to limit the    
number of investment divisions in which You can have funds invested. In certain 
states, allocations to and transfers from the Fixed Account are not permitted.  

Changing Your Premium Allocation Percentages                                    
You may change the allocation percentages of Your premiums by writing to Our    
Principal Office and telling Us what changes You wish to make. These changes    
will effect transactions as of the date We receive Your request at Our Principal
Office. Changing Your allocation instructions will not change the way Your      
existing accumulation value is apportioned among the investment divisions or the
Fixed Account. While the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) program is in effect, the  
allocation percentages that apply to any premiums received will be the DCA      
allocation percentages unless You specify otherwise. (See "Dollar Cost
Averaging" on page 34).                                                         

Your Accumulation Value                                                         

Your accumulation value is the sum of Your amounts in the Fixed Account and the 
various investment divisions. Your accumulation value reflects the investment   
performance of the portfolios in the investment divisions, any premium payments 
made, any surrenders, any transfers, loans, withdrawals, and any charges        
assessed in connection with the contract. There is no guaranteed minimum        
accumulation value. Transaction and surrender charges are made on the effective 
date of the transaction. Charges against Our Separate Account are reflected     
daily.                                                                          

We guarantee amounts allocated to the Fixed Account. Your accumulation value in 
the Fixed Account will be reduced by the contract fees and charges We deduct and
the effects of any contract transactions (loans, surrenders, and transfers) on  
Your accumulation value in the Fixed Account. There is no guaranteed minimum    
accumulation value for amounts allocated to the investment divisions of Our     
Separate Account. You bear the investment risk. An investment division's        
performance will cause Your accumulation value to go up or down.                

Transfers of Accumulation Value                                                 

You generally may transfer amounts among the investment divisions and between   
the Fixed Account and any investment division prior to maturity date. The amount
that You can transfer into or out of the Fixed Account is limited. Transfers out
of the MYG Options of the Fixed account are subject to an interest adjustment.  
See "FIXED ACCOUNT" on page 25 and "Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG) Options" on page 
26 for details. Currently, You may make an unlimited number of transfers of     
accumulation value in each contract year prior to the maturity date (subject to 
the "Transfer Limitations" below). However, We reserve the right to assess a $15
charge for each transfer after the 12th transfer in a contract year.            

The minimum transfer amount is $200 or 100% of an investment division if less   
than $200. The minimum amount does not have to come from or be transferred to   
just one investment division. The only requirement is that the total amount     
transferred that day equals the transfer minimum. Completed transfer requests   
received at Our Principal Office before the New York Stock Exchange closes for  
regular trading (usually, 3:00 p.m. Central Time) are priced at the unit value  
determined at the close of that regular trading session of the New York Stock   
Exchange. If We receive Your completed transfer after the close of regular      
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, We will process the transfer request at 
the unit value determined at the close of the next regular trading session of   
the New York Stock Exchange. For information regarding telephone or facsimile   
requests, see "Inquiries" on page 19. For limitations on transfers to and from  
the Fixed Account, see "FIXED ACCOUNT" on page 25.                              

After the maturity date, You can make only two transfers per contract year and  
only among the investment divisions of the Separate Account.                    

We reserve the right to eliminate and/or severely restrict the transfer         
privilege in any manner We deem appropriate for some, all or specific contract  
owners.                                                                         

Transfer Limitations                                                            

Frequent, large, programmed, or short-term transfers among investment divisions,
such as those associated with "market timing" transactions, can adversely affect
the portfolios and the returns achieved by contract owners. In particular, such 
transfers may dilute the value of the portfolios' shares, interfere with the    
efficient management of the portfolios' investments, and increase brokerage and 
administrative costs of the portfolios. In order to try to protect Our contract 
owners and the portfolios from potentially harmful trading activity, We have    
implemented certain market timing policies and procedures (the "market timing   
procedures"). Our market timing procedures are designed to detect and prevent   
frequent or short-term transfer activity among the investment divisions of the  
Separate Account that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolio   
shareholders.                                                                   

More specifically, currently Our market timing procedures are intended to detect
potentially harmful trading or transfer activity by monitoring for any two      
interfund transfer requests on a contract within a five business Day period, in 
which the requests are moving to and from identical subaccounts (for example, a 
transfer from American Century VP International Portfolio to Fidelity Money     
Market Portfolio, followed by a transfer from Fidelity Money Market Portfolio   
back to American Century VP International Portfolio within five business days). 

We will review transfer requests, daily blotters, and transaction logs in an    
attempt to identify transfers that exceed these transfer parameters. When We    
identify a second trade within five days of the first, We will review those     
transfers (and other transfers in the same contract) to determine if, in Our    
judgment, the transfers are part of a market timing strategy or otherwise have  
the potential to be harmful. We will honor and process the second transfer      
request, but if We believe that the activity is potentially harmful, We will    
suspend that contract's transfer privileges and We will not accept another      
transfer request for 14 business days. We will attempt to inform the contract   
owner (or Registered Representative) by telephone that their transfers have been
deemed potentially harmful to others and that their transfer privilege is       
suspended for 14 days. If We do not succeed in reaching the contract owner or   
Registered Representative by phone, We will send a letter by first class mail to
the contract owner's address of record.                                         

In addition to Our own market timing procedures, managers of the investment     
portfolios might contact Us if they believe or suspect that there is market     
timing or other potentially harmful trading, and, if so, We will take           
appropriate action to protect others. In particular, We may, and We reserve the 
right to, reverse a potentially harmful transfer. If so, We will inform the     
contract owner and/or Registered Representative.                                

In Our sole discretion, We may revise Our market timing procedures at any time  
without prior notice as We deem necessary or appropriate to better detect and   
deter frequent, programmed, large, or short-term transfers that may adversely   
affect other contract owners or portfolio shareholders, to comply with state or 
federal regulatory requirements, or to impose additional or alternate           
restrictions on market timers (such as dollar or percentage limits on           
transfers). We may change Our parameters to monitor for a different number of   
transfers with different time periods, and We may include other factors, such as
the size of transfers made by contract owners within given periods of time, as  
well as the number of "round trip" transfers into and out of particular         
investment divisions. For purposes of applying the parameters used to detect    
potential market timing and other potentially harmful activity, We may aggregate
transfers made in two or more contracts that We believe are connected (for      
example, two contracts with the same owner, or owned by spouses, or owned by    
different partnerships or corporations that are under common control, etc.).    

We do not include transfers made pursuant to the dollar cost averaging programs,
and portfolio rebalancing program in these limitations. We may vary Our market  
timing procedures from investment division to investment division, and may be   
more restrictive with regard to certain investment divisions than others. We may
not always apply these detections methods to investment divisions investing in  
portfolios that, in Our judgment, would not be particularly attractive to market
timers or otherwise susceptible to harm by frequent transfers.                  

We reserve the right to place restrictions on the methods of implementing       
transfers for some or all contract owners that We believe might otherwise engage
in trading activity that is harmful to others. For example, We might only accept
transfers by original "wet" contract owner signature conveyed through the U.S.  
mail (that is, We can refuse transfer requests submitted by phone, facsimile,   
e-mail or by any other electronic means). We also reserve the right to implement
and administer redemption fees imposed by one or more of the portfolios in the  
future.                                                                         

Contract owners seeking to engage in frequent, programmed, large, or short-term 
transfer activity may deploy a variety of strategies to avoid detection. Our    
ability to detect and deter such transfer activity is limited by operational    
systems and technological limitations. In addition, the terms of the contract   
may also limit Our ability to restrict or deter harmful transfers. Furthermore, 
the identification of contract owners determined to be engaged in transfer      
activity that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolios'         
shareholders involves judgments that are inherently subjective. Accordingly,    
despite Our best efforts, We cannot guarantee that Our market timing procedures 
will detect every potential market timer, but We apply Our market timing        
procedures consistently to all contract owners without special arrangement,     
waiver, or exception. We may vary Our market timing procedures among Our other  
variable insurance products to account for differences in various factors, such 
as operational systems and contract provisions. In addition, because other      
insurance companies and/or retirement plans may invest in the portfolios, We    
cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not suffer harm from frequent,        
programmed, large, or short-term transfers among investment divisions of        
variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among investment      
options available to retirement plan participants.                              

To the extent permitted by applicable law, We reserve the right to defer the    
transfer privilege at any time that We are unable to purchase or redeem shares  
of any of the portfolios available through Separate Account C, including any    
refusal or restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares as a result  
of their own policies and procedures on market timing activities or other       
potentially abusive transfers. You should read the prospectuses of the          
portfolios for more details on their ability to refuse or restrict purchases or 
redemptions of their shares.                                                    

Surrenders                                                                      

You may withdraw all or part of Your surrender value by sending Us a written    
request at Our Principal Office. The surrender value is the Separate Account    
accumulation value plus Fixed Account accumulation value (adjusted for an       
interest adjustment if applicable), minus any applicable surrender charges and  
annual maintenance fee. In some states a premium tax charge may also be         
deducted. (Surrenders may be restricted by a retirement plan under which You are
covered.) Partial surrenders from an investment division or the Fixed Account   
must be made in amounts of $500 or more (except for systematic withdrawals      
described below) and cannot reduce Your accumulation value to less than $500. If
a partial surrender results in less than $500 remaining, then the entire        
accumulation value must be withdrawn. For a full surrender, You must send in    
Your contract with Your surrender request.                                      

Any applicable surrender charge and any required tax withholding will be        
deducted from the amount paid. Any portion of the Fixed Account accumulation    
value allocated to the MYG Options may be subject to an interest adjustment. In 
addition, upon full surrender an annual maintenance fee (and possibly a premium 
tax charge) may be subtracted.                                                  

Completed surrender requests received at Our Principal Office before the New    
York Stock Exchange closes for regular trading (usually 3:00 p.m. Central Time) 
are priced at the unit value determined at the close of that regular trading    
session of the New York Stock Exchange. If We receive Your completed surrender  
request after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, We   
will process the surrender request at the unit value determined at the close of 
the next regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange.                

We will generally pay the surrender amount from the Separate Account within     
seven days after We receive a properly completed surrender request in good      
order. We may defer payment for a longer period only when:                      

     o    trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted as defined by the
SEC;                                                        

  o    the New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend
and holiday closing);                                       

o    an emergency exists as defined by the SEC as a result of which   
         disposal of the Separate Account's securities or determination of the
 net asset value of each investment division is not reasonably
practicable; or                                             

o    for such other periods as the SEC may by order permit for the    
protection of owners.                                       

See "When We Pay Proceeds From This Contract" on page 56.                       

If We defer payment for 30 or more days, then during the period of deferment, We
will pay interest at the rate required by the jurisdiction in which this        
contract is delivered.                                                          

We expect to pay the surrender amount from the Fixed Account promptly, but We   
have the right to delay payment for up to six months.                           

Unless You specify otherwise, Your partial surrender will be allocated among all
investment divisions and the Fixed Account (excluding the Fixed Account DCA and 
MYG options) in the same proportion as Your accumulation value bears to each    
investment division and the Fixed Account. This allocation is subject to minimum
amount requirements.                                                            

The surrender charge will be determined without reference to the source of the  
partial surrender. The charge will be based on the length of time between       
premium payments and surrenders. (See "CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS" on page    
41.)                                                                            

A surrender will generally have Federal income tax consequences that can include
income tax penalties and tax withholding. You should consult Your tax advisor   
before making a surrender. (See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 44.)               

Surrenders may be restored under certain types of qualified contracts. If       
allowed, the restoration will be effective as of the date that surrender        
proceeds are returned to Midland National. Under certain types of retirement    
arrangements, the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 provides that, in the case of a 
married participant, a surrender request must include the consent of the        
participant's spouse. This consent must contain the participant's signature and 
the notarized or properly witnessed signature of the participant's spouse. These
spousal consent requirements generally apply to married participants in most    
qualified pension plans, including plans for self-employed individuals that are 
considered employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income  
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). You should check the terms of Your retirement plan
and consult with a tax advisor before making a surrender. (See "FEDERAL TAX
STATUS" on page 44.)                                                            

Loans                                                                           

Loans are only available if You purchase this contract in connection with a     
qualified plan under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. After the     
first contract anniversary and prior to the maturity date, owners of contracts  
issued in connection with Section 403(b) qualified plans may request a loan     
using the contract as security for the loan. Only one loan may be outstanding at
any time. Loans are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the  
terms of the retirement program. You should consult a tax advisor before        
requesting a loan.                                                              

Only one loan can be made within a 12-month period. The loan amount must be at  
least $2,000.                                                                   

Such loan, when added to the outstanding balance of loans from this contract or 
other contracts maintained by the employee, will be limited to the lesser of the
following:                                                                      

(a) $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of:                                  
(i)  the highest outstanding balance of loans from this contract        
or other contracts maintained by the employee during the one  
year period ending on the day before the date on which the    
loan is made; over                                            
(ii) the outstanding balance of loans from this contract or other       
contracts maintained by the employee on the date which such   
loan is made; or                                              
(b) the greater of:                                                             
(i)  one half of the present value of the nonforfeitable cash surrender 
value of this contract; or                                    
(ii) $10,000.                                                           

The portion of the accumulation value that is equal to the loan amount will be  
held in the Fixed Account and will earn interest at the Fixed Account minimum   
interest rate of 1.5% per year. You should tell Us how much of the loan You want
taken from Your unloaned amount in the Fixed Account, or from the Separate      
Account investment divisions. If You do not tell Us how to allocate Your loan,  
the loan will be allocated among all investment divisions and the Fixed Account 
(excluding the Fixed Account DCA and MYG options) in the same proportion as the 
value of Your interest in each division bears to Your total accumulation value. 
We will redeem units from each investment division equal in value to the amount 
of the loan allocated to that investment division and transfer that amount to   
the Fixed Account. A loan taken from values allocated to the multi-guarantee    
options will be subject to an interest adjustment.                              

We charge interest on loans at the rate of 4.0% per year in arrears. Loan       
interest is due at the end of each quarter. Unpaid interest will be added to the
loan and accrue interest. If the total loan plus loan interest equals or exceeds
the accumulation value minus any applicable surrender charges, then the contract
will terminate with no further value. In such case, We will give You at least 31
days written notice. Termination under these circumstances may adversely affect 
the treatment of the contract under the Internal Revenue Code section 403(b).   

The total loan plus loan interest will be deducted from any amount applied under
a payment option or otherwise payable under the contract.                       

The loan agreement will describe the amount, duration, and restrictions on the  
loan. In general, loans must be repaid in monthly or quarterly installments     
within 5 years. If a quarterly installment is not received by the end of the    
calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the payment was due,   
then a deemed distribution of the entire amount of the outstanding loan         
principal, interest due, and any applicable charges under the contract,         
including any withdrawal charge, will be made. This deemed distribution may be  
subject to income and penalty tax under the Internal Revenue Code and may       
adversely affect the treatment of the contract under the Internal Revenue Code  
section 403(b).                                                                 

A loan has a permanent effect on the accumulation value because the investment  
experience of the investment divisions will apply only to the unborrowed portion
of the accumulation value. The longer the loan is outstanding, the greater the  
effect is likely to be. The effect could be favorable or unfavorable. If the net
investment results are greater than 1.5% per year while the loan is outstanding,
then the accumulation value will not increase as rapidly as it would have if no 
debt were outstanding. If net investment results are below 1.5% per year, then  
the accumulation value will be higher than it would have been had no loan been  
outstanding. In addition, a loan costs You a net interest charge of 2.5% per    
year.                                                                           

Dollar Cost Averaging                                                           

The Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) program enables You to make monthly or quarterly
transfers of a predetermined dollar amount from the DCA source account (any     
investment division or the Fixed Account) into one or more of the investment    
divisions (You cannot transfer from a DCA Account into the MYG Options). This   
Dollar Cost Averaging program has more flexibility then the Fixed Account DCA,  
described above, but generally pays a lower rate of interest. This program may  
reduce the impact of market fluctuations by allocating monthly or quarterly, as 
opposed to allocating the total amount at one time. This plan of investing does 
not insure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets. The minimum 
monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred using DCA is $200.                

You can elect the DCA program at any time. Only one active DCA account is       
allowed at a time. You must complete the proper request forms and send them to  
Our Principal Office, and there must be a sufficient amount in the DCA source   
account. You can get a sufficient amount by paying a premium with the DCA       
request form, allocating premiums, or transferring amounts to the DCA source    
account. Copies of the DCA request form can be obtained by contacting Us at Our 
Principal Office. The election will specify:                                    

o    the DCA source account from which transfers will be made,        

 o    that any money received with the form is to be placed into the DCA
source account,                                             

   o    the total monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred to the other
investment divisions, and                                   

o    how that monthly or quarterly amount is to be allocated among the
investment divisions.                                       

 o    The DCA request form must be received with any premium payment You
intend to apply to DCA.                                     

Once You elect DCA, additional premiums can be deposited into the DCA source    
account by sending them in with a DCA request form. All amounts in the DCA      
source account will be available for transfer under the DCA program.            

Any premium payments received while the DCA program is in effect will be        
allocated using the allocation percentages from the DCA request form, unless You
specify otherwise. You may change the DCA allocation percentages or DCA transfer
amounts twice during a contract year.                                           

If it is requested when the contract is issued, then DCA will start at the      
beginning of the second contract month. If it is requested after issue, then DCA
will start at the beginning of the next contract month after the request is     
received.                                                                       

If a DCA program is elected after issue and the source account is the Fixed     
Account, the minimum number of months for the program is 12 months.             

We will process DCA transfers for a maximum of 24 months. You may continue to   
participate in the DCA program beyond the 24 month period by providing Us with  
written authorization at the end of each 24 month time period. DCA automatically
terminates on the maturity date.                                                

You may stop the DCA program at any time by sending Us written notice. We       
reserve the right to end the DCA program by sending You one month's written     
notice.                                                                         

We do not charge any specific fees for You to participate in a DCA program.     
While We currently do not charge for transfers, We do reserve the right to      
charge $15 for each transfer after the 12th in any contract year. However,      
initiating a DCA program will only count once in determining the $15 charge for 
each transfer after the 12th in a contract year.                                

Portfolio Rebalancing                                                           

The Portfolio Rebalancing option allows contract owners, who are not Dollar Cost
Averaging, to reset the percentage of accumulation value allocated to each      
investment division to a pre-set percentage level on a monthly, quarterly,      
semi-annual, or annual basis. If You elect this option, then on the contract    
"anniversary date" each month or quarter, We will transfer the amounts needed to
"rebalance" the accumulation value to Your most recent specified percentages.   
All rebalancing transfers will include allocations to the Fixed Account but will
not include allocations to the MYG Options. Rebalancing may result in           
transferring amounts from an investment division earning a relatively high      
return to one earning a relatively low return.                                  

Portfolio Rebalancing will remain in effect until We receive Your written       
termination request. We reserve the right to end the Portfolio Rebalancing      
option by sending You one month's notice. Contact Us at Our Principal Office to 
elect the Portfolio Rebalancing option.                                         

There is no charge for Portfolio Rebalancing and a Portfolio Rebalancing        
transfer is not considered a transfer for purposes of possibly assessing a      
transfer charge.                                                                

Fixed Account Earnings Sweep Program                                            

You may elect to have any Fixed Account interest earnings transferred on a      
monthly or quarterly basis to one or more of the Separate Account investment    
divisions. Interest earned on funds allocated to the MYG Options in the Fixed   
Account cannot be included in the Fixed Account Earnings Sweep program.         

Transfers will be made on the contract anniversary day each month or quarter to 
the investment divisions You select or according to the DCA program. While this 
program is active, You may not allocate future premium payments to the Fixed    
Account. Amounts transferred out of the Fixed Account due to an earnings sweep  
transfer are counted toward the 20% of Fixed Account accumulation value that may
be transferred out of the Fixed Account during any contract year.               

The Fixed Account Earnings Sweep program may not be available in all states.    
Your state of issue will determine if The Fixed Account Earnings Sweep program  
is available on Your contract.                                                  

There is no charge for Fixed Account Earnings Sweeps program and a Fixed Account
Earnings Sweep transfer is not considered a transfer for purposes of possibly   
assessing a transfer charge.                                                    

Systematic Withdrawals                                                          

The Systematic Withdrawal feature allows You to have a portion of the           
accumulation value withdrawn automatically. These payments can be made only: (1)
while the annuitant is living, (2) before the maturity date, and (3) after the  
Free Look period. This feature cannot be used for amounts allocated to the MYG  
Options or the DCA Options in the Fixed Account. You may elect this option by   
sending a properly completed Preauthorized Systematic Withdrawal Request Form to
Our Principal Office. You may designate the systematic withdrawal amount or the 
period for systematic withdrawal payments. You will also designate the desired  
frequency of the systematic withdrawals, which may be monthly, quarterly,       
semi-annually or annually. See Your contract for details on systematic          
withdrawal options and when each begins.                                        

If the New York Stock Exchange is closed for regular trading on the day when the
withdrawal is to be made, then We will process Your withdrawal at the unit value
determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the New York     
Stock Exchange. The deduction caused by the systematic withdrawal will be       
allocated proportionately to Your accumulation value in the investment divisions
and the Fixed Account.                                                          

You can stop or modify the systematic withdrawals by sending Us a written       
request. A proper written request must include the consent of any effective     
assignee or irrevocable beneficiary, if applicable.                             

Each systematic withdrawal must be at least $200. We reserve the right to change
the frequency of payments or discontinue payments if the payment is less than   
$200. Upon payment, We reduce Your accumulation value by an amount equal to the 
payment proceeds plus any applicable surrender charge. (See "Surrender Charges
on Surrenders" on page 41). The surrender charge applies to systematic          
withdrawals in excess of the free surrender amount in the same manner as it     
applies to other partial surrenders, with the exception that, a portion of the  
free surrender amount can be received more than once per year, as long as the   
full 10% of Your gross premiums has not been withdrawn.                         

Under Midland National's current Company practice, systematic withdrawals taken 
to satisfy IRS required minimum distribution rules and paid under a life        
expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge. We reserve the     
right to change this practice in the future. Any systematic withdrawal that     
would equal or exceed the surrender value will be treated as a complete         
surrender. In no event will the payment of a systematic withdrawal exceed the   
surrender value. The contract will automatically terminate if a systematic      
withdrawal causes the contract's surrender value to equal zero.                 

To the extent, if any, that there is gain in the contract, systematic           
withdrawals generally are included in the contract owner's gross income for tax 
purposes in the year in which the withdrawal occurs, and may be subject to a    
penalty tax of 10% before age 59 1/2. Additional terms and conditions for the   
systematic withdrawal program are set forth in Your contract and in the         
application for the program.                                                    

Free Surrender Amount                                                           

You may withdraw up to 10% of Your gross premiums (sum of all premiums paid,    
determined on the date of the surrender request) once each contract year without
incurring a surrender charge in each contract year. If this option is not       
exercised or if less than 10% is withdrawn, any unused amount will not be       
carried over to a subsequent contract year and, generally, will not be carried  
over to a subsequent withdrawal in the same contract year. However, by current  
Company practice, We will allow multiple free withdrawals up to 10% of gross    
premiums each contract year. This is not guaranteed. The value of 10% of the    
gross premiums is determined on the date of the first partial surrender. An     
interest adjustment may be deducted from any premium withdrawn from the MYG     
Options prior to the end of the guarantee period. For more information, see     
"Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG) Options" on page 26. A withdrawal may have Federal  
income tax consequences that can include income tax penalties and tax           
withholding. (See "FEDERAL TAX STATUS" on page 44.)                             

Death Benefit                                                                   

If the annuitant or an owner dies before the maturity date and while the        
contract is still inforce, We will pay the death benefit to the beneficiary once
We receive (at Our Principal Office) satisfactory proof of the annuitant's or   
owner's death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid, and any other
documents or forms required. You can name different beneficiaries for           
annuitant's and owner's death.                                                  

If the annuitant, who is not an owner, dies prior to the maturity date, the     
death benefit (paid to the annuitant's beneficiary) must be paid within one year
of the annuitant's death. For joint annuitants the death benefit is paid upon   
the second death.                                                               

If an owner dies prior to the maturity date, then the death benefit (paid to the
owner's beneficiary) must be paid within 5 years of the owner's death (other    
than amounts payable to, or for the benefit of, the surviving spouse of the     
owner). For joint owners the death benefit is paid upon the first death. The    
value of the death benefit, as described below, will be determined based on the 
accumulation value on the business Day that Our Principal Office receives proof 
of death, an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other      
documents or forms required.                                                    

Unless a payment option is selected and all other required forms and            
documentation are received within 90 days after We receive proof of death, the  
death benefit will be paid as a lump sum calculated as of that date.            

When a death benefit is paid on the death of the annuitant and a payment option 
is selected within 60 days after the annuitant's death, the payment option must 
be an annuity for the life of the payee or for a period extending no longer than
the payee's life expectancy, and payments must begin within one year of the date
of death.                                                                       

When a death benefit is paid on the death of an owner or a joint owner and a    
payment option is selected, the payment option must be an annuity for the life  
of the payee or for a period extending no longer than the payee's life          
expectancy, and payments must begin within one year of the date of death.       

If the annuitant or owner dies on or after the maturity date, then any remaining
amounts, other than amounts payable to, or for the benefit of, the owner's      
surviving spouse, must be paid at least as rapidly as the benefits were being   
paid at the time of the owner's death. Other rules relating to distributions at 
death apply to qualified contracts.                                             

If joint owners or joint annuitants die within 24 hours of one another, they are
considered to have died simultaneously and the eldest is presumed to have died  
first. In the event of simultaneous death of the owner and the annuitant, the   
owner is presumed to have died first, and the owner's beneficiary would be paid 
the death benefit.                                                              

The death benefit paid to the beneficiary will be the greatest of:              

     (a)  the accumulation value when We receive due proof of death, an election
         of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other documentation or
forms required; or                                          

(b)  100% of the total net premium payments made to Your contract.    

If the annuitant or owner dies on or after the maturity date, We will pay any   
remaining guaranteed payments to the beneficiary as provided in the annuity     
option selected.                                                                

Naming different persons as owner and annuitant can affect whether the death    
benefit is payable, the amount of the benefit, and who will receive it. Use care
when naming owners, annuitants, and beneficiaries, and consult Your registered  
representative if You have questions.                                           

Premium taxes may be deducted from the death benefit proceeds.                  

Payment of Death Benefits                                                       

In most cases, when a death benefit is paid in a lump sum, We will pay the death
benefit by establishing an interest bearing account, called the "Midland Access 
Account" for the beneficiary, in the amount of the death benefit. We will send  
the beneficiary a checkbook, and the beneficiary will have access to the account
simply by writing a check for all or any part of the amount of the death        
benefit. The Midland Access Account is part of Our Fixed Account. It is not a   
bank account and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency.  
As part of Our Fixed Account, it is subject to the claims of Our creditors. We  
receive a benefit from all amounts left in the Midland Access Account.          

CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS

Surrender Charges on Surrenders                                                 

We may deduct a surrender charge from any full or partial surrender (including a
surrender to effect an annuity and on systematic withdrawals) that exceeds the  
free surrender amount. This charge partially reimburses Us for the selling and  
distributing costs of this contract. These include commissions and the costs of 
preparing sales literature and printing prospectuses. If the surrender charge is
insufficient to cover all distribution expenses, then the deficiency will be met
from Our surplus that may be, in part, derived from mortality and expense risks 
charges (described below). For the purpose of determining the surrender charge, 
any amount that You withdraw will be treated as being from premiums first, and  
then from investment income, if any (and without regard to allocations of       
premiums or surrenders among investment divisions). Premium payments are        
considered withdrawn in the order that they were received. There is no surrender
charge on the investment income (if any) withdrawn.                             

The length of time between each premium payment and surrender determines the    
amount of the surrender charge.                                                 

The charge is a percentage of the premiums withdrawn and equals:                

Length of Time from                                             
Premium Payment               Surrender                     
(number of years)                Charge                       
-----------------                ------                       
1                          9%                 
2                          8%                 
3                          7%                 
4                          6%                 
5+                         0%                 

At the time of withdrawal, if Your accumulation value is less than Your net     
premium, the surrender charge will still be assessed against the full remaining 
net premium amount.                                                             

Under Midland National's current Company practice, amounts withdrawn under the  
contract to comply with IRS minimum distribution rules and paid under a life    
expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge. We reserve the     
right to change this practice in the future. Amounts withdrawn to comply with   
IRS minimum distribution rules will reduce the amount available under the free  
surrender amount.                                                               

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge                                               

We deduct a daily charge for mortality and expense risks at an effective annual 
rate to 1.55% of the accumulation values in the Separate Account until the      
maturity date if You have selected an annuity option offering fixed payments or 
interest. If You have selected a variable annuity option, We will continue to   
assess this charge after the maturity date. This charge compensates Us for      
assuming certain mortality and expense risks. No mortality and expense charge is
deducted from the Fixed Account. The investment division's accumulation unit    
values and annuity Unit values reflect this charge. We expect to profit from    
this charge. We may use the profit for any purpose including paying distribution
expenses. However, the level of this charge is guaranteed for the life of the   
contract and may not be increased.                                              

The mortality risk We bear arises, in part, from our obligation to make monthly 
annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual may    
live. These payments are guaranteed in accordance with the annuity tables and   
other provisions contained in Your contract. This assures You that neither the  
longevity of the annuitant, nor an unanticipated improvement in general life    
expectancy, will have any adverse effect on the monthly annuity payments the    
annuitant will receive under the contract. Our obligation, therefore, relieves  
the annuitant from the risk that he or she will outlive the funds accumulated   
for retirement. The mortality risk also arises, in part, because of the risk    
that the death benefit may be greater than the accumulation value. We also      
assume the risk that other expense charges may be insufficient to cover the     
actual expenses We incur.                                                       

Annual Maintenance Fee                                                          

We deduct an annual maintenance fee of $30 on each contract anniversary on or   
before the maturity date. We reserve the right to increase this charge, however,
it will not exceed $60 per contract year. Currently, We waive the annual        
maintenance fee for Section 403(b), SEP-IRA, and 457 Qualified Plans or if Your 
net premium is $50,000 or more on the contract anniversary. This charge is for  
Our record keeping and other expenses incurred in maintaining the contracts. At 
the end of each contract year We deduct this charge proportionally from each    
investment division and the Fixed Account. If the contract is surrendered during
a contract year and the net premium is less than $50,000, then We will deduct   
the full annual maintenance fee for the current contract year at that time. We  
will not deduct the annual maintenance fee in the event of annuitization or     
death.                                                                          

We may reduce the annual maintenance fee for contracts issued in a manner that  
results in a savings of administrative expenses. The amount of reductions will  
be considered on a case-by-case basis and reflect Our expected reductions in    
administrative expenses.                                                        

Interest Adjustment                                                             

We may make an interest adjustment from all amounts withdrawn from any MYG      
Account prior the end of the guarantee period (transfers, loans, annuitization, 
and surrender, including any free surrender amount). We will not make an        
interest adjustment upon the death of the owner or annuitant. The interest      
adjustment may result in a positive or negative adjustment to amounts           
surrendered, transferred or annuitized from the MYG options during the          
guaranteed period. The interest adjustment reflects changes in the interest     
rates declared by Midland National since the contract issue date. For each MYG  
option, the interest adjustment formula compares the interest rate at issue and 
the current declared interest rate as of the date the interest adjustment is    
calculated. The interest adjustment can either decrease or increase the amount  
to be received, depending upon whether there has been an increase or decrease in
declared interest rates, respectively. The interest adjustment will be          
applicable for the entire guarantee period You elect.                           

An Interest Adjustment, either positive or negative, will be limited to the     
difference between the MYG Option(s) accumulation value and the minimum         
guaranteed fund value.                                                          

Transfer Charge                                                                 

Currently, We do not charge You for making transfers of accumulation value among
investment divisions. We reserve the right to assess a $15 charge for each      
transfer after the 12th transfer in a contract year.                            

If We charge You for making a transfer, then We will allocate the charge        
proportionally to the investment divisions and Fixed Account from which the     
transfer is being made. All transfers included in one transfer request count as 
only one transfer for purposes of any fee. For example, if the transfer is made 
from two investment divisions and a charge applies, then a $7.50 transfer charge
will be deducted from each of the two investment divisions.                     

Loan Charge                                                                     

Loan interest is charged in arrears on the outstanding loan. Loan interest that 
is unpaid when due will be added to the outstanding loan at the end of each     
contract quarter (or, if earlier, on the date of loan repayment, surrender,     
contract termination or the annuitant's death) and will bear interest at the    
same rate of the loan. We charge interest on loans at the rate of 4.0% per year.

After offsetting the 1.5% annual interest rate We guarantee We will credit to   
the portion of Our Fixed Account securing the loan, the maximum guaranteed net  
cost of a loan is 2.5% per year.                                                

Charges In The Funds                                                            

The funds charge their portfolios for managing investments and providing        
services. The portfolios may also pay operating expenses. Each portfolio's      
charges and expenses vary. See the funds ' prospectuses for more information.   

Premium Taxes                                                                   

Midland will deduct from Your accumulation value at surrender, death or         
annuitization a charge for any premium taxes levied by a state or any other     
government entity. Premium taxes currently levied by certain jurisdictions vary 
from 0% to 3.5%. This range is subject to change. The Company currently deducts 
such charges from contracts issued in the states of South Dakota, Wyoming,      
Maine, and West Virginia. These states and jurisdictions are subject to change. 

Other Taxes                                                                     

At the present time, We do not make any charges to the Separate Account for any 
federal, state, or local taxes (other than premium taxes) that We incur which   
may be attributable to such account or to the contracts. We reserve the right to
make a charge for any such tax or economic burden resulting from the application
of the tax laws.                                                                

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

Introduction                                                                    

NOTE: We have prepared the following information on federal income taxes as a   
general discussion of the subject. It is not intended as tax advice to any      
individual. You should consult Your own tax advisor about Your own              
circumstances. We have included an additional discussion regarding taxes in the 
SAI.                                                                            

Annuity Contracts in General                                                    

Deferred annuities are a way of setting aside money for future needs like       
retirement. Congress recognized how important saving for retirement is and      
provided special rules in the Internal Revenue Code for annuities.              

Simply stated, these rules provide that generally You will not be taxed on the  
gain, if any, on the money held in Your annuity contract until You take the     
money out. This is referred to as tax deferral. There are different rules as to 
how You will be taxed depending on how You take the money out and the type of   
contract - qualified or non-qualified (discussed below).                        

You will generally not be taxed on increases in the value of Your contract until
a distribution occurs - either as a surrender or as annuity payments.           

When a non-natural person (e.g., corporation or certain other entities other    
than tax-qualified trusts) owns a non-qualified contract, the contract will     
generally not be treated as an annuity for tax purposes. There are some         
exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person    
should discuss these with a tax advisor.                                        

Qualified and Non-Qualified Contracts                                           
If You invest in a variable annuity as part of an individual retirement plan,   
pension plan or employer-sponsored retirement program, Your contract is called a
Qualified Contract. If Your annuity is independent of any formal retirement or  
pension plan, it is termed a Non-Qualified Contract. The tax rules applicable to
qualified contracts vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms 
and conditions of the plan.                                                     

Qualified contracts are issued in connection with the plans listed below. There 
is additional information about qualified contracts in the Statement of         
Additional Information.                                                         

o    Individual Retirement Annuity (IRA): A traditional IRA allows    
      individuals to make contributions, which may be deductible, to the
contract.                                                   

o    A Roth IRA also allows individuals to make contributions to the  
      contract, but it does not allow a deduction for contributions, and
   distributions may be tax-free if the owner meets certain rules.

   o    Corporate Pension and Profit-Sharing and H.R. 10 Plan: Employers and
     self-employed individuals can establish pension or profit-sharing
         plans for their employees or themselves and make contributions to the
contract on a pre-tax basis.                                

o    Deferred Compensation Plan (457 Plan): Certain governmental and  
         tax-exempt organization can establish a plan to defer compensation on
    behalf of their employees through contributions to the contract.

    o    Under Code section 403(b), payments made by public school systems and
      certain tax exempt organizations to purchase annuity contracts for
         their employees are excludable from the gross income of the employee,
          subject to certain limitations. However, these payments may be subject
     to FICA (Social Security) taxes. A qualified contract issued as a
 tax-sheltered annuity under section 403(b) will be amended as
      necessary to conform to the requirements of the Code. Code section
   403(b)(11) restricts the distribution under Code section 403(b)
annuity contracts of:                                       

          3.   elective contributions made in years beginning after December 31,
1988;                                             

4.   earning on those contributions; and                    

   5.   earnings in such years on amounts held as of the last year
beginning before January 1, 1989.                 

  Distribution of those amounts may only occur upon death of the
  employee, attainment of age 59 1/2, disability, severance from
         employment, or hardship. In addition, income attributable to elective
 contributions may not be distributed in the case of hardship.

o    Under Code section 401(a), corporate employers and self-employed 
individuals can establish various types of retire plans.    

    o    Under Code section 457, governmental and tax-exempt organizations can
establish deferred compensation plans.                      

The contract contains death benefit features that in some cases may exceed the  
greater of the net premium payments or the accumulation value. These death      
benefit features could be characterized as an incidental benefit, the amount of 
which is limited in any pension, profit-sharing plan, or 403(b) plan. Because   
the death benefit may exceed this limitation, employers using the contract in   
connection with such plans should consult their tax advisor. The Internal       
Revenue Service has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an IRA, and  
has not addressed in a ruling of general applicability whether a death benefit  
provision such as the provisions in the contract comports with IRA qualification
requirements.                                                                   

Qualified contracts have minimum distribution rules that govern the timing and  
amount of distributions. Distributions before age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10%
penalty tax. Also, distributions from qualified contracts are generally subject 
to withholding.                                                                 

"Eligible rollover distributions" from corporate pension, profit-sharing and    
H.R. 10 plans, 403(b) plans, and governmental 457 plans are subject to a        
mandatory federal income tax withholding of 20%. An eligible rollover           
distribution is any distribution to an employee (or employee's spouse or former 
spouse as beneficiary or alternate payee) from such a plan, except certain      
distributions such as distributions required by the Code, distributions in a    
specified annuity form, or hardship distributions. The 20% withholding does not 
apply, however, to nontaxable distributions or if the employee chooses a "direct
rollover" from the plan to a tax-qualified plan, IRA, or tax sheltered annuity  
or to a governmental 457 plan that agrees to separately account for rollover    
contributions.                                                                  

Loans                                                                           
Loans are available only if the contract if used in a Section 403(b) qualified  
plan. If the amount or duration of the loan violates Internal Revenue Code      
requirements, then You may be subject to income tax or a penalty. IRS           
authorities and the Department of Labor suggest that in certain circumstances a 
loan may result in adverse tax and ERISA consequences for Section 403(b)        
programs. A loan issued in connection with a 403(b) plan is generally subject to
a limit of the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the participant's vested ownership in
the 403(b) plan. The maximum loan amount may be lower if You currently have or  
have had a plan loan in the last 12 months. In addition, the Department of Labor
has issued regulations governing plan participant loans under the retirement    
plans subject to ERISA and the Department of Labor's regulations contain        
requirements for plan loans relating to their availability, amount and other    
matters. These requirements require, in part, that a loan from an ERISA-governed
plan be made under a enforceable agreement, bear a reasonable rate of interest  
be adequately secured, provide a reasonable payment schedule, and be made       
available on a basis that does not discriminate in favor of employees who are   
officers or shareholders or who are highly compensated. Failure to comply with  
these requirements may result in penalties under the Code and ERISA. You are    
responsible for determining whether Your plan is subject to, and complies with, 
ERISA and the Department of Labor's regulations governing plan loans. You should
consult a tax advisor before taking a loan.                                     

Diversification and Distribution Requirements                                   
The Internal Revenue Code provides that the underlying investments for a        
non-qualified variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements
in order to be treated as an annuity. The annuity must also meet certain        
distribution requirements at the death of an owner in order to be treated as an 
annuity contract. These diversification and distribution requirements are       
discussed in the SAI. Midland may modify the contract to attempt to maintain    
favorable tax treatment.                                                        

Surrenders - Non-Qualified Contracts                                            
If You purchase the contract as an individual and not under an individual       
retirement annuity, or other qualified retirement plan, Your contract is        
referred to as a non-qualified contract.                                        

If You make a surrender from a non-qualified contract before the annuity        
commencement date, the Internal Revenue Code treats that surrender as first     
coming from gain and then from Your premium payments. When You make a surrender 
You are taxed on the amount of the surrender that is gain. If You make a full   
surrender, You are generally taxed on the amount that Your surrender proceeds   
exceed the "investment in the contract," which is generally Your premiums paid  
(adjusted for any prior partial surrenders that came out of the premiums).      
Different rules apply for annuity payments. See "Annuity Payments" below.       

The Internal Revenue Code also provides that surrendered gain may be subject to 
a penalty. The amount of the penalty is equal to 10% of the amount that is      
includable in income. Some surrenders will be exempt from the penalty. This     
includes any amount:                                                            

o    paid on or after the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2;                

o    paid after an owner dies;                                        

     o    paid if the taxpayer becomes totally disabled (as that term is defined
in the Internal Revenue Code);                              

 o    paid in a series of substantially equal payments made annually (or
more frequently) under a lifetime annuity;                  

o    paid under an immediate maturity; or                             

o    which come from premium payments made prior to August 14, 1982.  

Multiple Contracts                                                              
All non-qualified deferred contracts that are issued by Midland (or its         
affiliates) to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one       
annuity for purposes of determining the amount includable in the owner's income 
when a taxable distribution occurs.                                             

Withholding                                                                     
Distributions from qualified and non-qualified contracts, generally are subject 
to withholding for Your federal income tax liability. The withholding rate      
varies according to the type of distribution and Your tax status. You will be   
provided the opportunity to elect not to have tax withheld from distributions.  

Annuity Payments                                                                
Although the tax consequences may vary depending on the annuity payment option  
You select, in general, for non-qualified and certain qualified contracts, only 
a portion of the annuity payments You receive will be includable in Your gross  
income.                                                                         

In general, the excludable portion of each annuity payment You receive will be  
determined as follows:                                                          

   o    Fixed payments - by dividing the "investment in the contract" on the
         maturity date by the total expected value of the annuity payments for
    the term of the payments. This is the percentage of each annuity
payment that is excludable.                                 

  o    Variable payments - by dividing the "investment in the contract" on
        the maturity date by the total number of expected periodic payments.
  This is the amount of each annuity payment that is excludable.

The remainder of each annuity payment is includable in gross income. Once the   
"investment in the contract" has been fully recovered, the full amount of any   
additional annuity payments is includable in gross income.                      

If You select more than one annuity payment option, special rules govern the    
allocation of the contract's entire "investment in the contract" to each such   
option, for purposes of determining the excludable amount of each payment       
received under that option. We advise You to consult a competent tax advisor as 
to the potential tax effects of allocation amounts to any particular annuity    
payment option.                                                                 

If, after the annuity commencement date, annuity payments stop because an       
annuitant has died, the excess (if any) of the "investment in the contract" as  
of the annuity maturity date over the aggregate amount of annuity payments      
received that was excluded from gross income is generally allowable as a        
deduction for Your last taxable year.                                           

Annuity Contracts Purchased by Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations      
The discussion above provided general information regarding U.S. federal income 
tax consequences to annuity owners that are U.S. persons. Taxable distributions 
made to owners who are not U.S. persons will generally be subject to U.S.       
federal income tax withholding at a 30% rate, unless a lower treaty rate        
applies. In addition, distributions may be subject to state and/or municipal    
taxes and taxes that may be imposed by the owner's country of citizenship or    
residence. Prospective foreign owners are advised to consult with a qualified   
tax advisor regarding U.S., state, and foreign taxation for any annuity contract
purchase.                                                                       

Taxation of Death Benefit Proceeds                                              
Amounts may be distributed from the contract because of the death of an owner or
an annuitant. Generally, such amounts should be includable in the income of the 
recipient:                                                                      

o    if distributed in a lump sum, these amounts are taxed in the same
manner as a full surrender; or                              

o    if distributed under an annuity payment option, these amounts are
taxed in the same manner as annuity payments.               

Transfers, Assignments or Exchange of Contracts                                 
A transfer of ownership or absolute assignment of a contract, the designation of
an annuitant or payee or other beneficiary who is not also the owner, the       
selection of certain maturity dates, or a change of annuitant, may result in    
certain income or gift tax consequences to the owner that are beyond the scope  
of this discussion. An owner contemplating any such transfer, assignment,       
selection, or change should contact a competent tax advisor with respect to the 
potential tax effect s of such a transaction.                                   

Possible Tax Law Changes                                                        
Although the likelihood of legislative changes is uncertain, there is always the
possibility that the tax treatment of the contract could change by legislation  
or otherwise. You should consult a tax advisor with respect to legal            
developments and their effect on the contract.                                  

Separate Account Charges                                                        
It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may take a position that fees  
for certain optional benefits are deemed to be taxable distributions to You.    
Although We do not believe that the fees associated with any optional benefit   
provided under the contract should be treated as taxable surrenders, You should 
consult Your tax advisor prior to selecting any optional benefit under the      
contract.                                                                       

MATURITY DATE 

The maturity date is the date on which income payments will begin under the     
annuity option You have selected. The earliest possible maturity date under the 
contract is the 4th contract anniversary at which time You may annuitize Your   
surrender value (less any premium taxes). However, by current Company practice, 
We will allow You to annuitize after the first contract year. If You choose any 
life income or joint and survivor income payout options after the first contract
year, We will allow You to annuitize the full accumulation value (plus any      
applicable interest adjustment and less any premium taxes). This is not         
guaranteed. If You choose any other payout option after the first contract year,
You will annuitize Your contract for the surrender value. An interest adjustment
will apply to any value allocated to one or more MYG Options of the Fixed       
Account. The maximum maturity date is the contract anniversary immediately      
following the annuitant's 100th birthday. You may change the maturity date by   
sending written notice to Our Principal Office. We must receive Your at least 30
days prior to the original maturity date.                                       

If You have not previously specified otherwise and have not elected certain     
systematic withdrawal options, then on the maturity date You may:               

1.   take the accumulation value in one lump sum, or                  

2.   convert the accumulation value into an annuity payable to the    
annuitant under one of the payment options described below. 

Selecting An Annuity Option                                                     
You may apply the proceeds of a surrender to effect an annuity. Unless You      
choose otherwise, Your surrender value from the Fixed Account will be applied to
a 10 year certain and life fixed payout and the surrender value from the        
Separate Account will be applied to a 10 year certain and life variable payout. 
The first monthly annuity payment will be made within one month after the       
maturity date. Variable payment options are not available in certain states.    

Currently, the payment options are only available if the proceeds applied are   
$2,500 or more and the first periodic payment will be at least $50. We reserve  
the right to change the payment frequency so that payments are at least $50.    

The payee's actual age will affect each payment amount for annuity income       
options involving life income. The amount of each annuity payment to older      
payees will be greater than for younger payees because payments to older payees 
are expected to be fewer in number. For annuity income options that do not      
involve life income, the length of the payment period will affect the amount of 
each payment. With a shorter period, the amount of each annuity payment will be 
greater. Payments that occur more frequently will be smaller than those         
occurring less frequently.                                                      

The payee or any other person who is entitled to receive payments may name a    
beneficiary to receive any amount that We would otherwise pay to that person's  
estate if that person died. The person who is entitled to receive payment may   
change the beneficiary at any time.                                             

Payment options will be subject to Our rules at the time of selection. We must  
approve any arrangements that involve more than one of the payment options, or a
payee who is not a natural person (for example, a corporation), or a payee who  
is a fiduciary or an assignee. Also, the details of all arrangements will be    
subject to Our rules at the time the arrangements take effect. This includes:   

o    rules on the minimum amount We will pay under an option;         

 o    minimum amounts for installment payments, surrender or commutation
       rights (Your rights to receive payments over time, for which We may
offer You a lump sum payment);                              

 o    the naming of people who are entitled to receive payment and their
beneficiaries; and                                          

o    the ways of proving age, gender, and survival.                   

You choose a payment option when You apply for a contract and may change it by  
writing to Our Principal Office. You must elect the payment plan at least 30    
days before the maturity date.                                                  

Fixed Options                                                                   
Payments under the fixed options are not affected by the investment experience  
of any investment division. The surrender value as of the maturity date will be 
applied to the fixed option selected. We guarantee interest under the fixed     
options at a rate of 1.5% a year. We may also credit interest under the fixed   
deposit options at a rate that is above the 1.5% guaranteed rate (this is at Our
complete discretion). Thereafter, interest or payments are fixed according to   
the options chosen.                                                             

Variable Options                                                                
Payments under the variable options will vary in amount depending on the        
investment experience of the investment divisions after the maturity date.      
Variable payment options are not available in certain states.                   

The annuity tables contained in the contract are based on a 5% (five percent)   
assumed investment rate. This is a fulcrum rate around which variable annuity   
payments will fluctuate to reflect whether the investment experience of the     
investment divisions is better or worse than the assumed investment rate. If the
actual investment experience exceeds the assumed investment rate, then the      
payment will increase. Conversely, if the actual investment experience is less  
than the assumed rate, then payments will decrease.                             

We determine the amount of the first monthly variable payment by applying the   
surrender value in each investment division (as of a date not more than 10      
business days prior to the maturity date) to the appropriate rate (from the     
annuity tables in the contract) for the payout options selected using the       
payee's age and sex (where permissible). The amount of the first payment will   
then be used to determine the number of annuity units for each investment       
division. The number of annuity units is used to determine the amount of        
subsequent variable payments.                                                   

The annuity Unit value for each investment division will be initially set at    
$10. Thereafter the annuity Unit value will vary with the investment experience 
of the investment division and will reflect the mortality and expense risk      
charge We make at an effective annual rate of 1.55% . The annuity Unit value    
will increase if the net investment experience (investment experience minus the 
asset charge) is greater than the 5% assumed investment rate. The annuity Unit  
value will decrease if the net investment experience is less than the 5% assumed
investment rate.                                                                

The amount of each subsequent variable payment will be determined for each      
investment division by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity   
Unit value.                                                                     

Additional information on the variable annuity payments is contained in the SAI 
that can be obtained for free by contacting Us at Our Principal Office.         

Payout Options                                                                  
The following four payout options are available:                                

1.   Income for Specified Period: We pay installments for a specified 
     period. We will pay the amount applied in equal installments plus
        applicable interest (excess interest may be paid at Our discretion),
    for a specified time, from 5 up to 20 years. (Fixed Option Only)

  2.   Life Annuity: We will pay the money as monthly income for life. You
may choose from 1 of 2 ways to receive the income:          

    (a)  Life Annuity: We will pay equal monthly payments during the
        lifetime of the payee. With a life annuity payment option,
       payments will only be made as long as the payee is alive.
             Therefore, if the payee dies after the first payment, then only
one payment will be made.                         

      (b)  With Certain Period: We will pay equal monthly payments for a
             selected number of guaranteed payments, and then for as long as
the payee is living thereafter.                   

    3.   Income for a Specified Amount: We will pay income of the accumulation
       value until the principal and interest are exhausted. Payments will
        begin on the maturity date and will continue until the principal and
      interest, at the rate of 1.5% compounded per annum, are exhausted.
     Payments must continue for more than 5 years. (Fixed Option Only)

 4.   Joint and Survivor Income: We will make monthly payments until the
         last surviving payee's death. Therefore, if both payees die after the
         first payment, then only one payment will be made. The annuitant must
          be at least 50 years old and the beneficiary/payee must be at least 45
years old, at the time of the first monthly payment.        

Annuitization Bonus                                                             
If You decide to annuitize Your contract any time after the 4th contract year,  
We guarantee that We will credit Your accumulation value with an additional     
percentage of the accumulation value based on the pay-out option You choose as  
follows:                                                                        

o    A 2.0% annuitization bonus will be credited on any payout option 
         available under this contract that guarantees payment for ten or more
years.                                                      

o    A 1.0% annuitization bonus will be credited on all other payout  
options available under this contract.                      

There is no additional charge for this benefit.                                 

Transfers after the Maturity Date                                               
After the maturity date, only two transfers per contract year may be made among 
the investment divisions. Completed transfer requests received at Our Principal 
Office before the New York Stock Exchange closes for regular trading (usually   
3:00 p.m. Central Time) are priced at the unit value determined at the close of 
that regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange. If We receive Your 
completed transfer request after the close of regular trading on the New York   
Stock Exchange, We will process the transfer request at the unit value          
determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the New York     
Stock Exchange. The transfer request must be received at least 10 business days 
before the due date of the first annuity payment to which the change will apply.
Transfers after the annuity payments have started will be based on the annuity  
Unit values. There will be no transfer charge for this transfer. No transfers   
are allowed to or from the Fixed Account.

We are Midland National Life Insurance Company, a stock life insurance company. 
We were organized in 1906, in South Dakota, as a mutual life insurance company  
at that time named "The Dakota Mutual Life Insurance Company." We were          
reincorporated as a stock life insurance company, in 1909. Our name "Midland"   
was adopted in 1925. We were redomesticated to Iowa in 1999. We are licensed to 
do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin     
Islands, Guam and the Mariana Islands. Our Principal Office address is:

Midland National is a subsidiary of Sammons Enterprises, Inc., Dallas, Texas.   
Sammons Enterprises has controlling or substantial stock interests in a large   
number of other companies engaged in the areas of insurance, corporate services,
and industrial distribution.                                                    

Fund Voting Rights                                                              

We invest the assets of Our Separate Account investment divisions in shares of  
the funds' portfolios. Midland is the legal owner of the shares and has the     
right to vote on certain matters. Among other things, We may vote:              

o    to elect the funds' Board of Directors,                          

o    to ratify the selection of independent auditors for the funds,   

   o    on any other matters described in the funds' current prospectuses or
        requiring a vote by shareholders under the Investment Company Act of
1940, and                                                   

o    in some cases, to change the investment objectives and contracts.

Even though We own the shares, We may give You the opportunity to tell Us how to
vote the number of shares that are allocated to Your contract.                  

The funds will determine if and how often shareholder meetings are held. As We  
receive notice of these meetings, We will ask for Your voting instructions. The 
funds are not required to hold a meeting in any given year.                     

If We do not receive instructions in time from all contract owners, then We     
currently intend to vote those shares in the same proportion as We vote shares  
for which We have received instructions in that portfolio. We currently intend  
to vote any Fund shares that We alone are entitled to vote in the same          
proportions that contract owners vote. If the federal securities laws or        
regulations or interpretations of them change so that We are permitted to vote  
shares of the Fund in Our own right or to restrict owner voting, then We may do 
so.                                                                             

How We Determine Your Voting Shares                                             
You may participate in voting only on matters concerning the Fund portfolios in 
which Your accumulation value has been invested. We determine Your voting shares
in each division by dividing the amount of Your accumulation value allocated to 
that division by the net asset value of one share of the corresponding Fund     
portfolio. This is determined as of the record date set by the Fund's Board for 
the shareholders meeting.                                                       

If You have a voting interest, then We will send You proxy material and a form  
for giving Us voting instructions. In certain cases, We may disregard           
instructions relating to changes in the Fund's adviser or the investment        
contracts of its portfolios.                                                    

Voting Privileges of Participants In Other Companies                            
Other insurance companies own shares in the Funds to support their variable life
insurance and variable annuity products. We do not foresee any disadvantage to  
this. Nevertheless, each Fund's Board of Directors will monitor events to       
identify conflicts that may arise and determine appropriate action. If We       
disagree with any Fund action, then We will see that appropriate action is taken
to protect Our contract owners. If We ever believe that any of the Funds '      
portfolios are so large as to materially impair its investment performance, then
We will examine other investment options.                                       

Our Reports to Owners                                                           

Shortly after the end of each calendar year, We will send a report that shows   

o    Your accumulation value, and                                     

o    Any transactions involving Your accumulation value that occurred 
   during the year. Transactions include Your premium allocations,
transfers and partial surrenders made in that year.         

The annual statements are sent instead of sending a confirmation of certain     
transactions (such as premium payments by automatic bank draft checking account 
deductions or Civil Service Allotment).                                         

Confirmation notices will be sent to You for premiums, transfers of amounts     
between investment divisions and certain other contract transactions.           

We also currently intend to send You semi-annual reports with financial         
information on the funds.                                                       

Contract Periods, Anniversaries                                                 

We measure contract years, contract months and contract anniversaries from the  
issue dateshown on Your contract's information page. Each contract month begins 
on the same day in each month. The calendar days of 29, 30, and 31 are not used 
for the purpose of contract anniversaries. If Your initial premium is received  
on one of these dates, Your contract anniversary day will be the first day of   
the next month.                                                                 

Dividends                                                                       

We do not pay any dividends on the contract described in this prospectus.       

Performance                                                                     

Performance information for the investment divisions may appear in reports and  
advertising to current and prospective owners. The performance information is   
based on the historical investment experience of the investment division and the
portfolios and does not indicate or represent future performance.               

Total returns are based on the overall dollar or percentage change in value of a
hypothetical investment. Total return quotations reflect changes in portfolio   
share price, the automatic reinvestment by the Separate Account of all          
distributions and the deduction of applicable charges (including any surrender  
charges that would apply if You surrendered the contract at the end of the      
period indicated). Quotations of total return may also be shown that do not take
into account certain contract charges such as the surrender charge. The total   
return percentage will be higher under this method than under the standard      
method described above.                                                         

A cumulative total return reflects performance over a stated period of time. If 
the performance had been constant over the entire period, then an average annual
total return reflects the hypothetical annually compounded return that would    
have produced the same cumulative total return. Because average annual total    
returns tend to smooth out variations in an investment division's returns, You  
should recognize that they are not the same as actual year-by-year results.     

Some investment divisions may also advertise yield. These measures reflect the  
income generated by an investment in the investment divisions over a specified  
period of time. This income is annualized and shown as a percentage. Yields do  
to not take into account capital gains or losses or the surrender charge. The   
standard quotations of yield reflect the annual maintenance fee.                

The money market investment divisions may advertise its current and effective   
yield. Current yield reflects the income generated by an investment in the      
investment division over a 7 day period. Effective yield is calculated in       
similar manner except that income earned is assumed to be reinvested. Other     
investment divisions may advertise a 30 day yield which reflects the income     
generated by an investment in the investment division over a 30 day period.     

We may also advertise performance figures for the investment divisions based on 
the performance of a portfolio prior to the time the Separate Account commenced 
operations.                                                                     

Change of Address Notification                                                  

To protect You from fraud and theft, We may verify any changes in address You   
request by sending a confirmation of the change of address to both Your old and 
new addresses. We may also call You to verify the change of address.            

Modification To Your Contract                                                   

Upon notice to You, We may modify Your contract to:                             

(a)  permit the contract of the Separate Account to comply with any   
applicable law or regulation issues by a government agency; 

   (b)  assure continued qualification of the contract under the Tax Code or
   other federal or state laws relating to retirement annuities or
variable annuity contracts;                                 

(c)  reflect a change in the operation of the Separate Account; or    

(d)  provide additional investment options.                           

In the event of such modifications, We will make an appropriate endorsement to  
the contract.                                                                   

Your Beneficiary                                                                

You name Your beneficiary in Your contract application. The beneficiary is      
entitled to the death benefit of the contract. A beneficiary is revocable unless
otherwise stated in the beneficiary designation. You may change the revocable   
beneficiary during the owner's and annuitant's lifetime. We must receive written
notice informing Us of the change. Upon receipt and acceptance at Our Principal 
Office, a change takes effect as of the date that the written notice was signed.
We will not be liable for any payment made before We receive and accept the     
written notice. If no primary beneficiary is living when the owner or annuitant 
dies, the death benefit will be paid to the contingent beneficiary, if any. If  
no beneficiary is living when the owner or annuitant dies, then We will pay the 
death benefit to the owner's or annuitant's estate.                             

If there are joint owners, the surviving joint owner, if any, will be considered
the designated primary beneficiary, unless the joint owners have otherwise      
designated a primary beneficiary either on the application or by sending Us a   
written notice. If a person other than a joint owner is named a primary         
beneficiary, the surviving owner will not be entitled to proceeds upon the death
of the first owner.                                                             

Assigning Your Contract                                                         

You may assign Your rights in a non-qualified contract. You must send a copy of 
the assignment to Our Principal Office. The assignment takes effect as of the   
date that the written notice was signed. We are not responsible for the validity
of the assignment or for any payment We make or any action We take before We    
record notice of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of          
ownership. There may be tax consequences.                                       

When We Pay Proceeds From This Contract                                         

We will generally pay any death benefits or surrenders within seven days after  
receiving the required form(s) at Our Principal Office. Death benefits are      
determined as of the date We receive due proof of death, an election of a       
settlement option, and any other required forms or documentation. If We do not  
receive a written election and all other required forms within 90 days after    
receipt of due proof of death, then a lump sum payment will be paid as of that  
date.                                                                           

We may delay payment for one or more of the following reasons:                  

1)   We cannot determine the amount of the payment because:           

a)   the New York Stock Exchange is closed,                 

 b)   trading in securities has been restricted by the SEC, or

c)   the SEC has declared that an emergency exists,         

     2)   The SEC by order permits Us to delay payment to protect Our owners, or

3)   Your premium check(s) have not cleared Your bank.                

Federal laws designed to counter terrorism and prevent money laundering by      
criminals might in certain circumstances require Us to reject a premium payment 
and/or "freeze" a contract owner's account. If these laws apply in a particular 
situation, We would not be allowed to process any request for withdrawals,      
surrenders, loans, or death benefits, make transfers, or continue making annuity
payments. If a contract or account is frozen, the accumulation value would be   
moved to a special segregated interest bearing account and held in that account 
until We receive instructions from the appropriate federal regulator. We may    
also be required to provide information about You and Your contract to the      
government agencies and departments.                                            

We may defer payment of any surrender from the Fixed Account, for up to six     
months after We receive Your request.                                           

Distribution of the Contracts                                                   

We have entered into a distribution agreement with Our affiliate, Sammons       
Securities Company, LLC ("Sammons Securities Company") for the distribution and 
sale of the contracts. Sammons Securities Company is an indirect wholly owned   
subsidiary of Sammons Enterprises, Inc., of Dallas, Texas, the ultimate parent  
company of Midland National Life Insurance Company. Sammons Securities Company  
offers the contracts through its registered representatives. Sammons Securities 
Company may enter into written sales agreements with other broker-dealers       
("selling firms") for the sale of the contracts. We pay commissions to Sammons  
Securities Company for sales of the Contracts by its registered representatives 
as well as by selling firms. All of the portfolio companies make payments to    
Midland National under their distribution plans in consideration of services    
provided and expenses incurred by Midland National in distributing portfolio    
shares. These payments range from 0.15% to 0.50% of Separate Account assets     
invested in the particular fund.                                                

Sales commissions may vary, but the maximum commission payable for contract     
sales is 5.50% of premiums payments. Where lower commissions are paid, We may   
also pay trail commissions. We may also pay additional amounts and reimburse    
additional expenses of Sammons Securities Company based on various factors.     

We also pay for Sammons Securities Company's operating and other expenses,      
including the following sales expenses: sales representative training           
allowances; compensation and bonuses for the Sammons Securities Company's       
management team; advertising expenses; and all other expenses of distributing   
the contracts. Sammons Securities Company pays its registered representatives   
all or a portion of the commissions received for their sales of contracts.      
Registered representatives and their managers are also eligible for various cash
benefits, such as bonuses, insurance benefits and financing arrangements, and   
non-cash compensation items that We may provide jointly with Sammons Securities 
Company.                                                                        

Non-cash items that We and Sammons Securities Company may provide include       
conferences, seminars and trips (including travel, lodging and meals in         
connection therewith), entertainment, merchandise and other similar items. In   
addition, Sammons Securities Company's registered representatives who meet      
certain productivity, persistency and length of service standards and/or their  
managers may be eligible for additional compensation. Sales of the contracts may
help registered representatives and/or their managers qualify for such benefits.
Sammons Securities Company's registered representatives and managers may receive
other payments from Us for services that do not directly involve the sale of the
contracts, including payments made for the recruitment and training of          
personnel, production of promotional literature and similar services.           

A portion of the payments made to selling firms may be passed on to their       
registered representatives in accordance with their internal compensation       
programs. Those programs may also include other types of cash and non-cash      
compensation and other benefits. Ask Your registered representative for further 
information about what Your registered representative and the selling firm for  
which he or she works may receive in connection with Your purchase of a         
contract.                                                                       

We intend to recoup commissions and other sales expenses indirectly through the 
following fees and charges deducted under the contract: (a) the surrender       
charge; (b) the mortality and expense charge; (c) revenues, if any, received    
from the underlying portfolios or their managers; and (d) investment earnings on
amount allocated under the contract to the Fixed Account. Commissions and other 
incentives or payments described above are not charged directly to You or the   
Separate Account.                                                               

Regulation                                                                      

We are regulated and supervised by the Iowa Insurance Department. We are subject
to the insurance laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where We sell       
contracts. The provisions of this contract may vary somewhat from jurisdiction  
to jurisdiction.                                                                

We submit annual reports on Our operations and finances to insurance officials  
in all the jurisdictions where We sell contracts. The officials are responsible 
for reviewing Our reports to be sure that We are financially sound and are      
complying with the applicable laws and regulations. We are also subject to      
various federal securities laws and regulations.                                

Discount for Employees of Sammons Enterprises, Inc.                             

Employees of Sammons Enterprises, Inc., and its subsidiaries, may receive waiver
of charges, reduced charges, or a premium contribution to the contract of 100%  
of the first year commission that would normally have been paid on the          
employee's first year premiums. Midland National is a subsidiary of Sammons     
Enterprises, Inc., and additional premium payments contributed solely by Us will
be paid into the employee's contract during the first year.                     

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
Midland National Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, like other life   
insurance companies, may be involved in lawsuits, including class action        
lawsuits. In some class action and other lawsuits involving insurers,           
substantial damages have been sought and/or material settlement payments have   
been made. Although the outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with      
certainty, Midland National Life Insurance Company believes that, as of the date
of this prospectus, there are not pending or threatened lawsuits that will have 
a materially adverse impact on them, the Separate Account, or the Separate      
Account's principal underwriter, Sammons Securities Company, LLC.               

Legal Matters                                                                   

The law firm of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP, Washington, DC, has provided   
certain legal advice relating to certain matters under the federal securities   
laws. We are not involved in any material legal proceedings.

THE CONTRACT

Entire Contract                                                                 
The entire contract between You and Us consists of the contract, the attached   
written application and any attached endorsements, riders, and amendments.      

Changes to the Contract                                                         
No one has the right to change any part of the contract or to waive any of its  
provisions unless the change is approved in writing by one of Our officers. Only
our President or Secretary may modify the contract.                             

We may change the contract without Your consent to conform to state or federal  
laws or regulations. A change will be made by attaching an endorsement to the   
contract.                                                                       

Change of Beneficiary                                                           

You may change a revocable beneficiary. We must receive written notice informing
Us of the change. Upon receipt and acceptance, a change takes effect as of the  
date the written notice was signed. We will not be liable for any payment made  
before We record the written notice.                                            

Incontestability                                                                

We will not contest the contract.                                               

Misstatement of Age or Sex                                                      
If the age or sex of the annuitant has been misstated, We will adjust the amount
of each annuity payment to whatever the applied value would have purchased at   
the correct age and sex. Any underpayments made by Us will be paid to the payee.
Any overpayments made by Us will be charged against benefits falling due after  
adjustment. All underpayments and overpayments will include interest at the rate
required by the jurisdiction in which the contract is delivered.                

Non-Participating                                                               
The contract does not participate in the surplus or profits of the Company and  
the Company does not pay any dividends on it.                                   

Claims of Creditors                                                             
To the extent permitted by law, no benefits payable under the contract to a     
beneficiary or payee are subject to the claims of creditors.                    

Minimum Benefits                                                                
The annuity payments, surrender values and death benefit under the contract are 
not less than the minimum required by the laws of the state in which the        
contract is delivered.                                                          

Ownership                                                                       
The contract belongs to You. You have all rights granted by the contract,       
including the right to change owners and beneficiaries, subject to the rights   
of:                                                                             

1)   Any assignee of record with Us;                                  

2)   Any irrevocable beneficiary; and                                 

3)   Any restricted ownership.                                        

We must receive written notice informing Us of any change, designation or       
revocation. Once recorded, a change, designation or revocation takes effect as  
of the date the written notice was signed. However, We are not liable for       
payments made by Us before We record the written notice. A change of owner may  
have adverse tax consequences.                                                  

Assignment                                                                      
An assignment may have adverse tax consequences.                                
You may assign the contract by giving Us written notice. We will not be         
responsible for the validity of any assignment. We will not be liable for any   
payments We make prior to recording the written notice of assignment.           

Accumulation Unit Value                                                         
We determine accumulation unit values for each investment division of Our       
Separate Account at the end of each business day. The accumulation unit value   
for each investment division was initially set at $10.00. The accumulation unit 
value for any business day is equal to the accumulation unit value for the      
preceding business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that division
on that business day.                                                           

We determine the net investment factor for each investment division every       
business day as follows:                                                        

  o    First, We take the net asset value per share held in the investment
      division at the end of the current business day plus the per share
        amount of any dividends or capital gain distributions on shares held
          in the investment divisions on the current business day; minus the per
       share amount of any capital loss, realized or unrealized, on shares
 held in the investment divisions on the current business day.

   o    Then, We divide this amount by the net asset value per share held in
     the investment division at the close of business on the preceding
          business day (after giving effect to any contract transactions on that
day).                                                       

   o    Then, We subtract a daily asset charge for each calendar day between
        business days (for example, a Monday calculation may include charges
    for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday). The daily charge is currently
       0.00425% which is an effective annual rate of 1.55%. This charge is
        for mortality and expense risks assumed by Us under the contract and
          to cover administrative costs We incur for transactions related to the
Separate Account.                                           

   o    Finally, We reserve the right to subtract any other daily charge for
taxes or amounts set aside as a reserve for taxes.          

Generally, this means that We would adjust unit values to reflect what happens  
to the funds, and also for any charges.                                         

Annuity Payments                                                                
The amount of each fixed annuity payment will be set on the Maturity Date and   
will not subsequently be affected by the investment performance of the          
investment divisions.                                                           

The amount of each variable annuity payment will be affected by the investment  
performance of the investment divisions. Variable payment options are not       
available in certain states.                                                    

The dollar amount of the first monthly variable annuity payment is computed for 
each investment division by applying the surrender value in the investment      
division, as of a date not more than 10 business days prior to the maturity     
date, to the appropriate rate for the payout option selected using the age and  
sex (where permissible) of the annuitant. The number of annuity units for each  
investment division is then calculated by dividing the first variable annuity   
payment for that investment division by the investment division's annuity unit  
value as of the same date.                                                      

The dollar amount of each subsequent payment from an investment division is     
equal to the number of annuity units for that investment division times the     
annuity unit value for that investment division as of a uniformly applied date  
not more than 10 business days before the annuity payment is due.               

The payment made to the annuitant for the first payment and all subsequent      
payments will be the sum of the payment amounts for each investment division.   

The annuity unit value for each investment division was initially set at $10.   
The Annuity Unit Value for any business day is equal to (1) multiplied by (2)   
multiplied by (3) where:                                                        

(1)  = the Annuity Unit Value for the preceding business day:         

    (2)  = the net investment factor (as described above) for that division on
that business day.                                      

    (3)  = the investment result adjustment factor 0.99986634% per day), which
  recognizes an assumed interest rate of 5% per year used in
determining the annuity payment amounts.                

Transfers after the maturity date will only be allowed twice per contract year  
and will be made using the annuity unit value for the investment divisions on   
the date the request for transfer is received. On the transfer date, the number 
of annuity units transferred from the investment division is multiplied by the  
annuity unit value for that investment division to determine the value being    
transferred. This value is then transferred into the indicated investment       
division(s) by converting this value into annuity units of the proper investment
division(s). The annuity units are determined by dividing the value being       
transferred into an investment division by the annuity unit value of the        
investment division on the transfer date. The transfer shall result in the same 
dollar amount of variable annuity payment on the date of transfer.              

 CALCULATION OF YIELDS AND TOTAL RETURNS

Money Market Investment Division Yield Calculation                              

In accordance with regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange           
Commission, Midland National is required to compute the Fidelity VIP Money      
Market investment division's (called "the money market investment division" for 
the purpose of this section) current annualized yield for a seven-day period in 
a manner which does not take into consideration any realized or unrealized gains
or losses on shares of the money market investment division or on its portfolio 
securities. This current annualized yield is computed for the money market      
investment division by determining the net change (exclusive of realized gains  
and losses on the sale of securities and unrealized appreciation and            
depreciation and income other than investment income) in the value of a         
hypothetical account having a balance of one unit of the money market investment
division at the beginning of such seven-day period, dividing such net change in 
account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to     
determine the base period return and annualizing this quotient on a 365-day     
basis. The net change in account value reflects the deductions for the annual   
maintenance fee, the mortality and expense risk charge, and income and expenses 
accrued during the period. Because of these deductions, the yield for the money 
market investment division of the Separate Account will be lower than the yield 
for the money market investment division or any comparable substitute funding   
vehicle.                                                                        

The Securities and Exchange Commission also permits Midland National to disclose
the effective yield of the money market investment division for the same        
seven-day period, determined on a compounded basis. The effective yield is      
calculated by compounding the unannualized base period return by adding one to  
the base period return, raising the sum to a power equal to 365 divided by 7,   
and subtracting one from the result.                                            

The yield on amounts held in the money market investment division normally will 
fluctuate on a daily basis. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past   
period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of      
return. The money market investment division's actual yield is affected by      
changes in interest rates on money market securities, average portfolio maturity
of the money market investment divisions or substitute funding vehicle, the     
types and quality of portfolio securities held by the money market investment   
division or substitute funding vehicle, and operating expenses. In addition, the
yield figures are for the base contract and do not reflect the effect of any    
surrender charge that may be applicable to a particular contract.               

Other Investment Division Yield Calculations                                    

Midland National may from time to time disclose the current annualized yield of 
one or more of the investment divisions (except the money market investment     
divisions) for 30-day periods. The annualized yield of an investment division   
refers to income generated by the investment division over a specified 30-day   
period. Because the yield is annualized, the yield generated by an investment   
division during the 30-day period is assumed to be generated each 30-day period.
This yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per accumulation   
unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day of the      
period, according to the following formula:                                     

YIELD = 2 [ (a - b + 1)6 - 1 ]                                          
-----                                         
cd                                          

Where: a =  net investment income earned during the period by the 
               portfolio (or substitute funding vehicle) attributable to
shares owned by the investment division.  
         b =  expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).
         c =  the average daily number of units outstanding during the
period.                                   
           d =  the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the
period.                                   

Net investment income will be determined in accordance with rules established by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accrued expenses will include all       
recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts. The yield calculations do
not reflect the effect of any surrender charges that may be applicable to a     
particular contract. Surrender charges range from 9% to 0% of the amount of     
premium withdrawn depending on the elapsed time since the premium was paid.     

Because of the charges and deductions imposed by the Separate Account the yield 
of the investment division will be lower than the yield for the corresponding   
portfolio. The yield on amounts held in the investment divisions normally will  
fluctuate over time. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past period is
not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return. The    
investment division's actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of 
portfolio securities held by the portfolio, and its operating expenses.         

Standard Total Return Calculations                                              

Midland National may from time to time also disclose average annual total       
returns for one or more of the investment divisions for various periods of time.
Average annual total return quotations are computed by finding the average      
annual compounded rates of return over one, five and ten year periods that would
equate the initial amount invested to the ending redeemable value, according to 
the following formula:                                                          
P (1 + T)n = ERV                                      
        Where:        P =     a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000
         T =     average annual total return
n =     number of years   
                       ERV =   ending redeemable value of a hypothetical
                                 $1,000 payment made at the beginning of the
                                  one, five, or ten-year period, at the end of
                           the one, five, or ten-year period (or
                  fractional portion thereof).

All recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts are recognized in the 
ending redeemable value. This includes a contract charges factor that is        
calculated by taking the daily Separate Account asset charge and adding an      
additional amount that adjusts for the current annual $30 annual maintenance    
fee. This additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation     
value of $35,000 so it is calculated as $30/$35,000, or 0.09% annually. The     
standard average annual total return calculations assume the contract is        
surrendered and therefore will reflect the effect of surrender charges that may 
be applicable to a particular period.                                           

Midland National may disclose average annual total returns in various ways,     
depicting whether the contract is surrendered or maintained inforce.            
Accordingly, Midland National may disclose the following types of average annual
total return:                                                                   

1.   The contract is surrendered.                                     

2.   The contract is not surrendered.                                 

Midland National may from time to time also disclose average annual total       
returns in a format, which assumes that the contract is kept in force through   
the time period shown. Such non-standard returns will be identical to the       
standard format, which assumes the contract is surrendered except that the      
contingent deferred sales charge percentage will be assumed to be 0%. The       
non-standard returns, which assume the contract is kept inforce, will only be   
shown in conjunction with standard returns, which assume the contract is        
surrendered.                                                                    

Cumulative Total Returns                                                        

Midland National may from time to time also disclose cumulative total returns in
conjunction with the annual returns described above. The cumulative returns will
be calculated using the following formula.                                      

CTR = [ERV/P] - 1                                                     
 Where:    CTR =  the cumulative total return net of investment division
recurring charges for the period.   
           ERV = ending redeemable value of an assumed $1,000 payment at
               the beginning of the one, five, or ten-year period at
                     the end of the one, five, or ten-year period (or fractional
portion thereof).                     
P   = an assumed initial payment of $1,000        

The returns which assume the contract is kept in-force will only be shown in    
conjunction with returns which assume the contract is surrendered.              

Midland National may also disclose the value of an assumed payment of $10,000   
(or other amounts) at the end of various periods of time.                       

Adjusted Historical Performance Data                                            

Midland National may also disclose adjusted historical performance data for an  
investment division for periods before the investment division commenced        
operations, based on the assumption that the investment division was in         
existence before it actually was, and that the investment division had been     
invested in a particular portfolio that was in existence prior to the investment
division's commencement of operations. The portfolio used for these calculations
will be the actual portfolio that the investment division will invest in.       

Adjusted historical performance data of this type will be calculated as follows.
First, the value of an assumed $1,000 investment in the applicable portfolio is 
calculated on a monthly basis by comparing the net asset value per share at the 
beginning of the month with the net asset value per share at the end of the     
month (adjusted for any dividend distributions during the month), and the       
resulting ratio is applied to the value of the investment at the beginning of   
the month to get the gross value of the investment at the end of the month.     
Second, that gross value is then reduced by a "contract charges" factor to      
reflect the charges imposed under the contract. The contract charges factor is  
calculated by taking the daily Separate Account asset charge and adding an      
additional amount that adjusts for the current annual $30 annual maintenance    
fee. This additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation     
value of $35,000 so it is calculated as $30/$35,000, or 0.09% annually. The     
total is then divided by 12 to get the monthly contract charges factor, which is
then applied to the value of the hypothetical initial payment in the applicable 
portfolio to get the value in the investment division. The contract charges     
factor is assumed to be deducted at the beginning of each month. In this manner,
the Ending Redeemable Value ("ERV") of a hypothetical $1,000 initial payment in 
the investment division is calculated each month during the applicable period,  
to get the ERV at the end of the period. Third, that ERV is then utilized in the
formulas above.                                                                 

This type of performance data may be disclosed on both an average annual total  
return and a cumulative total return basis. Moreover, it may be disclosed       
assuming that the contract is not surrendered (i.e., with no deduction for the  
contingent deferred sales charge) and assuming that the contract is surrendered 
at the end of the applicable period (i.e., reflecting a deduction for any       
applicable contingent deferred sales charge).                                   

 FEDERAL TAX MATTERS

Tax-Free Exchanges (Section 1035)                                               

Midland National accepts premiums, which are the proceeds of a contract in a    
transaction qualifying for a tax-free exchange under Section 1035 of the        
Internal Revenue Code. Except as required by federal law in calculating the     
basis of the contract, the Company does not differentiate between Section 1035  
premiums and non-Section 1035 premiums.                                         

We also accept "rollovers" from contracts qualifying as individual retirement   
annuities or accounts (IRAs), or any other Qualified contract which is eligible 
to "rollover" into an IRA (except 403(b) contracts). The Company differentiates 
between Non-Qualified contracts and IRAs to the extent necessary to comply with 
federal tax laws.                                                               

Required Distributions                                                          

In order to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes,  
section 72(s) of the code requires any Non-Qualified contract to provide that   
(a) if any owner dies on or after the annuity date but prior to the time the    
entire interest in the contract has been distributed, the remaining portion of  
such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of    
distribution being used as of the date of that owner's death; and (b) if any    
owner dies prior to the annuity starting date, the entire interest in the       
contract will be distributed (1) within five years after the date of that       
owner's death, or (2) as Annuity payments which will begin within one year of   
that owner's death and which will be made over the life of the owner's          
"designated beneficiary" or over a period not extending beyond the life         
expectancy of that beneficiary. The owner's "designated beneficiary" is the     
person to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of death and must be a
natural person. However, if the owner's designated beneficiary is the surviving 
spouse of the owner, the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as 
the new owner.                                                                  

The Non-Qualified contracts contain provisions which are intended to comply with
the requirements of section 72(s) of the Code, although no regulations          
interpreting these requirements have yet been issued. We intend to review such  
provisions and modify them if necessary to assure that they comply with the     
requirements of Code section 72(s) when clarified by regulation or otherwise.   

Other rules may apply to Qualified contracts.                                   

Non-Natural Person Owners                                                       

If a non-natural person (e.g., a corporation or a trust) owns a Non-Qualified   
contract, the taxpayer generally must include in income any increase in the     
excess of the account value over the investment in the contract (generally, the 
premiums or other consideration paid for the contract) during the taxable year. 

There are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a    
natural person should discuss these with a tax adviser.                         

The tax discussion in the prospectus and herein generally applies to contracts  
owned by natural persons.                                                       

Diversification Requirements                                                    

The Code requires that the investments of each investment division of the       
Separate Account underlying the contracts be "adequately diversified" in order  
for the contracts to be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax     
purposes. It is intended that each investment division, through the fund in     
which it invests, will satisfy these diversification requirements.              

Owner Control                                                                   

In some circumstances, owners of variable contracts who retain excessive control
over the investment of the underlying Separate Account assets may be treated as 
owners of those assets and may be subject to tax on income produced by those    
assets. Although published guidance in this area does not address certain       
aspects of the contracts, We believe that the owner of a contract should not be 
treated as the owner of the Separate Account assets. We reserve the right to    
modify the contracts to bring them into conformity with applicable standards    
should such modification be necessary to prevent owners of the contracts from   
being treated as the owners of the underlying Separate Account assets.          

Taxation of Qualified Contracts                                                 

The tax rules applicable to Qualified contracts vary according to the type of   
retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan. Your rights under a   
Qualified contract may be subject to the terms of the retirement plan itself,   
regardless of the terms of the Qualified contract. Adverse tax consequences may 
result if you do not ensure that contributions, distributions and other         
transactions with respect to the contract comply with the law.                  

Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), as defined in Section 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code), permit individuals to make annual contributions of up to   
the lesser of a specific dollar amount or the amount of compensation includible 
in the individual's gross income for the year. The contributions may be         
deductible in whole or in part, depending on the individual's income.           
Distributions from certain retirement plans may be "rolled over" into an IRA on 
a tax-deferred basis without regard to these limits. Amounts in the IRA (other  
than nondeductible contributions) are taxed when distributed from the IRA. A 10%
penalty tax generally applies to distributions made before age 59 1/2, unless   
certain exceptions apply.                                                       

Roth IRAs, as described in Code section 408A, permit certain eligible           
individuals to contribute to make non-deductible contributions to a Roth IRA in 
cash or as a rollover or transfer from another Roth IRA or other IRA. A rollover
from or conversion of an IRA to a Roth IRA is generally subject to tax and other
special rules apply. The owner may wish to consult a tax adviser before         
combining any converted amounts with any other Roth IRA contributions, including
any other conversion amounts from other tax years. Distributions from a Roth IRA
generally are not taxed, except that, once aggregate distributions exceed       
contributions to the Roth IRA, income tax and a 10% penalty tax may apply to    
distributions made (1) before age 59 1/2 (subject to certain exceptions) or (2) 
during the five taxable years starting with the year in which the first         
contribution is made to any Roth IRA. A 10% penalty tax may apply to amounts    
attributable to a conversion from an IRA if they are distributed during the five
taxable years beginning with the year in which the conversion was made.         

Corporate pension and profit-sharing plans under Section 401(a) of the Code     
allow corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for    
employees, and self-employed individuals to establish qualified plans for       
themselves and their employees. Adverse tax consequences to the retirement plan,
the participant or both may result if the contract is transferred to any        
individual as a means to provide benefit payments, unless the plan complies with
all the requirements applicable to such benefits prior to transferring the      
contract.                                                                       

Tax Sheltered Annuities under section 403(b) of the Code allow employees of     
certain Section 501(c)(3) organizations and public schools to exclude from their
gross income the premium payments made, within certain limits, on a contract    
that will provide an annuity for the employee's retirement. These premium       
payments may be subject to FICA (social security) tax.                          

Distributions of (1) salary reduction contributions made in years beginning     
after December 31, 1988; (2) earnings on those contributions; and (3) earnings  
on amounts held as of the last year beginning before January 1, 1989, are not   
allowed prior to age 59 1/2, severance from employment, death or disability.    
Salary reduction contributions may also be distributed upon hardship, but would 
generally be subject to penalties.                                              

Section 457 Plans, while not actually providing for a qualified plan as that    
term is normally used, provides for certain deferred compensation plans with    
respect to service for state governments, local governments, political          
subdivisions, agencies, instrumentalities and certain affiliates of such        
entities, and tax exempt organizations. The contract can be used with such      
plans. Under such plans a participant may specify the form of investment in     
which his or her participation will be made. Under a non-governmental plan, all 
such investments, however, are owned by and are subject to, the claims of the   
general creditors of the sponsoring employer. In general, all amounts received  
under a section 457 plan are taxable and are subject to federal income tax      
withholding as wages.

Item 27. Number of Contract Owners                                              
As of the date of this filing, no contracts have been sold.

Item 28. Indemnification
Midland National Life Insurance Company indemnifies actions against all         
officers, directors, and employees to the full extent permitted by Iowa law.    
This includes any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, 
whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative. Such indemnification 
includes expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement of such     
actions, suits, or proceedings.                                                 

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the     
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant   
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,   
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred 
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the   
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such       
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being 
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate     
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public  
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by final adjudication of    
such issue.                                                                     

Item 29a. Relationship of Principal Underwriter to Other Investment Companies   

In addition to Midland National Life Separate Account C, Sammons Securities     
Company LLC, the principal underwriter of the Registrant, is also the principal 
underwriter for flexible premium variable life insurance policies issued through
Midland National Life Separate Account A and North American Separate Account VUL
I and flexible premium variable annuity contracts issued through North American 
Separate Account VAI.                                                           

Item 29b. Principal Underwriters

   Contract, the attached written application and any attached endorsements,
riders, and amendments.                                               

2.2  Changes To The Contract: No one has the right to change any part of this   
     Contract or to waive any of its provisions unless the change is approved in
    writing by one of Our officers. Only our President or Secretary may modify
this Contract.                                                        

 We may change this Contract without Your consent to conform to state or
federal laws or regulations. A change will be made by attaching an

2.3  Beneficiary: You named the Beneficiary in the application. A Beneficiary is
 revocable unless otherwise stated in the Beneficiary designation. If no
 Primary Beneficiary is living at the time of the Owner's or Annuitant's
   death, the proceeds are payable to the Contingent Beneficiary, if any. If
no Beneficiary is living when the Owner or Annuitant dies, the death  
    benefit will be paid to You or Your estate. If there are joint Owners, the
  surviving joint Owner, if any, will be considered the designated Primary
  Beneficiary, unless the joint Owners have otherwise designated a Primary
     Beneficiary either on the application or by sending Us a Written Notice. If
a person other than a joint Owner is named a Primary Beneficiary, the 
surviving Owner will not be entitled to proceeds upon the death of the

receive Written Notice informing Us of the change. Upon receipt and

Written Notice.                                                       

2.5  Change In Maturity Date: At any time You may change the Maturity Date by   
    Written Notice. We must receive Your Written Notice requesting such change
     at least 30 days prior to the original Maturity Date. Any Maturity Date may
     not be a date that is before the end of the first day of the fifth contract
year.                                                                 

2.6  Incontestability: We will not contest this Contract.                       

2.7  Misstatement Of Age Or Sex: If the age or sex of the Annuitant has been

the applied value would have purchased at the correct age and sex.    

  Any underpayments made by Us will be paid to the Payee. Any overpayments
   made by Us will be charged against benefits falling due after adjustment.
All underpayments and overpayments will include interest at the rate  
required by the jurisdiction in which this Contract is delivered.     

2.8  Periodic Reports: At least once each year, We will send You a report       
containing information required by applicable state law.

  profits of the Company and the Company does not pay any dividends on it.

2.10 Claims Of Creditors: To the extent permitted by law, no benefits payable   
    under this Contract to a Beneficiary or Payee are subject to the claims of
creditors.                                                            

2.11 Minimum Benefits: The annuity payments, Surrender Value and death benefit  
   under this Contract are not less than the minimum required by the laws of
the state in which this Contract is delivered.                        

2.12 Payment Of Premiums: The Initial Premium is due on the Issue Date. You may

the limits shown on the Specifications Page.                          

2.13 Ownership: This Contract belongs to You. You have all rights granted by    
this Contract, including the right to change Owners and Beneficiaries,
subject to the rights of:                                             

1)   Any assignee of record with Us;                                  

2)   Any irrevocable Beneficiary; and                                 

3)   Any restricted Ownership.                                        

   We must receive Written Notice informing Us of any change, designation or

("SEC") or                                                  

2)   The SEC determines that an emergency exists that would make the  
        disposal of securities held in the Separate Account or determination
of their value not reasonably practicable.                  

SECTION 3: YOUR INVESTMENT OPTIONS

3.1   The Fixed Account: The Fixed Account is an account in which premiums      
  allocated to the Fixed Account, less Partial Surrenders allocated from
the Fixed Account, plus or minus transfers to or from the Fixed     
Account, accumulated at a specified interest rate for each Fixed    
Account Option. The total amount of premium that can be allocated or
transferred to the Fixed Account in any Contract Year is limited. Up
 to 50% of each premium deposit may be allocated to the Fixed Account.
 If the Fixed Account Value is 50% or more of the overall Accumulation
Value, premiums may not be allocated to the Fixed Account. A premium
deposit cannot bring the Fixed Account Value to more than 50% of the
 overall Accumulation Value. The maximum increase to the Fixed Account
in any Contract Year is shown on the Specifications Page. The sum of
all allocations plus all transfers within a Contract Year cannot    
exceed this maximum amount without prior approval from Us. The total
 amount of premium that can be allocated to the Fixed Account prior to
the Maturity Date is limited. This limit cannot be exceeded without 
prior approval from Us. The maximum amount of premium that can be   
allocated and/or transferred to the Fixed Account prior to Maturity 
Date is shown on the Specifications Page.                           

The Fixed Account has three different options in which You may      
allocate Your money: the Traditional Fixed Account, the Multi-Year  
Guarantee Options and the Fixed Account Dollar Cost Averaging. The  
  specified interest rate for each Fixed Account Option will not be less
than the Fixed Account Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rate shown on the
Specifications Page.                                                

3.2   Traditional Fixed Account: At the time of application and anytime         
thereafter, You can choose to allocate a portion of Your premium to 
the Traditional Fixed Account. These premiums are subject to all of 
the Fixed Account premium and transfer limitations described above. 
This option will earn interest at the Current Interest Rate. The    
  Current Interest Rate on the Issue Date is shown on the Specifications
Page and is applicable to the Initial Premium allocated to the      
 Traditional Fixed Account. The Current Interest Rate, as shown on the
Specifications Page, is guaranteed for the first year. An interest  
rate will be declared annually on each Contract Anniversary for the 
Traditional Fixed Account. We will also declare the Current Interest
Rate for any subsequent premiums or amounts transferred to the Fixed
Account. The Fixed Account Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rate is shown
on the Specifications Page.                                         

3.3   Fixed Account Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA): At the time of application     
only, You may elect one of two Fixed Account DCA programs. These    
programs allow You to have a specific amount of Your Initial Premium
  transferred each month to the investment divisions of Your choice. You
may choose either a 6-Month Fixed Account DCA Program or a 12-Month 
Fixed Account DCA Program. The interest rate for the Program You    
choose is shown on the Specifications Page. You will choose how the 
DCA premium will be allocated. These allocations cannot be changed  
during the program period.                                          

3.4   Multi-Year Guarantee (MYG) Options: At the time of application only,      
  You can choose to allocate some of Your Initial Premium to one or more
of the MYG Options available under this contract. You can transfer  
money out of the MYG Options (subject to the Fixed Account transfer 
  limitations and an interest adjustment), but You cannot transfer funds
  or allocate future premium into the MYG Options. The declared interest
  rate for each MYG Option is shown on the Specifications Page. For each
MYG Option, the interest rate is guaranteed for the entire length of
 the guarantee period. At the end of each MYG Option guarantee period,
there is no re-entry into a new guarantee period. The money will be 
automatically transferred into the Traditional Fixed Account with no
surrender charges or interest adjustment.                           

3.5   The Separate Account: The Separate Account is Our Separate Account C,     
established under the Insurance Laws of the State of Iowa, and is a 
unit investment trust registered with the SEC under the Investment  
Company Act of 1940. It is also subject to the laws of Iowa. We own 
the assets of the account; We keep them separate from the assets of 
the Fixed Account(s). We established the account to support variable
annuity contracts.                                                  

3.6   Initial Allocation: The Initial Premium will be allocated to the          
 selected Fixed and Separate Accounts on the Issue Date. The amount of
premium that can be allocated to the Fixed Account is subject to the
premium allocation limitations in Section 3.1 above.                

3.7   Allocations: The Separate Account has several investment divisions. We    
list them in the application and in the prospectus. You determine,  
  using percentages, how Premiums will be allocated to the Fixed Account
 or among the investment divisions. You may choose to allocate nothing
to the Fixed Account or to a particular investment division. The    
amount of premium that can be allocated to the Fixed Account is     
  subject to the premium allocation limitations in Section 3.1 above. In
 addition, any allocation must be a whole number; You may not choose a
fractional percent. The amount allocated to an Account must be at   
least equal to the Minimum Account Value shown on the Specifications
Page. The maximum amount of premium that We will accept is shown on 
the Specifications Page.                                            

We reserve the right to limit the number of investment divisions in 
which You have funds invested.                                      

You may change the allocation for subsequent premiums at any time   
while the Contract is in force. To do so, You must send Us Written  
Notice. The change will take effect on the date We receive Written  
Notice at Our Principal Office.                                     

3.8   Transfers Prior To Maturity Date: You generally may transfer amounts      
between the investment divisions of the Separate Account or between 
the Fixed Account and any investment division prior to the Maturity 
Date, provided you make the request to transfer such amounts in     
writing to Us. Transfers from the Separate Account to the Fixed     
  Account may not occur if the Fixed Account Value is 50% or more of the
overall Accumulation Value. The amount that You can transfer into or
  out of the Fixed Account is limited as defined in Sections 3.1 and 3.7
above. The minimum amount You may transfer is shown in the          
Specifications Page. This minimum need not come from any one        
 investment division or be transferred to any one investment division.
The minimum applies to the net amounts being transferred in Your    
 written request. The Maximum Number of Free Transfers You may make in
  each Contract Year without charge is shown in the Specifications Page.
For each additional transfer there is a charge which will not exceed
the Maximum Transfer Charge shown in the Specifications Page. This  
charge will be deducted from the investment divisions, or the Fixed 
Account from which the transfer is being made in equal proportion to
the number of such investment divisions, or the Fixed Account on the
day of the transfer. The amount remaining in any investment division
 after deducting the transfer and any transfer charge must be equal to
 or greater than zero. The maximum amount that can be transferred from
 the Fixed Account to the Separate Account in any Contract Year is 20%
of the Fixed Account Value on the first day of the Contract Year.   

  You may also request to transfer amounts out of the MYG Options (which
will be subject to an interest adjustment), subject to the transfer 
limitations in Sections 3.1 and 3.7 above.                          

We reserve the right to restrict or refuse transfers under this     
 Contract. If we exercise this right, You will be notified in writing.

3.9   Transfers After The Maturity Date: You may request two transfers among    
the Separate Account investment divisions each Contract Year. No    
transfers are allowed in or out of the Fixed Account.               

3.10  Account Investments: We use the assets of Our Separate Account to buy     
shares in the Funds. Each investment division is invested in a      
corresponding specific portfolio. Income and realized and unrealized
  gains and losses from Our shares in each portfolio are credited to, or
charged against, the investment division. This is without regard to 
income, gains, or losses in Our other investment accounts.          

 We will always keep assets in the Separate Account with a total value
at least equal to the Accumulation Values under contracts like this 
  one. To the extent those assets do not exceed this amount, We use them
 only to support those policies; We do not use those assets to support
 any other business We conduct. We may use any excess over this amount
in any way We choose.                                               

3.11  Change In Investment Policy: A portfolio of the Funds may make a          
material change in its Investment Policy. In that case, We will send
You a notice of the change. Within 60 days after You receive the    
notice, or within 60 days after the effective date of the change, if
  later, You may transfer any amount You have in the investment division
affected by the Investment Policy change to another investment      
division of Our Separate Account. The process for changing the      
Investment Policy of the Separate Account has been approved by Iowa,
Our state of domicile, and the process for doing so is on file with 
the Insurance Commissioner in the state in which this Contract is   
delivered.                                                          

3.12  Change Of Fund: A portfolio might, in Our judgment, become unsuitable     
  for investment by an investment division. This may happen because of a
 change in investment contract, or a change in laws or regulations, or
  because the shares are no longer available for investment, or for some
 other reason. If that occurs, We have the right to substitute another
 portfolio of the Funds, or to invest in a Fund other than the ones We
show on the application. However, We would first seek approval from 
the SEC and, where required, the insurance regulator where this     
Contract is delivered.                                              

SECTION 4: ACCUMULATION VALUES

4.1  Fixed Account Value: The Fixed Account Value equals:                       

1)   Your Initial Premium allocated to the Fixed Account; plus        

  2)   Subsequent premiums allocated to the Fixed Account, if any; plus or
minus                                                       

3)   Any transfers in or out of the Fixed Account Options (before any 
applicable Interest Adjustment); less                       

    4)   Any Partial Surrenders allocated to the Fixed Account Options (before
        any applicable Interest Adjustment, if allocated in the MYG Options,
or reduction of Surrender Charges); less                    

5)   The Annual Maintenance Fee and transfer charges if any; plus     

6)   Interest credited at the specified interest rate for each Fixed  
Account Option.                                             

4.2  Separate Account Value: The amount You have in Our Separate Account at any 
   time will be the sum of the values in each investment division. The value
in each investment division is equal to (a) multiplied by (b) where:  

   a.   is the Accumulation Unit Value as of the end of the Valuation Period
 for which the value in the investment division is determined.

b.   is the number of Accumulation Units in the investment division;  

    We guarantee that adverse mortality and expense experience will not affect
the amount You have in Our Separate Account.                          

4.3  Accumulation Units: We will credit amounts to or deduct amounts from the   
    investment divisions in the Separate Account C in the form of Accumulation
  Units prior to the Maturity Date. The number of Accumulation Units to be
 credited or deducted from any investment division will be determined by
     dividing the amount to be credited or deducted from the investment division
 by the Accumulation Unit Value of the investment division. Accumulation
   Units will be credited or deducted using the Unit Value for the Valuation
  Period during which the transaction occurs. 4.4 Accumulation Unit Value:
   The Accumulation Unit Value of each investment division was set at $10.00
    on the first Valuation Period of the investment division. The Accumulation
     Unit Value for each subsequent Valuation Period is determined at the end of
 the Valuation Period and will be equal to the Net Investment Factor for
 that Valuation Period multiplied by the Accumulation Unit Value for the
   immediately preceding Valuation Period. The Accumulation Unit Value for a
   Valuation Period applies to each day in the period. The Accumulation Unit
Value may increase or decrease from one Valuation Period to the next. 

4.5  Net Investment Factor: The Net Investment Factor is an index used to       
measure the investment performance of an investment division from one 
   Valuation Period to the next. The Net Investment Factor can be greater or
less than one; therefore, the value of an investment division unit may
increase or decrease.                                                 

The Net Investment Factor for each investment division for a Valuation
Period is determined by adding (a) and (b), subtracting (c) and then  
dividing the result by (a) where:                                     

(a)  is the value of the assets at the end of the preceding Valuation 
Period;                                                     

  (b)  is the investment income and capital gains, realized or unrealized,
credited during the current Valuation Period; and           

(c)  is the sum of:                                                   

       1.   the capital losses, realized or unrealized, charged during the
               current Valuation Period plus any amount charged or set aside for
taxes during the current Valuation Period; plus   

     2.   the mortality and expense charge for each day in the current
Valuation Period.                                 

4.6  Charges Against The Investment Division: In determining the values for the 
     Accumulation Units, We deduct the mortality and expense charge, as shown on
    the Specifications Page, from the assets of each investment division. This
charge is for mortality and expense risks that We assume.             

   The earnings of the Separate Account are taxed as part of Our operations.
 At the present time, We do not expect to incur taxes on earnings of any
 investment division to the extent that earnings are credited under this
     Contract. If We incur additional taxes due to the operation of the Separate
Account, We may make charges for such taxes against the investment    
divisions.                                                            

(1)                                                                   

(2)  SECTION 5: SURRENDERS                                            

5.1  Surrender: You may surrender this Contract for its Surrender Value at any  
    time prior to the Maturity Date. The Surrender Value will be determined as
    of the first Business Day that We receive Written Notice and the Contract.

We may defer payment of the Surrender Value for up to six months. If  
   payment is deferred for 30 or more days, interest at the rate required by
  the jurisdiction in which this Contract is delivered will be paid during
the period of deferment.                                              

5.2  Surrender Value: The Surrender Value is equal to:                          

1)   The Fixed Account Value; plus                                    

2)   Any applicable Interest Adjustment(s); plus                      

3)   The Separate Account Value; less                                 

4)   The Surrender Charge; less                                       

5)   The Annual Maintenance Fee (if any); less                        

6)   Any applicable Premium Tax.                                      

5.3  Interest Adjustment: We may make an interest adjustment on amounts         
withdrawn from any Multi-Year Guarantee Option before the end of the  
     guarantee period. Each MYG Option will have a separate Interest Adjustment.

 An applicable interest adjustment will be calculated by multiplying the
amount withdrawn before the reduction of any surrender charge by the  
formula described below:                                              

[(1+io - .005)/(1 + it)]^(T) - 1                          

io = The current interest rate on the MYG Option(s)       
(excluding any additional interest) when this Contract was
issued.                                                   

it = The current interest rate on the MYG Option(s)       
    (excluding any additional interest) offered for new Contracts.

T= Time in years as follows:                              

   Number of days from the date of the partial or full surrender
  to the end of the current Contract Year divided by 365; plus
whole number of years remaining in the guarantee period.  

   Upon full surrender or full transfer out of an MYG Option(s), an Interest
    Adjustment, either positive or negative, will be limited to the difference
 between the MYG Option(s) Account Value and the Minimum Guaranteed Fund
Value.                                                                

     An interest adjustment will be made on each MYG Option during the guarantee
  period on a full or partial surrender, penalty-free surrender, transfers
   out of the MYG Option and upon annuitization. No interest adjustment will
be made upon death or at the end of the guarantee period when the MYG 
     Option money is automatically transferred to the Traditional Fixed Account.

5.4  Minimum Guaranteed Fund Value: The Minimum Guaranteed Fund Value (MGFV) is 
only applied to the MYG Options and will be no less than:             

1)   100% of MYG premiums; less                                       

  2)   Any Partial Surrenders allocated to or any transfers out of the MYG
       Options (before any applicable Interest Adjustments or reduction of
Surrender Charges); plus                                    

    3)   Interest earned at the Fixed Account Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rate
shown on the Specifications Page; less                      

4)   The Annual Maintenance Fee and transfer charges, if any.         

5.5  Surrender Charges: We may deduct a Surrender Charge from any surrender of  
premiums. The charge is equal to:                                     

1)   The Net Premium; less                                            

   2)   The Penalty-Free Partial Surrender amount (if available); multiplied
by                                                          

3)   The Surrender Charge percentage shown on the Specifications Page.

The Surrender Charge will be based on the length of time between each 
    premium payment and surrender. The Surrender Charge Percentage is shown on
  the Specifications Page. Any amount that You withdraw will be treated as
   being from premiums first, and then from investment income, if any. There
is no Surrender Charge on the investment income (if any) withdrawn.   

i.                                                          

ii.  SECTION 6: PARTIAL SURRENDERS                          

6.1  Partial Surrenders: You may withdraw part of the Accumulation Value at any 
 time before the Maturity Date, subject to the Minimum Partial Surrender
    Amount shown on the Specifications Page. A Partial Surrender may not bring
    the Fixed Account Value or any investment division of the Separate Account
 Value below the Minimum Account Value shown on the Specifications Page.

 The Minimum Partial Surrender Amount does not apply if You exercise the
Penalty-Free Partial Surrender as described in Section 6.2.           

We may defer payment of the Partial Surrender for up to six months.   
            If payment is deferred for 30 or more days, interest at the rate
            required by the jurisdiction in which this Contract is delivered
will be paid during the period of deferment.        

 Unless  you specify otherwise, Your Partial Surrender will be allocated
             among all investment divisions, the Traditional Fixed Account and
         the MYG Option(s) in the same proportion as Your Accumulation
          Value bears to each investment division, the Traditional Fixed
         Account and the MYG Options(s). This allocation is subject to
minimum amount requirements.                        

6.2  Penalty-Free Partial Surrenders: Once in each Contract Year You may        
withdraw up to 10% of the Gross Premium as of the date of the Partial 
Surrender without any Surrender Charge.                               

   If this option is not exercised during any Contract Year, or if less than
           10% is withdrawn, any unused amount will not be carried over to a
subsequent Contract Year.                             

An Interest Adjustment will be applied to Penalty-Free Partial Surrenders if    
money is withdrawn from the MYG Options.                                        

6.3  Surrender Charges: We will deduct a Surrender Charge upon any Partial      
  Surrender in excess of the allowable Penalty-Free Partial Surrender. The
charge is equal to:                                                   

4)   The amount requested that is withdrawn from Net Premium; less    

   5)   The Penalty-Free Partial Surrender amount (if available); multiplied
by                                                          

6)   The Surrender Charge percentage shown on the Specifications Page.

The Surrender Charge will be based on the length of time between      
       premium payments and Partial Surrenders. For the purpose of
          determining the Surrender Charge, any amount that You withdraw
       will be treated as being from premiums first, and then from
       investment income, if any, without regard to allocations of
          premiums or surrenders among investment divisions. There is no
         Surrender Charge on the investment income (if any) withdrawn.

iii. SECTION 7: SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL OPTION

You may elect a Systematic Withdrawal Option if all of the following  
requirements are satisfied as of the date we receive your request:    

1)   The Annuitant is living,                                         

2)   The Contract has not reached the Maturity Date, and              

3)   Your right to examine the Contract has expired.                  

  All Systematic Withdrawals are considered Partial Surrenders and will be
  taken pro-rata from the Traditional Fixed Account, the MYG Option(s) and
the Separate Accounts. Withdrawals may be made monthly, quarterly,    
semi-annually or annually. However, We reserve the right to change the
   frequency of payments or discontinue payments if the payment is less than
$200. Systematic Withdrawals will be delayed until the last day of the
Valuation Period in which they fall.                                  

    Surrender Charges will apply to all Systematic Withdrawal amounts that are
     in excess of the Penalty-Free Partial Surrender amount. You may discontinue
Systematic Withdrawals at any time.                                   

   The balance remaining in the Accumulation Value will continue to increase
or decrease, depending on the investment experience of the investment 
  divisions in which Your Accumulation Value resides. If Your Accumulation
Value declines due to unscheduled withdrawals or due to the investment
experience, Your Accumulation Value may no longer support Systematic  
Withdrawals.                                                          

SECTION 8: DEATH BENEFIT

8.1  Death Of Annuitant Before The Maturity Date: If the Annuitant, who is not  
     the Owner, dies prior to the Maturity Date We will pay the death benefit to
the appropriate Annuitant's Beneficiary. This death benefit can be    
distributed over the life of the Annuitant's Beneficiary as long as an
     election is made within 60 days after the Annuitant's death. If an election
  is not made within 60 days, the death benefit will be paid in a lump sum
    and will be taxable in the year of death. The death benefit is the greater
 of Net Premium or the Accumulation Value on the date We receive the due
Proof of Death, increased by interest at the rate required by the     
     jurisdiction in which this Contract is issued until the date of payment and
less any applicable Premium Tax.                                      

If there are joint Annuitants, the death benefit will be paid upon the
death of the second Annuitant. If any Owner predeceases the second    
 Annuitant, the death benefit will be distributed upon the death of such
Owner according to Section 8.2 below.                                 

     If the deceased Annuitant is also an Owner, or would be treated as an Owner
   under Section 8.2 below then the provisions of Section 8.2 will apply and
    control the distribution of the death benefit payable under this Contract.

8.2  Death Of Owner Before The Maturity Date: If the Owner dies prior to the    
 Maturity Date, we will pay the death benefit to the appropriate Owner's
   Beneficiary. This death benefit must be distributed within 5 years of the
deceased Owner's death; or provided the Owner's Beneficiary is an     
individual, it may be distributed over the lifetime of the Owner's    
Beneficiary, as long as payments begin within one year of the deceased
   Owner's death. The death benefit is the greater of the Net Premium or the
Accumulation Value on the date We receive Proof of Death, increased by
 interest at the rate required by the jurisdiction in which the deceased
   Owner resided at the time of death until the date of payment and less any
applicable Premium Tax.                                               

 If the Owner's Beneficiary dies after the deceased Owner but before the
entire interest in this Contract has been distributed, any remaining  
distributions will be made to the Owner's Beneficiary's estate.       

   If there are joint Owners, the surviving joint Owner, if any, will be the
 Primary Beneficiary unless the joint Owners have otherwise designated a
  Primary Beneficiary either on the application or by sending Us a Written
     Notice. If someone other than a joint Owner is named a Primary Beneficiary,
    the surviving Owner will not be entitled to proceeds upon the death of the
    first Owner. Proceeds will be distributed on the death of the first Owner,
  unless the sole Beneficiary is the spouse. In which case, the spouse may
  elect to continue this Contract as the new Owner as described in Section
8.3 below.                                                            

     Payments under this provision are in full settlement of all liability under
this Contract.                                                        

8.3  Spousal Continuance: If the Owner dies, and the sole Beneficiary is the    
deceased Owner's spouse, the Beneficiary may elect to continue this   
Contract as the new Owner.                                            

8.4  Death Of Annuitant Or Owner On Or After The Maturity Date: If the Annuitant
   or Owner dies on or after the Maturity Date and before the entire annuity
benefit is distributed and the surviving spouse is not the sole       
beneficiary, any remaining balance will be paid at least as rapidly as
under the payment option in effect upon the date of death.            

8.5  Simultaneous Death: If joint Owners or joint Annuitants die within 24 hours
of one another they are considered to have died simultaneously and the
 eldest is presumed to have died first. In the event of the simultaneous
  death of the Owner and the Annuitant, the Owner is presumed to have died
first, and the Owner's beneficiary would be paid the death benefit.   

 SECTION 9: PAY-OUT PROVISIONS

9.1  Payment Of Contract Proceeds: On the Maturity Date, We will pay the        
   Surrender Value of this Contract, less any applicable Premium Tax, to the
    Annuitant if living. You may elect to have the value paid under one of the
   payment plans described below. You can choose either a Fixed Payment Plan
  described in Section 9.4 or a Variable Payment Plan described in Section
 9.6. The election of a payment plan must be made in writing at least 30
days prior to the Maturity Date. If no election is made, the automatic
   Fixed Payment Plan of a life annuity with 10 year certain period (monthly
    income for a minimum of 120 months and as long thereafter as the Annuitant
lives) will be applied.                                               

     If the Surrender Value on the Maturity Date is less than $2,500, the annual
payment is less than $50, or the Payee is a corporation, partnership, 
association, trustee or assignee, We reserve the right to pay the full
value to the Owner in a lump sum cash payment.                        

9.2  Frequency Of Annuity Payments: Annuity payments will be made monthly,      
     unless a different mode of payment is elected. If monthly payments would be
 less than $50, We reserve the right to change the payment frequency, so
that payments are at least $50.                                       

9.3  Fixed Payment Options: Payments and earnings under the Fixed Payment       
 Options are not affected by the investment experience of any investment
  division of Our Separate Account. Interest credited on all Fixed Payment
Options will never be less than 1.5%.                                 

9.4  Fixed Payment Plans: Annuity Payments will be made under one of the        
following payment plans:                                              

Option 1 - Income for Specified Period: We will pay an income for a   
     specific number of years in equal installments. We guarantee these payments
to be at least those shown in Table 1.                                

    Installments shown are for each $1,000 of value applied based on a minimum
interest of 1.5% per annum.                                           

   At Our sole discretion, excess interest may be paid or credited from time
to time in addition to the payments guaranteed under Option 1.        

Option 2 - Life Annuity:                                              

     Life Annuity: We will pay equal monthly payments during the lifetime of the
Payee. Upon the death of the Payee, payments will cease.              

With Certain Period: We will pay equal monthly payments for a selected
    number of guaranteed payments, and then for as long as the Payee is living
thereafter.                                                           

We guarantee these payments to be at least those shown in Table 2.    

   Installments shown are for each $1,000 of value applied, based on Annuity
2000 Tables and a minimum interest of 1.5% per annum.                 

  Option 3 - Income for a Specified Amount: We pay income of the specified
     amount until the principal and interest are exhausted. The specified amount
  is subject to the limitation that principal and interest must be payable
for at least 5 years, and must be exhausted at the end of 20 years.   
Payments will begin on the Maturity Date and will continue until the  
principal and interest, at the rate of 1.5% compounded per annum, are 
exhausted.                                                            

   Option 4 - Joint and Survivor Income: We will pay monthly payments during
the lifetime of the Annuitant and the named Beneficiary, provided the 
     Annuitant is at least 50 years old and the Beneficiary/Payee is at least 45
years old at the time of the first monthly payment. We determine the  
 payment by the sex and age of each person from Table 3. We will furnish
values for age or sex combinations not shown in the table on request. 

  Installments shown are monthly and are for each $1,000 of value applied,
based on Annuity 2000 Tables and a minimum interest of 1.5% per annum.

9.5  Variable Payment Options: Payments under the Variable Payment Options are  
  affected by the investment experience of the investment divisions of Our
Separate Account. Therefore, the amount of the Variable Payments may  
increase or decrease, depending on the investment experience of the   
investment division.                                                  

    We guarantee that adverse mortality and expense experience will not affect
the dollar amount of the Variable Payment.                            

9.6  Variable Payment Plans: Annuity payments will be made under one of the     
following payment plans:                                              

Life Annuity: We will pay monthly payments during the lifetime of the 
Payee. Upon the death of the Payee, payments will cease.              

Life Annuity With Certain Period: We will pay monthly payments for a  
   selected number of guaranteed payments, and then for as long as the Payee
is living thereafter.                                                 

    The dollar amount of the first Variable Payment is computed by multiplying
  the amount in each investment division, calculated as of a date not more
than ten Business Days prior to the date of the first payment, by the 
 appropriate rate from Table 4 for the option selected. The payment from
   each investment division is then converted to Annuity Units which will be
used to determine subsequent payments.                                

   The initial payments shown in Table 4 are monthly and are for each $1,000
of value applied, based on Annuity 2000 Tables and interest of 5% per 
annum.                                                                

The number of Annuity Units credited to each investment division is:  

a)   the portion of the first Variable Payment from the investment    
division; divided by                                        

  b)   the investment division's Annuity Unit Value as of the date used to
calculate the first Variable Payment.                       

    The dollar amount of each subsequent payment for an investment division is
equal to:                                                             

   a)   the number of Annuity Units for that investment division; multiplied
by                                                          

    b)   the Annuity Unit Value for that investment division as of a uniformly
       applied date not more than ten Business Days before the date of the
payment.                                                    

The Variable Payment made to the Annuitant is the sum of the payment  
amounts for each investment division.                                 

9.7  Annuity Unit Value: The Annuity Unit Value of each investment division was 
  set at $10.00 at the end of the first Valuation Period of the investment
division. The unit value for each subsequent Valuation Period is then 
determined at the end of the Valuation Period and is equal to:        

     a)   the Annuity Unit Value for the immediately preceding Valuation Period;
multiplied by                                               

b)   the Net Investment Factor for that period; multiplied by         

c)   .99986634 for each day in the Valuation Period.                  

9.8  Additional Payment Plans: Annuity payments may be made under any payment   
plan offered by Us at the time an election is made.                   

9.9  Evidence Of Age And Survival: Income under Options 2 and 3 of the Fixed    
Payment Plans or any Variable Payment Plan is based on the age of each
  Payee. We require proof of age. We reserve the right to require proof of
survival under these Options.                                         

 SECTION 10: ANNUITIZATION BONUS

  When You annuitize Your contract after the fourth contract year, We will
   credit Your Accumulation Value with an additional percentage based on the
Pay-Out Option You choose as follows:                                 

a)   [2%] annuitization bonus will be credited on any Pay-Out Option  
         available under this Contract that guarantees payment for ten or more
years.                                                      

b)   [1%] annuitization bonus will be credited on any Pay-Out Option  
        available under this Contract that guarantees payment for nine years
or less.

Account C filed on form N-4 (File number 333-119088 Pre-Effective Amendment No.

authorized and existing separate account established pursuant to the  
provisions of the Iowa Statutes.                                      

3.   The flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts, when issued as   
contemplated by said Form N-4 Registration Statement, will constitute 
legal, validly issued and binding obligations of Midland National Life
Insurance Company.

About Midland National Life Insurance
Since 1906, Midland National Life Insurance Company has provided fixed annuities and life insurance policies to individuals and families across the United States. Originally founded as Dakota Mutual Life Insurance Company, and assuming the name Midland National Life Insurance Company in 1925, the company dedicates itself to preserving its legacy of providing insurance financial services that protect individuals and families alike.
Midland National has enjoyed steady growth, stability, and industry success through its annuities and life insurance solutions for more than 110 years. An essential part of continuing that tradition of stability is the organization’s broad product portfolio designed to fit the individual needs of both personal and business policyholders, and its focus on long-term, sustained growth and, outstanding achievements of agents, distribution partners and employees.
Midland National Offerings
Trust is perhaps the most valuable commodity in the insurance business. Life insurance and annuities offer financial protection for individuals and families. It's important to trust that the company providing this financial protection will be around for the long-term.
Midland National's independent agents offer a wide array of products to suit many individual needs:

•  Fixed index, traditional fixed and immediate annuities: Designed to produce long-term gains with guarantees backed by the financial strength of Midland National. Independent  agents appointed by Midland National help guide customers in seeking insurance products suitable for their individual needs employing state-by-state buying guides to help ensure clients have all needed information to make the best decision for their situation
•  Life insurance*: Midland's independent agents also offer term, whole, universal, indexed universal and variable2 universal life insurance policies to provide policyowners and beneficiaries with financial protection. Midland National knows the value and importance of having the right policy in place, and weighing all factors involved in helping determine which policies are right for each individual.

				*Life insurance policies have terms under which the policy may be continued inforce or discontinued. Current risk rates and interest rates are not guaranteed. Therefore, the planned periodic premium may not be sufficient to carry the contract to maturity. For Indexed Universal Life policies, the Index Accounts are subject to caps and participation rates and in no case will the interest credited be less than 0 percent. The policy's death benefit is paid upon the death of the insured. The policy does not continue to accumulate cash value and excess interest after the insured's death. Please refer to the customized illustration provided by your agent for additional detail. For costs and complete details, call or write Midland National Life Insurance Company, Administrative Office, One Sammons Plaza Sioux Falls, SD 57193. Telephone: (605) 335-5700.

Midland National Life Insurance



About Midland National Company
In 1906, the company that would eventually evolve into Midland National Life Insurance Company was founded on a late summer evening in the Black Hills of South Dakota. To capitalize the new company, its six directors were required to apply for a $1,000 life insurance policy and pay an assessment of $300. They paid their first claim in 1908.
Midland National Life Insurance Says
Midland National Life offers five different forms of life insurance. These are term, whole, universal, indexed universal and variable universal. Term-life insurance is a temporary and affordable coverage option that can be converted into a permanent policy if financial circumstances change. Whole life insurance is a policy that offers the security of level premiums and guaranteed permanent coverage. Universal life insurance offers whole life coverage and the flexibility of adjusting premiums and death benefits. Indexed universal life insurance offers death benefit guarantees. It also gives the insured the opportunity to earn interest linked with the upward movement of a stock market index without the risk of investing directly in the market. Variable universal life insurance provides a guaranteed death benefit and the opportunity for the insured to invest their premiums in various separate account investment portfolios.

Life insurance: Why it matters and how to shop for it


You work hard to provide a good life for your family, and you'd do anything to protect them. But what would happen to them financially if you died tomorrow?
If the answer troubles you, then you need life insurance. Life insurance provides a safety net tomorrow for the loved ones who depend on you today.
But where should you start? There are two main types of coverage are available: term life and permanent life insurance. The first step is to decide which of these suits you best.
Term vs. permanent life insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a certain period, such as 10, 15 or 20 years. Buyers typically choose a policy that covers them until their mortgages and other debts are paid off, or the kids have graduated from college and are living independently.
Term life is fairly straightforward, compared to permanent life, and it's less expensive than a permanent life policy. The average cost of a 20-year, $250,000 term life policy for a healthy 30-year-old is about $160 a year, roughly the cost of one latte per week, according to LIMRA and the LIFE Foundation.
A term life policy pays out if you die during the term while the coverage is in effect. Then your beneficiary collects the proceeds, called the "death benefit." You can't cash in the policy while you're still alive. With term life you risk buying something that your family might never end up using, but in return you gain the peace of mind of knowing they'd be OK if you died unexpectedly.
Permanent life insurance, such as whole life or universal life, covers you for the rest of your life. The policy pays the death benefit to your beneficiary whether you die tomorrow or in 50 years.
Permanent life insurance also includes an investment component, known as "cash value." The cash value of the policy starts off small and then gradually grows tax-free. If you hold onto the policy for many years, the cash account becomes a nest egg. You can borrow from the cash value -- the policy stays in effect as long as you repay the money, plus interest -- or surrender the policy for the cash.
Because of its cash value and lifelong coverage, permanent life insurance is pricier and more complex than term life. Some policies even provide long-term care benefits.
Which type of life insurance should you buy?
Choose term life insurance if you:

Need coverage only until a certain age (say, the age when your youngest child graduates college).
Have no dependents who will need financial help for the rest of their lives.
Don't own a family business or have a large estate to protect.
Want the most affordable type of coverage available.

Choose permanent life insurance if you:

Want to provide for lifelong dependents, such as a child with special needs.
Need to protect a large estate or family business from estate taxes.
Want to leave a legacy.
Want to provide loved ones with money for your final expenses, such as medical bills and funeral costs, no matter when you die.

How much life insurance should you buy?
Beware of easy formulas, such as multiplying your annual income by a certain number. Instead, do a thorough needs analysis. Determine how much your family would need to pay your final expenses, such as funeral costs, and how much your loved ones would need over the long haul to maintain their quality of life. Consider big expenses, such as paying off the mortgage and other debts, and funding your children's college educations.
Both parents should be insured -- not just the primary breadwinner. To determine the amount of insurance for a stay-at-home parent, consider how much it would cost to replace the services that parent provides, such as day care and other household tasks.
Don't assume your group life insurance through work will provide all the coverage you need. Most group life policies are small, and the coverage ends when your job ends. Roughly four in 10 insured married people depend solely on group life policies, according to LIMRA.
Life insurance rates
Life insurance premiums vary according to the type of policy, amount of coverage and the insurer, as well as your age and health.
That's why it's important to buy coverage sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the higher the premiums will be and the greater the risk that you could develop a health condition that will disqualify you from coverage. Besides comparing policies, evaluate insurance companies. Insure.com's Best Life Insurance Companies Tool can help you sort through leading companies based on their customers’ reviews.
Unsure about the cost of life insurance? Get a no-obligation quote
If you’re interested in learning how much life insurance will cost for you, a sensible first step is to request some quotes. This will give you a sense of how much life insurance you can afford, and which companies are likely to be your best bets for coverage.
Insure.com compiles data from numerous leading life insurance companies to help you compare quotes easily and quickly. You can start comparing quotes by filling in your information at the top of this page.  
When it comes to securing life insurance, the first steps can be among the hardest. But if you take them today, you’ll be that much closer to knowing that your loved ones will be supported in the event of your death.
And there’s really no substitute for that knowledge.
