	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE







	 







	Image Sensing Systems
	Announces 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full- Year Financials Results






	 





	Fourth quarter 2016 royalties
	remained unchanged, at $1.6 million, from the same period in the prior
	year.




	Fourth quarter 2016 product sales
	decreased approximately 36 percent from same period in the prior year.




	Since launch of Autoscope Vision,
	our North American distribution partner has reported to us that bookings
	have increased measurably compared to the same period in the prior year.






	 






	Saint Paul,
	Minn., March 23, 2017 --



	Image Sensing Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISNS) today
	announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31,
	2016.




	 





	Fourth-Quarter
	Results:





	 




	Image Sensing
	Systems’ (ISS) 2016 fourth quarter revenue from continuing operations was $2.8 million,
	compared to revenue from continuing operations of $3.5 million in the fourth
	quarter of 2015. Gross margin from continuing operations for the fourth quarter
	of 2016 was 51 percent, a 18 percentage point decrease from a gross margin of 69
	percent for the same period in 2015. The decrease in gross margin is driven by
	a $473,000 warranty charge in the fourth quarter related to a legacy product
	that is no longer sold. We have completed a detailed analysis of the warranty
	matter and have begun remediation of the issue.  Revenue from royalties was $1.6
	million in the fourth quarter of 2016, consistent with prior year period.




	 




	Product sales from continuing
	operations decreased to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 36 percent
	decrease from $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in
	product sales resulted from purchase timing in Europe and the Middle East and
	Africa (EMEA) region and an unanticipated supply chain disruption for our
	Autoscope video product sold into the EMEA region.  Autoscope video product sales and royalties were $145,000 and $1.6
	million,


	respectively, and RTMS radar product sales
	were $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Product sales gross margin
	for the fourth quarter of 2016 was negative eight percent, a 50-percentage
	point decrease from the prior year period.  The decrease in gross margin is due
	to the previously discussed individually significant warranty charge related to
	a legacy product that is no longer sold.  Furthermore, our lower product sales
	volume magnified this impact during the quarter.






	 








	 




	“Shipment of Autoscope Vision, our
	new intersection product, began in the fourth quarter and the market has
	responded enthusiastically,” said Chad Stelzig, President and CEO for ISS. 
	“The rapid acceptance of the Vision product is a testament to the level of
	detection performance, product quality, and user experience achieved by our
	talented engineering staff. Early feedback from the market and preliminary
	bookings from our partner Econolite, give us optimism that our royalty revenue
	will continue on this improved trajectory in the quarters to come.” 




	 




	“We are also happy to report that
	royalty revenue stabilized for the first time in nine quarters,” continued
	Stelzig.  “The combination of new intellectual property, stabilization of
	royalty revenue, and controlled operational costs will allow us to make key
	strategic investments in development to accelerate our growth and increase our
	product offering diversification over the upcoming year,” concluded Stelzig.




	 




	On a non-GAAP
	basis, excluding the individually significant warranty charge related to legacy
	product that is no longer sold, fourth quarter 2016 non-GAAP gross margins and
	product gross margins would have been 67 percent and 31 percent, respectively.




	 




	The Company’s
	net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $683,000
	or $0.14 per basic share, compared to a net loss from the continuing operations
	of $403,000, or $0.08 per basic share, in the prior year period. The fourth
	quarter 2016 net income from continuing operations includes operating expenses of
	$2.2 million, a $668,000 or 24 percent improvement from the fourth quarter of
	2015.  The reduction of operating expense is the result of cost saving measure
	implemented during the year, partially offset by higher R&D expense due to
	capitalized software in the comparable prior year period.




	 




	On a non-GAAP
	basis, excluding intangible asset amortization, depreciation, and restructuring
	charges for the applicable periods, operating loss from continuing operations for
	the fourth quarter of 2016 was $546,000 compared to an operating loss from
	continuing operations of $231,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 






	 









	Full-Year Results:





	 




	ISS’s revenue
	for 2016 was $14.1 million, a seven percent decrease from revenue of $15.2 million
	in 2015. Revenue from royalties was $7.7 million in 2016, compared to $8.5 million
	in 2015, a nine percent decline. Product sales decreased to $6.4 million in
	2016, a five percent decline from $6.7 million in 2015.




	 




	In 2016 revenue included
	Autoscope Video product sales and royalties of $1.1
	million and $7.7 million, respectively, and RTMS Radar product sales of
	$5.3 million. Product sales gross margin for 2016 was 37 percent, a decrease of
	11 percentage points from prior year period.  This decline is due to the
	previously discussed warranty charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2016.




	 




	On a non-GAAP
	basis, excluding the individually significant warranty charge related to legacy
	product that is no longer sold, full year 2016 non-GAAP gross margins and
	product gross margins would have been 74 percent and 45 percent, respectively.




	 




	The Company’s
	net income from continuing operations for 2016 was $687,000, or $0.14 per basic
	share, compared to a net income of $383,000, or $0.08 per basic share, in 2015.
	In 2016 net income includes operating expenses of $9.4 million, which is a $2
	million decrease from 2015.  During 2016, we capitalized $1.7 million of
	software development costs for the development of our next generation video
	detection product, the Autoscope Vision, which was available for sale starting
	in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In comparison, we capitalized $1.2 million of
	software development cost in 2015.  Our cash balance at December 31, 2016 was $1.5
	million, a decrease of $130,000 from the $1.7 million cash balance at the end of
	the third quarter of 2016.  The decrease in cash is the result of collection
	timing compared to the prior quarter.




	 




	On a non-GAAP
	basis, excluding intangible asset amortization, depreciation, and restructuring
	charges for the applicable periods, income from continuing operations for 2016
	was $1.2 million compared to a net operating income of $1.3 million in 2015.




	 





	Discontinued
	Operations: Sale of License Plate Recognition (LPR) Business Segment:





	 




	On July 9, 2015,
	ISS sold its license plate recognition (LPR) business to TagMaster A.B. for the
	purchase price of $4.2 million in cash.  As a result of this sale, results of
	the LPR business segment are classified and reported as discontinued operations
	in all periods presented. In 2015, the Company incurred a net loss of $3.5
	million from discontinued operations, including a loss on disposal of $1.1
	million, related to the LPR business segment. 




	 





	Non-GAAP
	Financial Measures:





	 




	We provide certain non-GAAP financial information as
	supplemental information to financial measures calculated and presented in
	accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting


	Principles in the United States). This non-GAAP information excludes the impact of amortizing intangible assets and depreciation and may exclude other non-recurring items.  Management believes that this presentation facilitates the comparison of our current operating results to historical operating results. Management uses this non-GAAP information to evaluate short-term and long-term operating trends in our core operations. Non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for or an alternative to GAAP financial measures and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

	Non-GAAP Income from Continuing Operations




	(in thousands)




	(unaudited)





	 



	We define Non-GAAP Income from Continuing Operations as income from continuing operations before amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and restructuring charges for the applicable periods.  Management believes Non-GAAP Income from Continuing Operations is a useful indicator of our financial performance and our ability to generate cash flows from operations.  Our definition of Non-GAAP Income from Continuing Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled definitions used by other companies. The table below reconciles on-GAAP Income from Continuing Operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to comparable GAAP financial measures:

	Note – Our calculation of Non-GAAP Income from Continuing Operations is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, “as reported”, or GAAP financial data.  However, we are providing this information, as we believe it facilitates analysis of the Company’s financial performance by investors and financial analysts.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

			management solutions for the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
