Commitment to Action 



Eco Products Fund, L.P.



Commitment by


    Equator Environmental, LLC  





In 2007, Equator and New Forest committed to establish the Eco Products Fund, a $100 million fund for investment in carbon, wetlands, and biodiversity mitigation. The fund is primarily focused on opportunities within United States, but also intends to devote a portion of the capital to international endeavors. The Eco Products Fund has committed over $20 million to forest carbon and wetlands mitigation projects. The fund is aimed at realizing value from illiquid environmental assets such as carbon, water, and biodiversity, and to use innovative financial structures to represent the value of these critical services in the marketplace.

Details

I. Equator Environmental will create a $100 million private equity fund to make investments in wetlands mitigation, endangered species conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality, and other ecosystem-based projects, and to monetize the value of such projects.  All investments will be based on land, forest or vegetation-based projects in North America.
Ecosystems provide many of the services upon which the global economy depends, such as water purification, biodiversity conservation and atmospheric climate regulation.  Globally, approximately 60% of 'ecosystem services' provided by nature are being used unsustainably or are in decline. Over the past twenty years, the amount of developed land has grown by 50% in the United States through increasing population and urbanization, creating pollution, water quality and other environmental problems.  The weight of the economy on the natural infrastructure of the U.S. has led to the pricing of ecosystems services.  Equator Environmental believes that by establishing a fund to invest in projects that preserve and enhance the viability of our ecosystems, we can have a direct impact on the preservation of our ecological assets. Equator also believes that by monetizing such assets through the creation of environmental credits and other 'eco products', we will be able to enhance the market value of our ecosystems, and create further incentives for environmental conservation.
II CGI's tremendous leadership over the past two years on environmental issues has helped inspire Equator Environmental to launch this fund, which is the first of its kind.
Measures of Success: Measures of success may include the growth of nascent markets (carbon, biodiversity, endangered species and water), creation of new financial platforms and instruments for these markets, and a rise in public awareness.
TIMELINE:
Anticipated Launch: December, 2007
First Milestone(s): Invest in at least one of each: terrestrial carbon sequestration project, wetlands mitigation project, endangered species project.
06/30/08:
Participants in this Activity: Members of Equator Environmental, LLC and New Forests Inc.


    Background  

The Eco-Products Fund will be jointly managed by Equator Environmental LLC and New Forests Inc.  Equator and New Forests bring together critical areas of expertise in underlying scientific and technical disciplines and in financial structuring, trading and commercialization of assets. In addition, the partnership creates a one stop shop with strengths in sourcing/origination, transaction management, and distribution.


    Partnership Opportunities  

SEEKING:  implementing partners, best practices information.
OFFERING:  financial resources, implementing partners, best practices information, media and marketing assistance.


Progress Reports

July 2008
The current flagship program of the commitment is the Duck's Unlimited Avoided Grassland Conversion Project in the Prairie Pothole Region.  The goal of the DU Avoided Grassland Conversion project is to protect the Prairie Pothole Region (of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana) by placing perpetual conservation easements to avoid conversion to cropping. The Project aims to protect 30,000 acres by the end of 2009.
Milestones Reached:
- Currently, over 10,000 acres have been placed under easement or are pending acceptance by the National Fish and Wildlife Service.
- To date, the National Fish and Wildlife Service has never rejected any of Equator Environmental's proposed easements.

SeaWorld Appeal Of OSHA Citations Could Impact Famous Orca Shows












AP

By Carlyn Kolker
Oct 29 (Reuters) - A killer whale, the lawyer-son of a  Supreme Court justice and the grisly death of wildlife trainer  will play roles in a U.S. appeals court case next month that  could forever change marine park operator SeaWorld's marquee  entertainment.
The signature attraction for the company's three U.S. theme  parks has been shows featuring the black-and-white killer whales  or orcas, including several named Shamu, performing flips and  other stunts under the direction of trainers who historically  have been in close contact with them.
But that changed after the February 2010 death of Dawn  Brancheau, a 40-year-old trainer. She drowned after being pulled  into a pool by Tilikum, a 12,000-pound bull orca, at SeaWorld's  site in Orlando, Florida.
In August 2010, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) fined SeaWorld $75,000 for three safety  violations, saying it had exposed its trainers to a hazardous  environment and violated a part of the Occupational Safety and  Health Act known as the general duty clause.
OSHA, a part of the Labor Department, demanded SeaWorld make  certain changes, notably, physically separating the killer whale  trainers from the orcas during show performances.
SeaWorld is appealing the broad application of a federal  safety law meant to protect workers in unusual circumstances.  The case will come before a three-judge panel of the U.S Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Nov. 12.
With animal rights activists watching, Eugene Scalia, son of  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, will represent SeaWorld in  its fight against a federal order that sharply criticized the  marine park operator's safety measures.
Ken Welsch, an administrative law judge of the Occupational  Safety and Health Review Commission, in 2012 upheld the OSHA  citations but downgraded one of them to "serious" from  "willful," effectively reducing the fine to $12,000 from  $75,000.
In appealing Welsch's decision, SeaWorld argued OSHA's fine  was premised on an overly broad view and "novel application" of  the general duty clause, which mandates that employers keep  their workplaces free from "recognized" hazards. In a 60-page  opening appellate brief, SeaWorld called the case "fundamentally  misguided."
"The clause cannot be used to force a company to change the  very product that it offers the public, and the business it is  in," SeaWorld wrote. "The clause is no more an instrument for  supervising the interactions between whales and humans at  SeaWorld, than it is a charter to prohibit blocking and tackling  in the NFL or to post speed limits on the NASCAR circuit."                
BLACKSTONE FLOATED SEAWORLD
SeaWorld Orlando is owned by SeaWorld Entertainment  , which was taken public in April by private equity firm  Blackstone Group LP. SeaWorld shares closed up 1.1  percent on Monday at $30.33 each in mildly bullish trading.
SeaWorld has brought in a high-powered team from law firm  Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to press its appeal. The team includes   Scalia, formerly the Labor Department's top lawyer. He is joined  by Baruch Fellner, also a former Labor Department lawyer, who  founded Gibson Dunn's OSHA practice.
The general duty clause is OSHA's "catch-all" clause that it  wields against companies in situations where there is not  necessarily a dominant, clearly articulated safety standard,  said Melissa Bailey, an attorney at Ogletree, Deakins, Nash,  Smoak & Stewart who represents employers in OSHA cases.
The cases can be difficult to pursue because OSHA must show  what is a "recognized" hazard when there are not clear industry  standards, she said.
"In cases like the SeaWorld case, that's a unique animal -  no pun intended," said Bailey.                
ORCAS AND PEOPLE
The penalties OSHA can bring are relatively small, but a key  issue is at stake for SeaWorld - whether its performances can  include killer whales and humans in close contact.
"OSHA penalties are not that great," said Bailey, comparing  them to fines that other agencies can levy. "But it's rarely the  fine that drives the litigation. It's often the abatement cost,  and having this on your record."
SeaWorld trainers have not been in the water with an orca  since the drowning, said SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs.
SeaWorld's primary concern in the litigation is the  long-term effect that OSHA's requirement of separation of humans  and killer whales could have on the shows. In court papers  SeaWorld called their interaction "integral to its mission."
"We want to continue to display these animals in a way that  assures their health and well-being and is safe for our  zoological staff," Jacobs said in an email. He declined to  comment further, citing the pending litigation.
Human-orca interaction has long been filled with  controversy, revisited earlier this year with the release of the  movie "Blackfish" about Brancheau's death and Tilikum's 30-year  career as an entertainer and stud for other captive whales.  SeaWorld has criticized the film as "inaccurate and misleading."                
The Labor Department says SeaWorld knew that close  human-orca contact was dangerous - Tilikum has been involved in  other human deaths - and it routinely took steps to minimize  hazards.
"The Secretary (of Labor) did not overreach in applying the  general duty clause to SeaWorld in this case because the clause  is meant to address unusual hazards for which there are no  promulgated standards, just like the hazard present here," the  Labor Department wrote in a brief.
Two animal-rights groups - People for the Ethical Treatment  of Animals and the Animal Legal Defense Fund - have weighed in  with an amicus brief to support the Labor Department. The  groups, strong critics of SeaWorld in the past, wrote in the  brief that prolonged captivity has forced the orcas to behave  aggressively.
The case is SeaWorld of Florida v. Thomas E. Perez, No.  12-1375, U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit.
For U.S. Department of Labor: M. Patricia Smith, Joseph  Woodward, Charles James, Kristen Lindberg and Amy Tryon.
For SeaWorld: Eugene Scalia, Baruch Fellner, Scott Martin  and Daniel Rathbun of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Carla Gunnin  of Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz.
