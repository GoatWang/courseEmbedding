The title of the class of equity securities to which  
this statement relates is the common stock, without par         
value (the "Shares"), of The Scotts Company, a Delaware         
corporation ("Scotts").  The address of the principal           
executive offices of Scotts is 14111 Scottslawn Road,           
Marysville, Ohio 43041.                                         

ITEM 2.  IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND. 

(a) - (c) This statement is filed by the Hagedorn     
Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the          
"Partnership") principally engaged in the holding of            
securities of Scotts.  The general partners of the              
Partnership are James Hagedorn, Katherine Hagedorn              
Littlefield, Paul Hagedorn, Peter Hagedorn, Robert Hagedorn     
and Susan Hagedorn (the "General Partners"). The business       
address of the Partnership is 800 Port Washington Boulevard,    
Port Washington, New York 11050.  Information as to the        
present principal occupation or employment and the name,        
principal business and address of any corporation or other      
organization in which such employment is conducted, of each     
General Partner is set forth on Schedule I hereto.              

 (d) During the last five years, none of the Partnership
or the General Partners has been convicted in a criminal        
proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar             
misdemeanors).                                                  

 (e) During the last five years, none of the Partnership
or the General Partners was a party to a civil proceeding of    
a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction     
and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a       
judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations     
of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to,          
federal or state securities laws or finding any violation       
with respect to such laws.                                      

(f) Each of the General Partners is a citizen of the  
United States of America.                                       

ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION. 

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement,
dated as of May 19, 1995 (the "Merger Agreement"), among        
Stern s Miracle-Gro Products Inc., a New Jersey corporation,    
Stern s Nurseries, Inc., a New York corporation, Miracle-Gro    
Lawn Products, Inc., a New York corporation, Miracle-Gro        
Products Limited, a New York corporation (collectively, the     
Miracle-Gro Constituent Companies ), the Partnership,         
Horace Hagedorn (the father of the General Partners), John      
Kenlon, Community Funds, Inc., a New York not-for-profit        
corporation (the "Charity"), Scotts and ZYX Corporation, an     
Ohio corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of       
Scotts, (i) the Miracle-Gro Constituent Companies (or, in       
the case of Stern's Nurseries, Inc., its assets) became         
wholly owned by Scotts and (ii) the Partnership, Mr.            
Hagedorn, the Charity and Mr. Kenlon were issued the shares     
of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock of Scotts (the       
"Preferred Stock") and the Charity and Mr. Kenlon were          
issued Warrants to purchase Shares (the "Warrants").  The       
Preferred Stock is convertible into Shares.                     

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION. 

The Partnership acquired the Scotts securities because
it believes that an investment in Scotts following its          
acquisition of the Miracle-Gro Constituent Companies            
represents an attractive long-term investment.  Except as       
set forth in this Schedule 13D, none of the Partnership or      
the General Partners has any plans or proposals which would     
result in any of the matters set forth in Items 4(a)-(j) of     
Schedule 13D.                                                   

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER. 

(a) The Partnership holds an aggregate of 173,472     
shares of Preferred Stock, which are convertible into           
9,130,105 Shares, and has the right to vote, and a right of     
first refusal with respect to, the Scotts securities held by    
Mr. Kenlon and his children.  In the aggregate, the             
securities listed in the foregoing sentence represent 33.5%     
of the Shares (all percentages herein are based on the          
18,677,064 Shares which Scotts reported as outstanding as of    
February 17, 1995).  The 9,130,105 Shares into which the        
Partnership's 173,472 Preferred Shares are convertible          
represent 32.8% of the Shares.                                  

The Partnership has the right to vote all Scotts'     
securities held by Mr. Kenlon and his children, and has a       
right of first refusal on such securities.  Mr. Kenlon and      
his children hold an aggregate of (i) 4,332 shares of           
Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 228,000 Shares,     
or 1.2% of the Shares, and (ii) Warrants to purchase 66,642     
Shares, or 0.4% of the Shares.  Of these securities, each of    
Mr. Kenlon's children (John D. Kenlon, Sean Kenlon, Kerian      
Kenlon and Kathleen Barry) holds Warrants to purchase 15,000    
Shares and Mr. Kenlon holds the balance.  If Mr. Kenlon and     
his children were to convert all of such Preferred Stock and    
exercise all of such Warrants, they would hold 294,642          
Shares, or 1.6% of the Shares.  As Mr. Kenlon and his           
children own securities representing less than 5% of the        
Shares, and have no agreement, arrangement or understanding     
with respect to, or other ability to control or influence,      
the voting or disposition of the Scotts securities held by      
Partnership, neither he nor any of them is not a reporting      
person hereunder.  The Partnership understands that each of     
Mr. Kenlon and his children disclaims beneficial ownership      
of the Scotts securities owned by each other.                   

(b) The Partnership has the sole power to vote all of 
the Scotts securities held by it and by Mr. Kenlon.  The        
Partnership has the sole power to dispose of the Scotts         
securities held by it, and has a right of first refusal on      
the Scotts securities held by Mr. Kenlon.  See Item 6.          

(c) Other than as set forth in Item 3, above, none of 
the Partnership or the General Partners has effected any        
transactions in the Shares in the past sixty days.              

(d) Pursuant to the agreement under which the         
Partnership was formed, the partners of the Partnership have    
certain rights to receive dividends on the Scotts securities    
received by the Partnership.  Other than such rights, no        
person is known to have the right to receive or the power to    
direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from      
the sale of, the Scotts securities.                             

(e) Not applicable.                                   

ITEM 6.  CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR             
RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER. 

Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible into a   
number of Shares equal to $1,000 divided by the conversion      
price, which is initially $19.  Each share of Preferred         
Stock is entitled to vote with the Shares and shall have a      
number of votes equal to the number of Shares into which it     
may be converted.  The Preferred Stock may be redeemed by       
Scotts at any time on or after May 31, 2000 at $1,000 per       
share plus accumulated unpaid dividends.  The Warrants will     
be exercisable for 8.5 years from issuance, 1,000,000 at $21    
per share, 1,000,000 at $25 per share and 1,000,000 at $29      
per share.  The terms of the Preferred Stock provide that if    
on any dividend payment date for such stock any portion of      
the dividends payable on such date are not paid, and at such    
time any portion of the dividend payable on the preceding       
dividend payment date remains in arrears, then, until all       
accrued and unpaid dividends are paid, the holders of the       
Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect three             
directors to the Scotts Board of Directors to fill vacancies    
newly created for such purpose.  Such three directors would     
hold office until all unpaid dividends are paid.                

  The Merger Agreement provides that the Partnership
and Mr. Kenlon (together with Horace Hagedorn and the           
Charity, the "Miracle-Gro Shareholders"), through a             
representative appointed by them (the "Shareholder              
Representative"), shall be entitled to designate three          
directors (one in each of the three classes of Scotts'          
directors) (the "Miracle-Gro Directors") to sit on Scotts'      
twelve person Board of Directors.  Horace Hagedorn, James       
Hagedorn and John Kenlon have been so designated.  Such         
persons shall take office as soon as possible consistent        
with an Agreement to Hold Separate between Scotts and the       
Federal Trade Commission. Thereafter, until the earlier of      
the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time of the              
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the          
"Standstill Period") and such time as Miracle-Gro               
Shareholders no longer beneficially own at least 19% of         
Scotts' voting stock (the "Voting Stock"), the Partnership,     
acting through the Shareholder Representative, will continue    
to be entitled to designate three of twelve members of the      
Board of Directors.  To the extent that Scotts maintains an     
Executive Committee and/or a Nominating Committee, such         
committee(s) shall consist of four members, one of which        
shall be a Miracle-Gro Director.  In addition, to the extent    
that any of the Miracle-Gro Directors is qualified, under       
the applicable requirements of the Code, the by-laws of the     
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or             
otherwise, to sit on the Audit or Compensation Committees of    
the Board of Directors or any newly created committee, one      
of such Miracle-Gro Directors shall be entitled to sit on       
such committee(s) to the same extent, and on the same basis,    
as the other members of the Board of Directors.  Following      
the Standstill Period or such time as the Miracle-Gro           
Shareholders cease to own at least 19% of the Voting Stock,     
the Miracle-Gro Shareholders will have no contractual right     
to, and the Company will not be able to restrict, the           
election of directors.                                          

    Under the Merger Agreement, until the earlier of the
end of the Standstill Period and such time as the               
Miracle-Gro Shareholders cease to own at least 19% of the       
Voting Stock, the Miracle-Gro Shareholders will be required     
to vote their shares of Preferred Stock and Shares (i) for      
Scotts's nominees to the Board of Directors, in accordance      
with the recommendation of the Board of Directors'              
Nominating Committee and (ii) on all matters to be voted on     
by holders of Voting Stock, in accordance with the              
recommendation of the Board of Directors, except with           
respect to a proposal as to which shareholder approval is       
required under the Ohio General Corporation Law (the "GCL")     
relating to (a) the acquisition of Voting Stock of Scotts,      
(b) a merger or consolidation, (c) a sale of all or             
substantially all of the assets of Scotts, (d) a                
recapitalization of Scotts or (e) an amendment to Scotts's      
Amended Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations        
which would materially adversely affect the rights of the       
Miracle-Gro Shareholders.  Scotts has agreed that, without      
the prior consent of the Partnership, expressed through the     
Shareholder Representative, it shall not (x) issue Voting       
Stock (or Voting Stock equivalents) constituting in the         
aggregate more than 12.5% of the total voting power of          
Scotts Voting Stock (the "Total Voting Power") (other than      
pursuant to employee benefit plans in the ordinary course of    
business) or (y) in a single transaction or a series of         
related transactions, make any acquisition or disposition of    
assets which would require disclosure pursuant to Item 2 of     
Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that if     
five-sixths of the Board of Directors determine that it is      
in the best interests of Scotts to make an acquisition          
pursuant to clause (y), such acquisition may be made without    
the consent of the Partnership, expressed through the           
Shareholder Representative.  In addition, during the            
Standstill Period, the Miracle-Gro Shareholders will be         
limited in their ability to enter into any  voting trust        
agreement without Scotts' consent or to solicit proxies or      
become a participant in any election contest (as such terms     
are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange    
Act) relating to the election of directors of Scotts.           
Following the Standstill Period or such time as the             
Miracle-Gro Shareholders cease to own at least 19% of the       
Voting Stock, the voting restrictions provided in the Merger    
Agreement will expire.                                          

The Merger Agreement provides that during the   
Standstill Period, the Miracle-Gro Shareholders shall not       
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of        
Voting Stock representing more than 43% of Total Voting         
Power. For purposes of calculating beneficial ownership of      
Voting Stock against the Standstill Percentage, Shares          
underlying unexercised Warrants or any subsequently granted     
employee stock options will not be included.  However, the      
terms of the Warrants provide that, if exercised during the     
Standstill Period and to the extent that such exercise would    
increase the aggregate beneficial ownership of the              
Miracle-Gro Shareholders to more than 43% of Total Voting       
Power, such exercise may only be for cash and not for           
Shares.  To the extent that a recapitalization of Scotts or     
a Share repurchase program by Scotts increases the aggregate    
beneficial ownership of the Miracle-Gro Shareholders to an      
amount in excess of 44% of Total Voting Power, the              
Miracle-Gro Shareholders will be required to divest             
themselves of sufficient shares of Voting Stock to fall         
within the 44% of Total Voting Power limit.  Scotts has         
agreed that it will use reasonable efforts to ensure that       
employee stock options are funded with Shares repurchased in    
the open market rather than newly issued Shares.                

The Miracle-Gro Shareholders have agreed in the 
Merger Agreement that, after the Standstill Period, they        
will not acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial            
ownership of Voting Stock representing more than 49% of         
Total Voting Power except pursuant to a tender offer for        
100% of Total Voting Power, which tender offer is               
conditioned upon the receipt of at least a majority of the      
Voting Stock beneficially owned by shareholders of Scotts       
other than the Miracle-Gro Shareholders and their Affiliates    
and Associates.                                                 

  During the Standstill Period, the Merger Agreement
provides that no Miracle-Gro Shareholder may transfer any       
Shares upon conversion of the Preferred Stock or exercise of    
the Warrants, except (i) to Scotts or any Person approved by    
Scotts; (ii) to a Permitted Transferee (as defined in the       
Merger Agreement) who agrees in writing to abide by the         
provisions of the Merger Agreement; (iii) pursuant to a         
merger or consolidation of Scotts or a plan of liquidation      
which has been approved by Scotts's Board of Directors; (iv)    
in a bonafide public offering registered under the              
Securities Act and designed to prevent any Person or group      
from acquiring beneficial ownership of 3% or more of Total      
Voting Power; (v) subject to Scotts's right of first offer,     
pursuant to Rule 145 or Rule 144A under the Securities Act,     
provided that such sale would not knowingly result in any       
Person or group's acquiring beneficial ownership of 3% or       
more of Total Voting Power and all such sales by the            
Miracle-Gro Shareholders within the preceding three months      
would not exceed, in the aggregate, the greatest of the         
limits set forth in Rule 144(e)(1) under the Securities Act;    
(vi) in response to a tender offer made by or on behalf of      
Scotts or with the approval of Scotts's Board of Directors;     
or (vii) subject to Scotts's right of first offer, in any       
other transfer which would not to the best knowledge of the     
transferring Miracle-Gro Shareholder result in any Person or    
group's acquiring beneficial ownership of 3% or more of         
Total Voting Power.                                             

The Merger Agreement provides that neither the  
Preferred Stock nor, during the Standstill Period, the          
Warrants may be transferred except (i) to Scotts or any         
Person or group approved by Scotts; (ii) to a Permitted         
Transferee who agrees in writing to abide by the provisions     
of the Merger Agreement; (iii) pursuant to a merger or          
consolidation of Scotts or a plan of liquidation; or (iv)       
with respect to Preferred Stock representing no more than       
15% of the Voting Stock on a fully diluted basis or any         
number of Warrants: (A) subject to Scotts's right of first      
offer, pursuant to Rule 145 or Rule 144A under the              
Securities Act, provided that such sale would not knowingly     
result in any Person or group's acquiring beneficial            
ownership of 3% or more of Total Voting Power and all such      
sales by the Miracle-Gro Shareholders within the preceding      
three months would not exceed, in the aggregate, the            
greatest of the limits set forth in Rule 144(e)(1) under the    
Securities Act; or (B) subject to Scotts's right of first       
offer, in any other transfer which would not to the best        
knowledge of the transferring Miracle-Gro Shareholder result    
in any Person or group's acquiring beneficial ownership of      
3% or more of Total Voting Power.  For purposes of clauses      
(A) and (B) only, Scotts's right of first offer with respect    
to shares of Preferred Stock would be at a price equal to       
(x) the aggregate Market Price of the Shares into which such    
shares of Preferred Stock could be converted at the time of     
the applicable Transfer Notice multiplied by (y) 105%.          

 The Merger Agreement also provides that following
the Standstill Period, the Warrants and the Shares              
underlying the Warrants and the Preferred Stock are freely      
transferable, subject to the requirements of the Securities     
Act and applicable law.                                         

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is  
qualified in its entirety by the text of the Merger             
Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit (a)    
and which is incorporated herein by reference.
