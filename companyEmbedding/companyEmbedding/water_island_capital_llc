Our Strategies
Focusing on events rather than markets, Water Island Capital takes an opportunistic and flexible approach to event-driven opportunities around the globe.

Event-driven investing is a highly specialized strategy designed to profit from the behavior of equity and debt instruments trading within the timelines of specific corporate events, such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, refinancings, recapitalizations, and distressed situations. In seeking to capture low-correlated absolute returns, Water Island Capital does not invest based on market fundamentals, but rather on event fundamentals.
When partnering with Water Island Capital, investors have access to global event-driven investing, including single-strategy and multi-strategy approaches in both fixed income and equities.


MERGER ARBITRAGE »



Seeking to profit from the successful completion of corporate reorganizations, Merger Arbitrage pursues absolute returns with low correlation. Water Island Capital’s approach may utilize both the equity and credit securities of firms involved in announced transactions, along with hedging strategies designed to minimize market exposure and volatility.





EQUITY SPECIAL SITUATIONS »



Equity Special Situations employs an event-driven investment focus around a wide range of opportunities such as spin-offs, restructurings, syndicates, and pre-arbitrage situations. We look for equity securities that we believe are significantly mispriced and offer an attractive risk/reward opportunity. At the same time, we implement hedging techniques to minimize volatility and to isolate the alpha opportunity associated with the corporate event.





CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES »



Our Credit Opportunities strategy pursues a non-traditional, catalyst-driven approach to fixed income investing. This unconstrained, alternative credit strategy focuses on a broad range of catalysts and events such as mergers, refinancings, deep value credit, and regulatory changes. We hold both long and short investments, and may employ convertible arbitrage, merger arbitrage, or capital structure arbitrage techniques in order to exploit security mispricings or inefficiencies, while seeking to limit credit and interest rate risk.





EVENT-DRIVEN »



Our Event-Driven strategy invests in opportunities where the return potential is more correlated to the outcomes of specific catalysts and events rather than to overall market direction. We implement our strategy via an optimized, blended approach to our three core investment capabilities. We adopt a flexible and cycle agnostic approach because different markets offer different opportunities.

Our Investment Discipline
Water Island Capital employs a rigorous, fundamental approach to investment analysis. We identify catalyst-driven corporate events across the capital structure that offer compelling risk/reward opportunities with an emphasis on downside protection.

The firm takes a proactive approach to risk management, striving to diversify across geography, market capitalization, sector, industry, and type of transaction, while also employing the appropriate use of options, short selling, and other hedging strategies and tools to offset event and market risk.
Investments in intellectual capital and infrastructure – including risk management systems, technology, compliance, and operations – reflect our steadfast commitment to facilitating and refining a low-risk, low-volatility methodology.



“We believe strong long-term performance is best achieved through the compounding of reasonable returns and the avoidance of major losses.”


— Gregg Loprete

Background Information:


Water Island Capital LLC »
Water Island Capital specializes in event-driven investing strategies, including strategies focused on merger arbitrage, equity special situations, and credit opportunities. These strategies are available to prospective institutional and retail clients through public mutual funds, institutional separate accounts and private funds. Water Island may use derivatives, such as options, as well as short selling or purchase of related securities and those of peer companies, to isolate the outcome of the investment in a particular “event” from the broader directional moves of the securities markets.  The Arbitrage Funds currently offer four series: The Arbitrage Fund, The Arbitrage Event-Driven Fund, The Arbitrage Tactical Equity Fund and The Arbitrage Credit Opportunities Fund.
