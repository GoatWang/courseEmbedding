Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2012-C8 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2012-C8
    





April 25, 2016 05:54 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed all 15 classes of Wells Fargo Bank, National 
      Association, WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C8 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates (WFRBS 2012-C8). A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the overall stable performance of the 
      pool's underlying collateral since issuance. As of the April 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 4.5% to $1.24 billion from $1.3 billion at issuance. Per the 
      servicer reporting, five loans (5.7% of the pool) are defeased. Interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting class H.
    

      Fitch modeled losses of 2.7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 2.5%. The pool has experienced no 
      realized losses to date. Fitch has designated three loans (4.2%) as 
      Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes one specially serviced loan 
      (0.2%). The deterministic stress scenario was used in Fitch's analysis. 
      In addition, there was a variance from criteria related to classes B, C, 
      D, and E, for which the model output suggested that an upgrade was 
      possible. Fitch determined, however, that an upgrade was not warranted 
      at this time as there have been no material changes to the performance 
      of the pool since issuance and no significant increase in credit 
      enhancement.
    

      The largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the Plaza on Richmond loan (3.5%), 
      which is secured by a 193,636 square foot (sf) retail center located in 
      Houston, TX. The subject is anchored by 24 Hour Fitness (19.08% of net 
      rentable area) through a lease that expires in October 2024. Other 
      tenants include TJ Maxx (15%, expiry January 2023), and Golf Galaxy (8%, 
      expiry May 2020). Per servicer reporting, the net operating income (NOI) 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) dropped to 1.32x as of year-end (YE) 
      2015 from 1.39x as o, as the interest-only period of the loan burned off 
      in 2014. The subject was 89% occupied as of the December 2015 rent roll.
    

      The next largest contributor to modeled losses is a loan (0.6%) secured 
      by a 96-room, extended-stay hotel located in San Angelo, TX. The subject 
      has experienced a drastic decline in occupancy due to a surplus of hotel 
      rooms available and decreased demand for lodging from oil and gas sector 
      employees, the subject's primary client base. Full-year occupancy 
      declined to 53% in 2015 from 74% in 2014. The NOI DSCR was 0.89x as of 
      December 2015. The loan has been added as a Fitch Loan of Concern and 
      will continue to be monitored for further deterioration in performance.
    

      The third largest contributor to modeled losses is a specially serviced 
      loan (0.1%) secured by a 463-unit self-storage facility located in 
      Houston, TX. The loan transferred to the special servicer in April 2015 
      due to the bankruptcy filing of a guarantor. The special servicer 
      indicates it has filed a Proof of Claim against the guarantor to which 
      the guarantor has filed an Objection. The most recent rent roll and 
      financials provided by the servicer were as of September 2014 and showed 
      the subject as 89% occupied with a year-to-date NOI DSCR of 1.65x. The 
      loan remains current, but will continue to be monitored for a resolution 
      between the guarantor and the lender.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$38.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$187.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$26 million class D at 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45.5 million class E at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22.8 million class F at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26 million class G at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional and interest-only.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class H certificates.

Part II - OTHER INFORMATION


 
Item 2. Legal Proceedings.
 
On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts.  On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice.  That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”). In December 2014, the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted.  As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs.  The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief.  Other cases (collectively, the “Additional Complaints”) alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. On March 28, 2016, the BlackRock Plaintiffs filed a new complaint in state court in San Francisco with regard to the trusts that had been dismissed in the District Court’s January 19 Order; that action was dismissed on September 28, 2016 and the court held that any claims relating to the trusts at issue must be filed in New York state court. Motions to Dismiss all of the federal actions are pending. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
 
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (“DBTCA”) and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (“DBNTC”) and have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain RMBS trusts. 
 
On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a derivative action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBNTC and DBTCA’s alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500 trusts that are governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss.  On March 22, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in federal court.  In the amended complaint, plaintiffs assert claims in connection with 62 trusts governed by Indenture Agreements.   The amended complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $9.8 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on July 15, 2016.  On August 15, 2016, plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss.  On September 2, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss.  Discovery is ongoing. 
 
On March 25, 2016, the BlackRock plaintiffs filed a state court action against DBTCA in the Superior Court of California, Orange County with respect to 513 trusts.  On May 18, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with respect to 465 trusts, and included DBNTC as an additional defendant.  The amended complaint asserts three causes of action:  breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; and breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest.  Plaintiffs purport to bring the action on behalf of themselves and all other current owners of certificates in the 465 trusts.  The amended complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $75.7 billion, but does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain.  On August 22, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty cause of action and breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest cause of action and motion to strike as to Plaintiffs’ breach of contract cause of action.  On September 12, 2016, Plaintiffs filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike of DBNTC and DBTCA.  On October 3, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA filed replies in further support of their demurrer and motion to strike.  On October 18, 2016, the court granted DBNTC and DBTCA’s demurrer, providing Plaintiffs with thirty days’ leave to amend, and denied DBNTC and DBTCA’s motion to strike.  The parties are currently permitted to promulgate discovery, subject to deadlines set forth in a case management order entered on October 17, 2016.
 
On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, “IKB”), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts.  On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of New York’s Streit Act, violation of the Trust Indenture Act, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. $268 million in damages.  On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss.
 
It is DBTCA’s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA’s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction.
 


Item 6. Significant Obligors of Pool Assets.


 


The 100 Church Street mortgage loan constitutes a significant obligor within the meaning of Item 1101(k)(2) of Regulation AB as disclosed in the Prospectus Supplement filed with the SEC on July 31, 2012. In accordance with Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB, the most recent unaudited net operating income of the significant obligor was $11,026,713.00 for the period of January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016.  
 
Item 7. Change in Sponsor Interest in the Securities.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
