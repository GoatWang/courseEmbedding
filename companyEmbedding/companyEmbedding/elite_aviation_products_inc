The goal was twofold; to create the supplier that as buyers they were always seeking to partner with, and to create the company that as employees they were always seeking to work for. Each member of the Elite Aviation Products’ team embodies the company core values; cherished characteristics that resonate throughout the organization and provide a constant source of inspiration and motivation to continually raise the bar.
