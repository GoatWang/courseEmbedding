Most often, financial security is achieved through a carefully crafted strategy to grow and preserve wealth.
This strategy cannot be mass produced or prepackaged, but rather must be designed with the unique circumstances of each client in mind. Rodgers Brothers Inc., through their broker dealer and investment advisor, offers counsel to individuals and businesses to help them to achieve financial security.
About Rodgers Brothers Inc. >
+


The accumulation, growth and transition of wealth is a lifetime process.
For many people, the day by day nurturance and maintenance of their family or their business consumes most of the available energy and resources. Yet the management of financial decisions is also crucial for the long term preservation of both families and businesses.
About Monongahela Capital Management >
+


We’ve been working for more than 25 years in the interest of wealth growth and preservation.
We provide services to individual and institutional investors who choose to entrust the management of their financial assets to professionals.

Skateboards
What is longboarding? Longboarding is the sport/hobby of riding a long skateboard.  Skateboarding evolved from surfing and became popular in the 70’s. The sport rose and fell in popularity until the mid 90’s, when it gained popularity and has been going strong ever since.  Skateboarding itself was the most popular until the mid 2000’s, when longboarding finally started to make a huge scene.
