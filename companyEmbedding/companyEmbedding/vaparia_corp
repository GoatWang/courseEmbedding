Overview



VapAria Corporation is a development stage consumer products and wellness
company focusing on the research, development, manufacturing and
commercialization of novel, in-demand, proprietary products designed to deliver
fast-acting, convenient solutions for contemporary lives and lifestyles. The
basis of our product development is proprietary, patented and patent-pending
technologies and formulas focused on three specific markets:
  The smoke-free tobacco alternative market (e-cigarettes). VapAria Corporation
   currently contemplates filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
   Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to become the first e-cigarette company
   to secure fast-track status and then seek FDA approval as a smoking cessation
   product.




  The over-the-counter (OTC) consumer market with products intended to increase
   energy and alertness, suppress appetite and aid in restful sleep; and




  The pharmaceutical market - partnering with international pharmaceutical
   companies that seek to utilize our technologies to maximize and extend the
   value and the lives of their proprietary, patented product portfolios.




Our experience and our understanding of vaporizing technology and vapor-method
medicant delivery has, to-date, resulted in our licensing one patent and
optioning two patent applications from an affiliate, Chong Corporation, which
has been assigned the patent and patent applications by two members of our
current management team, Alexander Chong and William Bartkowski, and others as
co-inventors pursuant to an Exclusive License and Option to License Agreement.
Prior to establishing our wholly-owned subsidiary VapAria Solutions in 2010, the
principals of VapAria had 28 years collective experience in vaporization and
e-cigarette technology, having been partners in a joint venture with pioneers in
the industry and having undertaken significant work internationally, researching
and developing products, shepherding them through the patent process and
introducing them into the U.S. wholesale and retail supply chain.

Exclusive License and Option to License Agreement
Effective December 31, 2013, VapAria Solutions entered into an Exclusive License
and Option to License Agreement with the Chong Corporation, a related party, for
an intellectual property portfolio including a license for the Lobelia Patent
(Patent No. 8,287,922 - Issued October 16, 2012) a method for lobelia delivery
is provided comprising: providing a lobelia solution suitable for vaporization
in a compact handheld device; providing the compact handheld device; vaporizing
the lobelia solution at a low temperature upon activation by a user such that an
effective serving of lobelia is provided to the user. This patent covers a
formulation for an FDA exempt herbal remedy that contains lobeline, an alkaloid
that produces effects similar to nicotine and caffeine, and can be
commercialized as a smoking alternative and respiratory tonic and restorative.
We believe that the benefits of commercializing this formulation include
providing a product for introduction into today's e-cigarette and vapor market
that would not be subject to taxes, similar to tobacco taxes that are now being
introduced throughout the country on e-cigarette and vapor products that contain
nicotine.
The Exclusive License and Option to License Agreement also includes an option to
license the following patent applications:
          Device Patent Application 20130199528 - A control system for a
hand-held vapor delivery device, comprising a circuit configured to provide a
precise amount of power from a power source to heat a heating element to a
minimum required temperature to completely vaporize a predetermined volume of a
liquid, and control a precise duration of time to supply the precise amount of
power to completely vaporize the predetermined volume of liquid at the required
temperature. The application also utilizes alkaline battery chemistry and an
enclosed cartridge that eliminates leaking and reduces the risks of oxidation,
contamination and adulteration- making the device suitable for pharmaceutical
applications; and
          Vaporized Medicants and Methods of Use Patent Application
20130072577- Medicant solutions, i.e. suitable for vaporization at a low
temperature: Medicants or active ingredients that are covered by the application
include energy boosters, analgesics, sleep aids, motion sickness remedies and
erectile dysfunction remedies.
Under the terms of the agreement, Chong Corporation, a related party controlled
by our Chief Executive Officer, was paid a license issue fee and option to
license fee of $196,401 in the form of 500,000 shares of VapAria Solutions' 10%
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. These shares were exchanged for shares of
our 10% Series A convertible preferred stock in the acquisition of VapAria
Solutions on July 31, 2014. and VapAria Solutions is obligated to pay a Chong
Corporation a 3% royalty commencing January 1, 2015 of no less than $50,000 per
year. The license, subject to option, is exercisable at any time during the term
of the Agreement at an option price not higher than $5 million, which may be
payable in cash, equity or note acceptable to VapAria Solutions. Subject to the
availability of sufficient capital, it is our intention to exercise this option.


[


While VapAria Solutions has historically outsourced its licensing and research
and development activities to Chong Corporation [, over time and subject to the
availability of sufficient capital it is our intention to bring those activities
under the operations of our company.
We need to raise approximately $1,500,000 in capital to provide funds for the
further development of our business,, including costs associated with research
and development and the hiring of additional personnel, and to pay our operating
expenses and obligations until such time, if ever, that we are able to generate
sufficient working capital from our operations. We do not have any firm
commitments for this additional capital and given the small size of our company,
the early stage of our operations, we may find it difficult to raise sufficient
capital to meet our needs. If we are unable to access capital as needed, our
ability to grow our company is in jeopardy and absent a significant increase in
our revenues we may be unable to continue as a going concern.



Going Concern



We incurred net losses of approximately $47,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014. The report of our independent registered public accounting
firm on VapAria Solutions' financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2013 contained an explanatory paragraph regarding its ability to continue as a
going concern based upon its recurring losses. These factors, among others,
raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our
financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There are no
assurances we will be successful in our efforts to generate consistent revenues
or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern, in which
event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.

Results of operations



We have been in the developmental stage since inception with only organizational
matters up to September 30, 2014 and we have not generated any revenues from our
operations. Through September 30, 2014, our operations mainly consisted of
closing the transaction by which we acquired VapAria Solutions in July 2014. Our
total operating expenses increased substantially for the third quarter and first
nine months of 2014 from the comparable periods in 2014 which is generally
attributable to one-time expenses associated with the acquisition.
We expect that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to develop
our business and we devote additional resources towards promoting that growth,
most notably reflected in anticipated increases in general overhead, salaries
for personnel and technical resources. However, as set forth elsewhere in this
report, our ability to continue to develop our business and achieve our
operational goals is dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional
working capital. As the availability of this capital is unknown, we are unable
to quantify at this time the expected increases in operating expenses in future
periods.
Liquidity and capital resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its
needs for cash. As of September 30, 2014 we had $6,707 in cash and cash
equivalents and a working capital deficit of $143,499, as compared to cash and
cash equivalents of $2,395 and a working capital deficit of $49,592 at December
31, 2013. Our current assets declined 44% and our current liabilities increased
144% at September 30, 2104 from December 31, 2013. Our principal sources of
operating capital have been two loans from related parties totaling $30,294 and
the issuance of a convertible note for $40,000 on July 14, 2014. The note is due
December 1, 2014 and bears interest at 10% per annum. The note is convertible in
500,000 shares of our common stock at $0.08 per share.
We do not have any commitments for capital expenditures. Our working capital is
not sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months and to
satisfy our obligations as they become due. As described earlier in this report,
we will need to raise at least $1,500,000 in additional capital during the next
12 months. As we do not have any firm commitments for all or any portion of this
necessary capital, there are no assurances we will have sufficient funds to fund
our operating expenses and continued development of our products and to satisfy
our obligations as they become due. In that event, our ability to continue as a
going concern is in jeopardy.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
We used $32,245 of cash in our operating activities during the first nine months
of 2014 compared to $36,040 used by our operating activities for the nine months
of 2013. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily
attributable to an increase in net loss (after adjusting for non-cash expenses),
partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of 2014 for a
total amount of $14,547 reflects funds repaid to VapAria from a related party,
Chong Corporation and also cash received from reverse merger, compared to net
cash used by investing activities in the first nine months of 2013 for a total
amount of $13,500 which reflects the loan to Chong Corporation.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
During the nine months of 2014 we raised $22,010 through as compared to $50,000
of loans during the first nine months of 2013.

Critical accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The
more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue
recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key
accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and
assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are
described in Note 1 to our audited financial statements for 2013 appearing in
the Post-Effective Amendment No. 4 to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 2014.
Recent accounting pronouncements
The recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or
other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date
are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon
adoption.
Off balance sheet arrangements
As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. The term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally
means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an
entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation
arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest
or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or
similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for
such assets.

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

 

This
report includes forward-looking statements that relate to future
events or our future financial performance and involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to
differ materially from any future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements. Words such as, but not limited to,
“believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “targets,”
“likely,” “aim,” “will,”
“would,” “could,” and similar expressions
or phrases identify forward-looking statements. We have based these
forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and
future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our
financial condition, results of operation, business strategy and
financial needs. Forward-looking statements include, but are not
limited to, statements about:

 




 



●



our lack
of products or revenues and the substantial risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business venture





 



 



 





 



●



our very
limited operating history and our unproven business
plan;





 



 



 





 



●



our
history of losses;





 



 



 





 



●



our
ability to continue as a going concern;





 



 



 





 



●



our
ability to raise capital to fund our business plan, pay our
operating expense and satisfy our obligations;





 



 



 





 



●



conflicts
of interest facing certain of our officers and
directors;





 



 



 





 



●



future
reliance on third party manufacturers;





 



 



 





 



●



our future
ability to comply with government regulations;





 



 



 





 



●



our lack
of experience in selling, marketing or distributing
products;





 



 



 





 



●



our future
ability to establish and maintain strategic
partnerships;





 



 



 





 



●



our
possible future dependence on licensing or collaboration
agreements;





 



 



 





 



●



the
inability of Chong Corporation to protect the intellectual property
which is licensed to us, and risks of possible third-party
infringement of intellectual property rights;





 



 



 





 



●



anti-takeover
provisions of Delaware law;





 



 



 





 



●



the
dilution impact of the issuance of shares of our common stock upon
a conversion of shares of our Series A 10% convertible preferred
stock and as payment for dividends; and





 



 



 





 



●



the impact
of penny stock rules on the future trading in our common
stock.




 

You should
read thoroughly this report and the documents that we refer to
herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be
materially different from and/or worse than what we expect. We
qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary
statements, Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our
other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. New risk
factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our
management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the
impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material
information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no
obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking
statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of
unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date of this report, and you should not rely on these
statements without also considering the risks and uncertainties
associated with these statements and our business.

VAPARIA
CORPORATION 

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER
30, 2016

 

NOTE 1
– NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

Nature of
Business

 

VapAria
Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware on December 21, 2009 under the name
OICco Acquisition IV, Inc.

 

On April
11, 2014 the Company entered into that certain Share Exchange
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Agreement”)
with VapAria Solutions, Inc., a Minnesota corporation formerly
known as VapAria Corporation (“VapAria Solutions”) and
the shareholders of VapAria Solutions (the “VapAria Solutions
Shareholders”) pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of
the outstanding capital stock of VapAria Solutions from the VapAria
Solutions Shareholders in exchange for certain shares of our
capital stock. On July 31, 2014 all conditions precedent to the
closing were satisfied, including the reconfirmation by the
investors of the prior purchase of 1,000,000 shares of our common
stock pursuant to the requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the
transaction closed.

 

At
closing, we issued the VapAria Solutions Shareholders 36,000,000
shares of our common stock and 500,000 shares of our 10% Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for the common stock and
preferred stock owned by the VapAria Solutions
Shareholders.

 

As a
result of the closing of this transaction, VapAria Solutions is now
a wholly owned subsidiary of our company and its business and
operations represent those of our company.

 

On August
19, 2014 the board of directors of the Company and the holders of a
majority of its issued and outstanding common stock approved a
Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation changing the name of our company to VapAria
Corporation. The name change was effective on August 19, 2014. Our
Board determined it was in our best interests to change our
corporate name to better reflect our business and operations
following our recent acquisition of VapAria Solutions.

 

The
Company is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the
research, design and development of methods and medicants to
address chronic conditions with novel, vapor-centric approaches to
pain management, appetite suppression, smoking cessation and
various sleep disorders.

 

The
Company has limited operations and, as of September 30, 2016, had
no employees. However, its executive officers and directors have
provided significant services to the Company without cash
compensation.

 

The
Company has a fiscal year end of December 31.

 

Basis of
presentation

 

Basis of
Presentation  -
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows as of September 30, 2016 have been
made.

 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or
omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes
thereto in the Company’s December 31, 2015 audited financial
statements appearing in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the period
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for the full year.

Reclassifications 
–
Certain reclassifications may have been made to our prior
year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to
current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
our previously reported results of operations or accumulated
deficit.

 

NOTE 2
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of
assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. Currently, the Company has limited cash and no source of
revenue sufficient to cover its operations costs and allow it to
continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of
additional capital.

 

NOTE 3
– STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY

 

In January
2016 the Company issued 25,000,000 shares of common stock to Chong
Corporation, a related entity, in exchange for five exclusive,
worldwide license agreements. We issued 5,000,000 shares for each
of the license agreements, for an aggregate issuance of 25,000,000
shares. In accordance with GAAP, the intellectual property is
carried on the VapAria balance sheet at a fair value of $100,772.
The five license agreements are as follows:

 

U.S.
Patent No.: 8,903228 issued on December 20, 2014 for a vapor

LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Chong, under the terms of a three-year
lease expiring in December 2016 at an annual rent of $9,000. We
have the right to renew the lease for an additional 12-month term
at an annual rental of $9,180 upon 60-day notice prior to the
expiration of the initial term. Rent was $2,250 for this
three-month period in both 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016,

NOTE 6
– CONVERTIBLE NOTE

 

The
Company assumed an unsecured convertible note for $40,000 that was
issued on July 14, 2014 as part of the share exchange. The note was
recently extended to mature on December 31, 2016 and continues to
bear interest at 10% per annum. The note is convertible into shares
of our common stock at $0.08 per share. The Company analyzed the
conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment
under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and
determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative
accounting. The Company therefore performed an analysis to
determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial
conversion feature and determined that the instrument does not have
a beneficial conversion feature.

 

The note
was originally due on September 1, 2014. The Company entered into a
note amendment on September 1, 2014 and the due date was extended
to December 1, 2014. On December 1, 2014, the Company extended the
note again to December 31, 2015. On December 31, 2015 the note was
again extended to July 31, 2016 and on July 31, 2016 it was
extended to December 31, 2016. The Company analyzed the
modification of the term under ASC 470-60 “Trouble Debt
Restructurings” and ASC 470-50 “Extinguishment of
Debt”. The Company determined the modification is not
substantial and the transaction should not be accounted for as an
extinguishment with the old debt written off and the new debt
initially recorded at fair value with a new effective interest
rate.

 

NOTE 7
– COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES

 

Relating
to the December 2013 Agreement with Chong Corporation, beginning in
the calendar year in which the first licensed products or licensed
services takes place, but not prior to January 1, 2015, the Company

applications and patents licensed to us. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, there were no reimbursable costs.
