Passport Services

																								





Ever since the US Government passed new laws requiring passports for all travel out of the country, passport applications have been at an all-time high. This is especially true for those travelers visiting Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Receiving a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as 4-6 weeks to process - sometimes even longer. And making use of the government's "rush" service still
provides you no guarantee of getting your passport for weeks.
Passport expediting services exist to fill this gap. By paying a service fee (which varies, according to how fast you need your passport), you can receive your new or renewed passport in as little as 24 hours. This is an invaluable service for those people who have a vacation or trip planned in the near future, and therefore can't afford to take a chance that their passport will be delayed or that they won't receive
their passport in time for their trip.

Choosing a Passport Company
Passport demand has significantly increased over the last several years, creating a back log of requests and many angry travelers.  Requesting a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as four to six, or longer, to process. If you've decided to utilize a passport company to help with your passport needs be aware that these companies vary greatly in several aspects and finding a solid company,
that you can count on, for a fair price will save you time and money.
There are a variety of qualities you should compare when evaluating passport companies. Some of these include:

Turnaround Time. Some passport companies are able to expedite your passport and have it in your hands in 48 hours or less.  While others need at least 5 to 7 days to deliver a new passport.  When looking for a passport company identify what their specific turnaround times are and what each time frame costs.  You'll see a significant differences in charges across many companies.
Website Functionality. When you're searching for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, what you can use in place of your missing birth certificate, how to obtain more passport pages, and more you'll want a company that offers a savvy website that is easy to use and loaded with information. Also, look for websites that provide online passport status information so
that
you may feel confident in the progress of your passport application.
Expert Advice. When you are looking for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, or any other challenging questions - you'll want a company that offers plenty of information either on line or via the phone. Some companies provide everything you need to know while others are short on information and big on sales pitch.
Customer Service.  Getting your needs met, reducing your panic and answering all of your complicated passport questions is what you'll want in a company that needs to produce your passport fast.  Customer service levels between passport companies can vary greatly and you'll want to choose a company where the customer is always first. Look for companies that offer several methods of communication
and have extended hours to assist you - whenever needed.

When choosing a passport company, the internet provides the best resources for investigating and locating a quality passport company that you can feel confident with.  Consider using independent product review websites to quickly locate a strong passport company. They do a good job of quickly comparing and contrasting website functionality, prices, customer service and prior performance for you.

John Burbank Shuts Down His Long-Short Hedge Fund












          by Tyler Durden

SHARES






















We almost made it a full month without a prominent hedge fund shuttering - an eternity in an age when ETFs and passive vehicles soak up several billion in capital each day at the expense of "active" managers - and then Bloomberg spoiled the streak when moments ago it reported that John Burbank, one of the handful of investors who made a killing from shorting subprime, and head of the $2.4 billion Passport Capital is shutting down one of his core hedge funds, the latest in a string of closings hitting the industry.
Passport Capital’s Long-Short Strategy Fund is winding down and will return money to investors. The fund, which had an AUM of $833 million as of December 31, and $636 million as of March 17 according to HSBC, lost 2.1% in the first two months of this year. In 2016 the Long-Short fund lost 11.8% reversing its 2015 gains, when Passport Long/Short gained 10.1%. 

A catalyst for the closure may have been a January 2017 decision by the San Bernardino employees fund to pull its funds from Passport.

Bloomberg adds that the firm’s flagship Passport Global Strategy Fund will remain open.
A recent report by Hedge Fund Research showed that more hedge funds closed in 2016 than in any year since the financial crisis. Also on Wednesday, Guard Capital told investors that it’s closing its $885 million macro hedge fund. Last month, former Goldman Sachs trader Eric Mindich said he’s winding down his $7 billion firm, Eton Park Capital Management, which was one of the biggest hedge fund startups when it launched 13 years ago. In September, Richard Perry threw in the towel on his almost three-decade-old hedge fund. 
Many more will follow, because as Goldman explained earlier this week, in a centrally-planned market, one which never falls, active returns are no nearly enough to prevent an LP exodus.

hedge funds are closing because people are pulling their money out... not due to low returns.
why are they pulling finds out... simple.. the cost of money is rising and the funds are "debt" that
needs to be serviced. Its the CARRY TRADE UNWIND.
the hedge fund industry is fuelled with  loaned capital, particularly from japan.
Hedge fund redemptions began to rise  exactly when  japanese short term rates started moving up  over a
year ago.
The fund redemptions signal that the age of cheap money is over.

So, there are a few less hedge funds. What difference does that make to the price of eggs?

                               it turns out I suck at it so here's what's left of your 
                               money back.........'

HF models do not work in deformed markets. Get close to the spigots of the CBs or suck at the teats of Govt Treausries. For that you need to be with the insiders and the Oligrachs (more so in developin economies). Otherwise, get out of the casinos and invest in your own skills and talent in the real economies. The parasatical chorus of analysts, private bankers, economisses are now entertainers that you can enoy like whores.

Passport Services

																								





Ever since the US Government passed new laws requiring passports for all travel out of the country, passport applications have been at an all-time high. This is especially true for those travelers visiting Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Receiving a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as 4-6 weeks to process - sometimes even longer. And making use of the government's "rush" service still
provides you no guarantee of getting your passport for weeks.
Passport expediting services exist to fill this gap. By paying a service fee (which varies, according to how fast you need your passport), you can receive your new or renewed passport in as little as 24 hours. This is an invaluable service for those people who have a vacation or trip planned in the near future, and therefore can't afford to take a chance that their passport will be delayed or that they won't receive
their passport in time for their trip.

Choosing a Passport Company
Passport demand has significantly increased over the last several years, creating a back log of requests and many angry travelers.  Requesting a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as four to six, or longer, to process. If you've decided to utilize a passport company to help with your passport needs be aware that these companies vary greatly in several aspects and finding a solid company,
that you can count on, for a fair price will save you time and money.
There are a variety of qualities you should compare when evaluating passport companies. Some of these include:

Turnaround Time. Some passport companies are able to expedite your passport and have it in your hands in 48 hours or less.  While others need at least 5 to 7 days to deliver a new passport.  When looking for a passport company identify what their specific turnaround times are and what each time frame costs.  You'll see a significant differences in charges across many companies.
Website Functionality. When you're searching for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, what you can use in place of your missing birth certificate, how to obtain more passport pages, and more you'll want a company that offers a savvy website that is easy to use and loaded with information. Also, look for websites that provide online passport status information so
that
you may feel confident in the progress of your passport application.
Expert Advice. When you are looking for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, or any other challenging questions - you'll want a company that offers plenty of information either on line or via the phone. Some companies provide everything you need to know while others are short on information and big on sales pitch.
Customer Service.  Getting your needs met, reducing your panic and answering all of your complicated passport questions is what you'll want in a company that needs to produce your passport fast.  Customer service levels between passport companies can vary greatly and you'll want to choose a company where the customer is always first. Look for companies that offer several methods of communication
and have extended hours to assist you - whenever needed.

When choosing a passport company, the internet provides the best resources for investigating and locating a quality passport company that you can feel confident with.  Consider using independent product review websites to quickly locate a strong passport company. They do a good job of quickly comparing and contrasting website functionality, prices, customer service and prior performance for you.

An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at www.direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
