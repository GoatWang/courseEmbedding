How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Sanders John H carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Sanders John H currently holds license 0057327 (Certified Underground Utility And Excavation Contractor), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Sanders John H



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Sanders John H



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Sanders John H



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

The mixture comprises a dispersion of the electrically conductive particles in liquid solvent which is a mixture of formic acid and a member selected from the group consisting of an amide, a carboxylic acid other than formic acid, an alcohol, an ester, a ketone, an ether, and a hydrocarbon. The process provides advantages over the prior art in permitting the use of high processing speeds, enabling easy stringup, and allowing the use of knotty and/or slubby filamentary substrates.

Blending method using a roving disintegrator-dispenser



Patent number:  4369549
                                            

Abstract:  A method and apparatus for blending a "primary staple" with a "secondary staple" wherein the weight ratio of the primary staple to the secondary staple is between 10,000:1 and 10:1 is disclosed. The secondary staple is continuously supplied to a blending machine (already working a primary staple) by drafting a textile roving. The drawn roving is then disintegrated into the secondary staple by an air flow amplifier. The air flow amplifier also supplies an air flow to transport the secondary staple to a blending machine, where it is blended into the primary staple.

Product Description▼▲
That Greek philosophy at least partially influenced Christianity is generally accepted, since it formed the foundation of the culture the first Christians lived in.  Many of the early church fathers even appropriated Greek philosophy in their attempts to evangelize the pagan world they found themselves in.  But was the Greek influence good or bad?  The question is not new; Tertullian asked, in the second century AD, "What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?  What has the Academy to do with the Church?"This book is an attempt to show that the Greek influence was, as Tertullian felt, dangerous.  Why dangerous?  Because, according to the authors, the Greek concepts of what God was like and how he interacted with humans were fatally flawed, and have resulted in a Christian theology which has pagan notions of perfection at its core.  These concepts include immutability, impassibility, and omniscience (particularly in terms of foreknowledge of all future events).The authors begin with the contention that God has granted humans a significant degree of freedom, and that He chooses to enter into a genuine relationship with them.  They defend this position biblically, historically, theologically and philosophically, offering a well-balanced, comprehensive look at several familiar issues from a different, and they claim, more biblical viewpoint. The unique interplay of the five authors in this book makes it a fascinating read.  Richard Rice makes a compelling biblical case for open theism, while John Sanders takes a look at just how Greek our Christian theology is, and why contemporary theologians are generally unwilling to accept the validity of open theism.  Clark Pinnock offers what can be termed a systematic theology of God's openness and William Hasker offers a cogent philosophical defense of open theism.  David Basinger then offers some practical implications of open theism, and compares them to the implications of both traditional classical theism and process theology.You may not agree with the authors of this volume, but the discussion itself about these major issues is vitally important.  Learn why each of these five authors came to believe in open theism, and what it means in their lives.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Voted one of Christianity Today's 1995 Books of the Year! The Openness of God presents a careful and full-orbed argument that the God known through Christ desires "responsive relationship" with his creatures. While it rejects process theology, the book asserts that such classical doctrines as God's immutability, impassibility and foreknowledge demand reconsideration. The authors insist that our understanding of God will be more consistently biblical and more true to the actual devotional lives of Christians if we profess that "God, in grace, grants humans significant freedom" and enters into relationship with a genuine "give-and-take dynamic." The Openness of God is remarkable in its comprehensiveness, drawing from the disciplines of biblical, historical, systematic and philosophical theology. Evangelical and other orthodox Christian philosophers have promoted the "relational" or "personalist" perspective on God in recent decades. Now here is the first major attempt to bring the discussion into the evangelical theological arena.

Editorial Reviews▼▲
"What nonbelievers reject is often not God, but the caricature of God that theologians have synthesized over the centuries. A faith based on that caricature is poorly suited to the hard facts of the real world. These authors masterfully retrace how that caricature was drawn, show where its distortions lie and offer a sound alternative to it."
"Almost five centuries ago, Christians thrilled at the recovery of the truth of salvation by grace that had benn hijacked from them for a millennium of church history. This book throbs today with the same excitement at the rediscovery of a God infinitely greater and freer than the cold abstractions of medievally minded reductionist theologians make him to be. The Openness of God signals a new openness of his people toward the God who has never ceased being open to them."
" The Openness of God presents a comprehensive case for a relational model of the biblical God. It is written collaboratively by a team of fine thinkers. Whether or not its arguments finally convince all, The Openness of God develops interpretations and explores insight that will enrich every careful reader."

            This is the groundbreaking book that brought Open Theism back in to vigorous discussion.  The authors rightly address some of the issues behind the issues.  Namely, how Aristotelian perfection ideals have influenced most of Western theology, especially very pervasive and influential authors such as Hodge.  Hodge, Augustine, Grudem, Piper and others present a wide sampling of those whose theology wreaks of Greek thought.The authors of this book address some of these major underlying issues that are involved in any responsible discussion of God, time, knowledge, humanity etc.  That is one of the major strengths of the book.  Not to mention of course, the Open View itself.  The Open View, as described in this book, is the most coherent, useful, realistic, and God honoring view available.  This book does not spend much time refuting any other view.  However, it does point out the inconsistencies found in Calvinism, Simple Foreknowledge, Classic Arminianism, and Molinism.  You may not adopt the view after reading this book, but it should become clear to you that it is coherent, evangelical, and biblical.  The main obstacle, in my opinion, is not the validity of this view, instead it is our willingness to cast aside ancient Western falsehoods and "open" our minds to how the rest of the world has always thought.  Also recommended: God, Time, and Knowledge by William Hasker; The God Who Risks by John Sanders; God of the Possible & Satan and the Problem of Evil by Greg Body; and for a reply to many modern critics of the Open View, Most Moved Mover by Clark Pinnock.

            This was a wonderful book!  I challenge Evangelicals to rediscover the fruit of the spirit and the Bible as the basis for discussing this view of God.  Bill Hybels advice would be good for many who disagree with the OV and then move to demonize their fellow believers: "The one clear definition of what Love is, is to treat every person as thought they were more important than you.  This means you should treat family members, friends, (open view evangelicals) employees, minorities, republicans and democrats as thought they are more important than you are."  What is missing in those who demonize others who are presenting a sincere case for a bible-based model of God is the fruit of the Spirit and the love of God.  The open view challenged me to re-read the Bible and church history without the "reformed-determinist" tradition filtering the older church and biblical traditions and text.  Made me an open view person--because it is a BIBLICAL view of God.  Good bye Aristotle!

            The authors have trespassed upon areas where they have no right to travel. God the Creator sees hears and knows every movement and every thought and what will transpire in each minute, of each hour of each day. This book if read by a majority would lose their way as far as knowing an all loving God who is guiding men through each day in the correct path. They have misrepresented God and His loving power available to all. HE knows everything.

            This book is very thought provoking.  It challenges the classical and traditional view of God and helps the reader to see God in a way that s/he may never have thought of before.  The first two chapters are long and at some points difficult (because of the controversial nature).  If your thoughts are not challenged by the evidences presented in this book maybe you should read it again.

John represents a broad range of clients in a variety of environmental settings, including regulatory compliance counseling, regulatory enforcement actions, transactions, and litigation. His experience extends across the spectrum of federal environmental laws, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund), as well as numerous state and local counterparts. John has extensive experience assisting clients in the development and implementation of compliance auditing programs and on-going compliance monitoring, the issuance of environmental permits, the defense and resolution of administrative and judicial enforcement actions, transactional due diligence and risk allocation, NEPA-related project development, and site assessment, remediation, and redevelopment. Prior to joining Troutman Sanders, John served as Chief of the Air and Toxics Branch and Chief of the Hazardous Waste Branch in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Regional Counsel in Atlanta. 
Representative Matters

As Chief of the Air & Toxics Law Branch and, subsequently, Hazardous Waste Law Branch, in the Office of Regional Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 4, was responsible for federal air quality, toxics, hazardous waste, and Superfund counseling activities, including all enforcement and permitting matters, in the eight Southeastern states under the jurisdiction of Region 4. 
Provided counsel to a commercial waste treatment facility in obtaining the first hazardous waste treatment and storage permit issued by the State of Georgia. 
Represent a Northeastern utility with respect to environmental matters, including hazardous/mixed waste and NPDES issues, associated with the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant. 
Represented a wood products company in obtaining deletion of the company’s property from a site on the Superfund National Priorities List; one of the first such “partial NPL deletions” issued by EPA. 
Have represented clients in due diligence reviews and contractual negotiations for numerous international transactions, including projects in Canada, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Indonesia, Australia, Portugal, the Czech Republic, and the Bahamas. 
Represented a major forest products company in obtaining State agency approval of a RCRA clean closure for two wood treatment facility surface impoundments which had historically received listed and characteristic hazardous waste. 
Served as counsel for a chemical manufacturer with respect to RCRA corrective action involving ethylene dichloride in soils and groundwater at a facility in Louisiana.  Negotiated a Corrective Action Plan combining bio-remediation with a risk-based closure standard. 
Represented an international chemical company in negotiations with EPA and other PRPs with respect to a former metals recovery facility listed on the NPL.  The client's alleged liability was based on its stock purchase of a company which spun off the metals recovery operations immediately prior to the purchase.  Through negotiations with EPA and litigation with other PRPs, the client's potential liability was assumed by another PRP, whom the Agency ordered to perform RD/RA at the site. 
Represented an international chemical company at a Superfund Site in Alabama, including negotiation of two RD/RA consent decrees for the groundwater and solid waste management operable units, negotiation of RI/FS activities for three operable units, negotiation with trustees on natural resource damage issues, and the filing of a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging, and obtaining through settlement, the withdrawal of EPA's designation of a 40-mile stretch of the Mobile River as an additional operable unit.  Also represented the client in obtaining a ROD amendment estimated to reduce remedial costs by $12-15 million. 
On behalf of a major wood products company, performed an air quality compliance evaluation with respect to Title V and State-enforceable only requirements for air emissions at 16 manufacturing facilities located in 10 states.  The review resulted in consultation with two State agencies, and the agencies concurred that the emissions did not violate Federal or State-enforceable only provisions of the respective facilities' Title V permits. 
Represented a State Department of Transportation, as a Special Attorney General, in a citizen suit brought by environmental groups challenging highway construction projects under the conformity provisions of Section 176 of the Clean Air Act.  The litigation was settled favorably under a consent agreement which allowed the completion of projects on which construction had commenced. 
Represented a major air carrier in a consent order negotiations with the Director of the EPA Headquarters Water Enforcement Division and staff concerning the quality of drinking water on domestic and international flights.

John H Sanders's Experience
Title: Cardiologist
               Company: Dhmc
Job Details
               DHMC's overall number of infections is 36 percent fewer than expected based on national data; DHMC was one of only four hospitals in New Hampshire with lower than expected overall infection numbers. The report measures data across six areas: overall infection rates, central line-associated bloodstream infections, central line insertion practices, surgical site infections (including coronary bypass, knee arthroplasty, and colon procedures), surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis administration, and influenza vaccination rates in hospital staff. DHMC's performance was similar to or better than the statewide average in all but one category, documentation of central line insertion practices. In that category, DHMC's adherence to four standard practices for inserting central lines in patients was slightly lower than the state average. DHMC officials attribute the percentage of adherence to the standards - an average of 90.1 percent compared to a state average of 93.5 percent - partly to a new system of documentation for the practices, taught to a large number of people who rotate in and out of critical care units. Because of DHMC's role as a teaching hospital, central line insertion standards and practices have been an area in which there are active ongoing improvement efforts, as part of a national collaborative.
