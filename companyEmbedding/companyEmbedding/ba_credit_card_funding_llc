Getting started is fast, easy, and won’t impact your credit score.





Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?
For more information on why Fast Capital 360 is the best choice for shaping your business into what you know it can be, call us today at 800-735-6107 or contact us online.

Which Business Financing Product is Best For You?
Learn about a variety of financial products geared toward small businesses.








Accounts Receivable Financing
Accounts receivable financing (A/R financing), or invoice financing, is a type of small business funding option that uses your invoices as collateral. This type of funding is for a business that needs money sooner than a client can pay them. The provider is usually a financial factoring company. The provider finances your business based on what your client owes you and you pay back the money when the client pays you.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to 80% of the Account Receivable





Funding Term
Up to 90 days



%

Interest Rate
5% to 12%





Time to Funds
Soon as one business day













Acquisition Funding
Business acquisition financing can provide you with funds to purchase a business, franchise, or asset. Your company’s assets will be used as collateral. The fees for this type of financing can be lower than other small business funding types.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
$5,000 - $5 million





Funding Term
Up to 25 years



%

Interest Rate
4.75% to 6%





Time to Funds
Anywhere from 1 to 9 months













Business Line of Credit
A business line of credit is different from other types of small business funding options. Most of the time, business have a specific need for new capital. For instance, short term funding is usually used to address a sudden expenditure. Long-term funding tends to be used for long-term investments. A business line of credit is different because it’s acquired before there’s an actual need for funding. The line of credit can be drawn from when funds are needed, but doesn’t require you to pay interest when you are not using it.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $1M





Funding Term
Up to 20 years



%

Interest Rate
7% to 25%





Time to Funds
Anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks













Commercial Real Estate Financing
Before a provider decides whether or not to approve you for secured financing, they will often look at your proposed collateral and determine how much it is worth. In these situations, the more valuable the collateral, the better chance you’ll be approved for funding. With commercial real estate financing, you offer your commercial real estate as collateral for your funding.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $5M





Funding Term
Up to 25 years



%

Interest Rate
4.25% to 6%





Time to Funds
Anywhere from 30 to 60 days













Equipment Financing
Equipment financing is small business funding designed to supply you with money for new equipment, like electronics, vehicles, machinery, or whatever specific type of equipment you use in your industry. This type of financing can only be used for equipment purchases because the new equipment will be used as collateral for the funding. That means if you default on the funding, you lose the equipment along with whatever you’ve paid toward the fees so far.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $5M





Funding Term
Up to 6 years



%

Interest Rate
7.5% to 45%





Time to Funds
As soon as 2 business days













Franchise Funding
Purchasing a franchise can be a good way to own a business without starting a business. Existing franchises are usually already branded. So as a franchise owner, it won’t be your job to promote a new business. Instead, you will promote a new location for an already successful business. Before that, though, you will need to buy the franchise. Franchise funding can provide you with the funds to make that happen.

Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $5M





Funding Term
Up to 25 years



%

Interest Rate
2.25% to 2.75%





Time to Funds
Depending on the program, as little as 2 days













Merchant Cash Advance
With a merchant cash advance, you are borrowing against your future earnings. Most of the time, this means that you’ll pay back the funding with a portion (usually around 10-percent to 20-percent) of every credit card sale you make. Unlike other funding types, the fees for a merchant cash advance (sometimes referred to as an MCA) are determined with a “Interest Rate.” This Interest Rate is usually around 1.14 to 1.48.

Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $200,000





Funding Term
Usually around 9 months



%

Factor Rate
1.14 to 1.48





Time to Funds
As soon as 1 business day













Microloan
Technically, a microloan is part of the SBA Microloans Program, which helps small businesses get relatively small loans. Unlike many other types of providers, microlenders are usually non-profit companies and work in specific communities. The time it takes to get funded through a microloan can be longer than other small loan options, but the interest rate is usually much lower. If you have the time to wait for a microloan, it’s definitely a viable option for a small loan, especially when you don’t qualify for a traditional bank loan.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $50,000





Funding Term
Up to 6 years



%

Interest Rate
8% to 13%





Time to Funds
As soon as 2 months













SBA Loan
The federal government created the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help support small businesses. One way the agency supports small businesses is through SBA loans. SBA loans aren’t actually offered by the SBA. Instead, the SBA offers loan guarantees to financial institutions that issue SBA loans. There are a variety of SBA loan products, including the SBA 504, SBA 7(a), and the SBA Express.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $5M





Funding Term
Up to 25 years



%

Interest Rate
6% to 13%





Time to Funds
As soon as 30 days













Short Term Business Funding
When you’re making a long-term investment, you can use traditional-term business funding. For unexpected, short-term expenses, short-term funding can be a better option. Short-term business funding works best with businesses that have a solid financial history but need to manage a sudden cash flow gap.
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $250,000





Funding Term
Up to 5 years



%

Interest Rate
8% to 60%





Time to Funds
As soon as 7 days













Startup Funding
Here’s a way a lot of businesses owners run into trouble: They try to get funding only to discover that their business does not have a long enough financial history to secure funding. Businesses in this situation would be better served by small business startup funding, which usually doesn’t require the two-year financial history record that other funding types require. 
learn more








Maximum Funding Amount
Up to $750,000





Funding Term
Up to 5 years



%

Interest Rate
8% to 17%





Time to Funds
As soon as 2 weeks













Traditional-Term Business Funding
Many people think traditional-term business funding is the only type of small business funding out there. That’s not true, but this type of funding does work for a lot of different business types. It’s for companies that want to borrow a specific amount of money at a set rate and pay it back over a fixed term. If everything goes according to plan, this type of funding shouldn’t offer any surprises. That makes it ideal for well-grounded companies with a solid financial outlook.

Maximum Funding Amount

Frequently Asked Questions
If you have questions during the funding request process, please do not hesitate to contact us.
                    We are here to help. You can also find answers to frequently asked questions below.











                            How does Lendza pair me with a funding provider?
                        



                            After you fill out our form, we try to pair you with a provider. Our top priority is to find you a reputable provider.
                        





                            What are the small business funding requirements?
                        



                            There are many different types of small business funding options, each with unique requirements. There are, however, standard (though not inclusive) requirements you should be aware of:
                            
Be a U.S. citizen.
Be at least 18 years of age.
Have an address, phone number, and email address.







                            Does the Lendza form encrypt my information to keep it secure?
                        



                            Yes. We use 256-bit encryption to keep your data as safe as possible.
                        





                            Does Lendza require a hard credit pull?
                        



                            No. We transfer your information on to the provider without checking your credit. The provider will need to check your credit before providing you with funding, though.
                        





                            How high does my personal credit need to be to get small business funding?
                        



                            There are many types of small business funding options. Some require a high personal credit score as well as a high business credit score, but others do not. Some of the SBA loans are especially for small businesses that wouldn’t be able to get traditional funding because of their personal or business credit score. We do our best to pair you with a provider that can work with your credit score.
                        





                            How long will it take to get my funds?
                        



                            There are many different kinds of small business financing options. The “time to funding” varies by type, partially because of how extensive the background check is. In some cases you could have your money in two days. Other funding types can take as long as nine months. Your provider will let you know how long you should expect to wait for your funding.
                        





                            Is Lendza a funding provider?
                        



                            No. We are not a small business funding provider. Instead, we have direct relationships with providers. Our job is to help you find a funding provider for your business.

Advertising Practices
We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.

This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.
If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.

Getting started is fast, easy, and won’t impact your credit score.





Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?
For more information on why Fast Capital 360 is the best choice for shaping your business into what you know it can be, call us today at 800-735-6107 or contact us online.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
