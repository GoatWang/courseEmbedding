Resource Real Estate Investors 7, L.P. Earns an Average Annual Return 
      of 17.7 Percent on Successful Property Sale




-Sale resulted in a profit of $3.8 million-






March 25, 2015 04:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time



PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Resource Real Estate Investors 7, L.P. (the “Fund”), a private limited 
      partnership sponsored by Resource 
      Real Estate, Inc. (“Resource Real Estate” or “RRE”), today announces 
      the successful sale of Woodland Hills Apartments.
    

      The Fund acquired Woodland Hills, a 228-unit multifamily residential 
      community located in Atlanta, Georgia, in December 2008. The property 
      benefited from RRE’s proven management expertise and capital improvement 
      program. RRE implemented a significant renovation to the property to 
      upgrade unit interiors, common spaces, and the overall appeal of the 
      asset to attract higher paying residents. Once the property’s 
      performance was optimized, it generated significant interest from 
      potential buyers, and its recent sale produced a cash profit of $3.8 
      million and an average annual return of 17.7 percent over seven years.
    

      Alan Feldman, CEO of Resource Real Estate, said, “Woodland Hills 
      represents a strong execution of RRE’s proven methodology of acquiring 
      undervalued apartments in need of new capital and improved management, 
      putting that capital and management to optimal use, and executing a 
      successful sale as a result. This asset was strategically acquired and 
      expertly managed by RRE’s experienced team of real estate professionals 
      and has resulted in an impressive outcome for our investors.”

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

NOTE 1
– NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

 

 Resource
Real Estate Investors 7, L.P. (“R-7” or the
“Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership which
owns and operates or invests in multifamily residential properties
located in Georgia, Maine and Texas (referred to as the
“Properties”).  The Partnership also may
invest in interests in real estate mortgages and other debt
instruments that are secured, directly or indirectly, by
multifamily residential rental properties although the Partnership
has no such investments as of June 30, 2011.  R-7 was
formed on March 28, 2008 and commenced operations on June 16,
2008.  The General Partner, Resource Capital Partners,
Inc. (“RCP” or the “GP”), is in the
business of sponsoring and managing real estate investment limited
partnerships and tenant in common programs.  RCP
contributed $1,000 in cash as its minimum capital contribution to
the Partnership.  In addition, RCP holds a 5.53% limited
partnership interest in the Partnership at both June 30, 2011 and
December 31, 2010.  RCP is an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. (“RAI”), a
publicly traded company (NASDAQ: REXI) operating in the real
estate, financial fund management and commercial finance
sectors.

 

 The
Partnership will continue until March 28, 2016, unless terminated
earlier in accordance with the First Amended and Restated Agreement
of Limited Partnership (the
“Agreement”).  The GP has the right to extend
the Partnership term for one or more periods to a maximum of two
years in the aggregate following the initial termination
date.

 

 The
Agreement provides that income is allocated as follows: first, to
the Limited Partners (“LPs”) and the GP (collectively,
the “Partners”) in proportion to and to the extent of
the deficit balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts;
second, to the Partners in proportion to the allocations of
Distributable Cash (as defined in the Agreement); and third, 100%
to the LPs.  All losses are allocated as follows: first,
100% to the LPs until the LPs have been allocated losses equal to
the excess, if any, of their aggregate capital account balances
over the aggregate Adjusted Capital Contributions (as defined in
the Agreement); second, to the Partners in proportion to and to the
extent of their respective remaining positive capital account
balances, if any; and third, 100% to the LPs.

 

 Distributable
cash from operations, payable monthly, as determined by the GP, is
first allocated 100% to the LPs until all partners have received
the Priority Return (as defined in the Agreement); thereafter, 80%
to the LPs and 20% to the GP.

 

 Distributable
cash from capital transactions, as determined by the GP, is first
allocated 100% to the LPs until the LPs have received their
Priority Return; second, 100% to the LPs until their Adjusted
Capital Contributions have been reduced to zero; and thereafter,
80% to the LPs and 20% to the GP.

 

 The
consolidated financial statements and the information and tables
contained in the notes thereto as of June 30, 2011 are
unaudited.  Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  However, in the
opinion of management, these interim financial statements include
all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the
interim periods presented.  The unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the
Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2010.  The results of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2011 may not necessarily be
indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending
December 31, 2011.

Principles
of Consolidation

 

 The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries, as
follows:

 




Subsidiaries



 



Number of
Units



 



Location





RRE
Tamarlane Holdings, LLC, or Tamarlane Apartments

Decatur,
GA





 



 



809



 



 




 

 All
material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

 The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The
Partnership estimates the allowance for uncollectible receivables
and adjusts the balance quarterly.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

 

Supplemental
Disclosure of Cash Flow Information

 

 During
the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Partnership paid,
$1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in cash for
interest.

 

Advertising

 

 The
Partnership expenses advertising costs as they are
incurred.  Advertising expenses totaled $52,000 and
$87,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

 

Deferred
Financing Costs

 

 Costs
incurred to obtain financing have been capitalized and are being
amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective
yield method.

 

Income
Taxes

 

 Income
taxes or credits resulting from earnings or losses are payable by
or accrue to the benefit of the Partners; accordingly, no provision
has been made for income taxes in these consolidated financial
statements.

 

 The
Partnership evaluates the benefits of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in its tax returns under a two-step
recognition and measurement process.  Only the largest
amount of benefits from the tax positions that will more likely
than not be sustainable upon examination are recognized by the
Partnership.  The Partnership does not have any
unrecognized tax benefits, nor interest and penalties, recorded in
the consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of
operations and does not anticipate significant adjustments to the
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve
months.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS –

JUNE 30,
2011

(unaudited)

 

 

NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES –
(Continued)

 

Income
Taxes - (Continued)

 

 The
Partnership is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) and by the taxing authorities in those
states in which the Partnership has significant business
operations.  The Partnership is not currently undergoing
any examinations by taxing authorities.  The Partnership
may be subject to U.S. Federal income tax and state/local income
tax examinations for the years 2008 through 2010.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

 Revenue
is primarily derived from the rental of residential housing units
with lease agreement terms of approximately twelve
months.  The Partnership recognizes revenue in the period
that rent is earned, which is on a monthly basis.  Rents
are recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease for leases with varying rental payments.  Any
incentives included in the lease are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease.

 

 The
future minimum rental payments to be received from noncancelable
operating leases are approximately $3.9 million and $5,000 for the
twelve months ending June 30, 2012 and 2013, respectively, and none
thereafter.

 

Long-Lived
Assets

 

 The
Partnership reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If it is
determined that an asset’s estimated future cash flows will
not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount, an impairment
charge will be recorded to reduce the carrying amount for that
asset to its estimated fair value.  There was no recorded
impairment loss for the period ended June 30, 2011.

 

Rental
Properties

 

 Rental
properties are carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation.  Buildings and improvements and personal
property are depreciated for financial reporting purposes on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives.  The value of in place leases is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining term of each
respective in place lease acquired.  For income tax
reporting purposes, the Partnership uses the Modified Accelerated
Cost Recovery System.  Useful lives used for calculating
depreciation for financial reporting purposes are as
follows:

 




 



Buildings
and improvements



 



 5 -
27.5 years



 





 



Personal
property



 



 3 -
15 years



 




 

Tenant
Receivables

 

 Tenant
receivables are stated in the financial statements at amounts due
from tenants net of an allowance for uncollectible
receivables.  Payment terms vary and receivables
outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past
due.  The Partnership determines its allowance by
considering a number of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, security deposits held, the
Partnership’s previous loss history, the tenants’
current ability to pay their obligations to the Partnership, the
condition of the general economy and the industry as
whole.  The Partnership charges off receivables when they
become uncollectible.  At June 30, 2011 and December 31,
2010, there was $0 and $248, respectively, in the allowance for
uncollectible receivables.

 

Redemptions

 

 The
LPs may request redemption of their units at any
time.  The Partnership has no obligation to redeem any
units and will do so only at the GP’s
discretion.  If the Partnership redeems units, the
redemption price is generally the initial investment less all
distributions from the Fund to the LP, and less all organization
and offering expenses charged to the LP.

 

Reclassification

 

 Bad
debt expense was reclassified from general and administrative
expense to rental operating expense in the 2010 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 2011
presentation.

NOTE 4
– DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS

 

 Deferred
financing costs include unamortized costs incurred to obtain
financing which are being amortized over the term of the related
debt.  Accumulated amortization as of June 30, 2011 and
December 31, 2010 was approximately $474,000 and $387,000,
respectively.  Estimated amortization expense of the
existing deferred financing costs of the Partnership’s

 The
mortgage notes payable are with recourse only to the Properties
securing them subject to certain limited standard exceptions, as
defined in the mortgage notes, which the General Partner has
guaranteed by executing a guarantee with respect to each
property.  These exceptions are referred to as
“carveouts”.  In general, carveouts relate to
damages suffered by the lender for a subsidiary’s failure to
pay rents, insurance or condemnation proceeds to lender, to pay
water, sewer and other public assessments or charges, to pay
environmental compliance costs or to deliver books and records, in
each case as required in the loan documents.  The
exceptions also require the General Partner to guarantee payment of
audit costs, lender’s enforcement of its rights under the
loan documents and payment of the loan if the subsidiary
voluntarily files for bankruptcy or seeks reorganization, or if a
related party of the subsidiary does so with respect to the
subsidiary.

NOTE 8 -
INSURANCE CLAIM

 

On April
4, 2011, a windstorm damaged one unit at Woodland
Hills.  The Property was insured for the
damage.  The Property reduced the carrying value of
buildings and improvements by $54,000, and established a receivable
for the expected net insurance proceeds of $12,000 (of which $9,000
has already been received).  Accordingly, the estimated
loss of $42,000 was charged to casualty loss.

  

NOTE 9
– SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Company has evaluated subsequent events and determined that no
events have occurred which would require an adjustment to the
