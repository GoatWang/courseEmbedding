Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We estimate that the net proceeds from our sale of 5,250,000 shares of our
common stock in this offering will be $48.3 million, based on the public 
offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be $55.6 million.

We currently anticipate that we will use approximately $38.0 million of the net
proceeds received by us to support ongoing sales and marketing activities for
V-Go and to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure. We anticipate we will
use approximately $10.0 million of the net proceeds received by us to fund
research, development and engineering activities and manufacturing capabilities,
which we expect to include the further development of our V-Go Prefill and V-Go
Link products, although we expect that we will need to seek additional capital
to complete their development and commercialization. We expect that the
remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including the amount of cash generated by our
operations, our cash needs, the rate of adoption of our products by the medical
community and efficiency of our product development. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors. We therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds
to be used for the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or 
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described 
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and 
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government.


The medical technology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by
rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on
proprietary products. Competition in the diabetes market is particularly 
intense, due largely to the fact that products designed to treat diabetes
currently compete with both traditional and new products. We compete with these
products based on efficacy, price, reimbursement, ease of use and healthcare
provider education.

Within the diabetes market, V-Go is cleared by the FDA for adult patients who
require insulin, with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, although we position
V-Go to compete primarily in the market for adult patients with Type 2 diabetes
requiring insulin, particularly as part of a basal-bolus insulin regimen. Our
primary competitors in the basal-bolus insulin therapy market are manufacturers
of insulin and insulin pens, such as Novo Nordisk, Sanofi S.A. and Eli Lilly and
Company.

In addition to basal-bolus insulin therapy, glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1,
analog injection products are another potential competitor to V-Go. GLP-1 analog
injection products are used in combination with OADs or basal insulin injection.
Some physicians, when faced with a patient who is unable to reach or maintain
glucose levels at his or her goal with OADs, will add a GLP-1 through
twice-daily, once-daily or once-weekly injections. As a result, we also compete
with pharmaceutical manufacturers of GLP-1 analog injection products, such as
AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and GlaxoSmithKline plc. In addition, we may compete
with inhaled insulin products for bolus therapy, which have been recently
introduced to the market.

In the area of basal-bolus device competition, we do not consider programmable
insulin pumps to be products that compete directly with V-Go, as those products,
although cleared for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, have been primarily
designed and marketed for patients with Type 1 diabetes. We believe that the
simple and discreet design and interface of V-Go more directly addresses the
needs of patients with Type 2 diabetes. Patients with Type 2 diabetes, for
example, are often taking many drugs for multiple diseases, including 
medications to treat high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, and, as a
result, they desire a simple to use and discreet method to deliver their
insulin. We are not aware of any other single-use disposable, mechanical (which
means the device does not include any electronics, batteries or audible alarms
and does not require any recharging or programming), basal-bolus insulin
delivery devices currently marketed or in development at this time.


Company Description
We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on improving health
and simplifying life for people with diabetes by developing and commercializing
innovative technologies. We designed our first commercialized product, the
V-GoWearable Insulin Delivery Device, or V-Go, to help patients


 with Type 2
diabetes who require insulin to achieve and maintain their target blood glucose
goals. V-Go is indicated for continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin over 24
hours and on-demand bolus dosing in two-unit increments in adult patients
requiring insulin. V-Go is a small, discreet and easy-to-use disposable insulin
delivery device that a patient adheres to his or her skin. V-Go is not
considered durable medical equipment because it is not intended for repeated
use. Each V-Go device is designed to be worn for 24 hours, removed from the body
and disposed. V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the body’s normal
physiologic pattern of insulin delivery throughout the day and to manage their
diabetes with insulin without the need to plan a daily routine around multiple
daily injections.

We currently focus on the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes—a pervasive
and costly disease that, according to the 2014 National Diabetes Statistics
Report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the
CDC, currently affects 90% to 95% of the approximately 21 million U.S. adults
diagnosed with diabetes. The CDC estimated that the combined direct medical and
drug costs and indirect lost productivity costs of diabetes in the United States
was approximately $245 billion in 2012. We believe the majority of the 
12.6 million U.S. adults treating their Type 2 diabetes with more than one daily
oral anti-diabetic drug, or OAD, or an injectable diabetes medicine can benefit
from the innovative approach of V-Go to manage Type 2 diabetes. Our near-term
target market consists of the approximately 5.6 million of these patients who
currently take injectable insulin, of which up to 4.5 million may not be
achieving their target blood glucose goal.

Insulin therapies using syringes, pens and programmable insulin pumps are often
burdensome to a Type 2 diabetes patient’s daily routine, which can lead to poor
adherence to prescribed insulin regimens and, as a result, ineffective diabetes
management. We developed V-Go utilizing our core technology, the
h-Patchplatform, as a patient-focused solution to address the challenges of
traditional insulin therapies. Our h-Patch platform facilitates the simple and
effective subcutaneous delivery of injectable medicines to patients across a
broad range of therapeutic areas. V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the
body’s normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery by releasing a single type
of insulin at a continuous preset background, or basal, rate over a 24-hour
period and on-demand, or bolus, dosing around mealtime. We believe V-Go is an
attractive management tool for patients with Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin
because it only requires a single fill of insulin prior to use and provides
comprehensive basal-bolus therapy without the burden and inconvenience
associated with multiple daily injections. V-Go is available in three different
dosages depending on the patient’s needs and is generally cost competitive for
both patients and third-party payors when compared to insulin pens or
programmable insulin pumps.

V-Go was one of the first insulin delivery devices cleared by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, or FDA, under its Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative,
which established additional device manufacturing requirements designed to
foster the development of safer, more effective infusion pumps, and is the only
FDA-cleared mechanical basal-bolus insulin delivery device in the United States.
All other FDA-cleared basal-bolus insulin delivery products currently available
in the United States are electronic and are classified as “durable medical
equipment” and, although cleared for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, were
designed primarily for patients with Type 1 diabetes. V-Go is a mechanical
device, and it does not include any electronics, batteries or audible alarms and
does not require any recharging or programming, which allows for simple and
discreet use. Unlike electronic insulin delivery devices, V-Go is not classified
as durable medical equipment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
or CMS, allowing for potential Medicare reimbursement under Medicare Part D. The
Medicare Part D outpatient drug benefit defines V-Go and certain other supplies
used for injecting insulin as “drugs,” which allows V-Go to be available for
coverage by Part D Plans under Medicare Part D. In addition to Medicare, a
majority of commercially insured patients are currently covered for V-Go under
their insurance plans.

We commenced commercial sales of V-Go in the United States during 2012. During
the first half of 2012, we initiated an Early Access Program to provide a
limited number of physicians with free V-Go products for patients and began
shipments to major wholesalers in anticipation of commercial launch. In the
second half of 2012, we began hiring sales representatives in selected U.S.
markets. At the end of 2015, our sales team consisted of 63 sales 
representatives covering 63 territories primarily in the East, South, Midwest
and Southwest regions of the United States. In February 2016, we underwent a
reduction-in-force to focus our resources on prioritized higher-volume
territories and we currently have 36 sales representatives in 37 territories.
Generally speaking, each sales professional covers one prioritized territory.

When we refer to our financial results in this prospectus for periods prior to
the 2016 Merger discussed below, we are referring to the financial results of
Valeritas, Inc., the accounting acquirer in the 2016 Merger. Our net losses were
$46.4 million and $67.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was
$424.2 million and $377.9 million, respectively. Since launching V-Go, the total
number of prescriptions for, and the number of patients using, V-Go have
increased each quarter. Based on prescription data, we estimate that there were
approximately 89,600 prescriptions reported for V-Go filled during the year
ended December 31, 2016. Refill prescriptions account for nearly two-thirds of
our total prescriptions, and generally move in parallel with our patient
retention rates, so can be used as a proxy to determine patient retention rates.
We estimate that as of December 31, 2016, over 10 million V-Go’s had been
dispensed to patients and used for over 10 million cumulative patient days.

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 3, 2016 in connection with
the 2016 Merger discussed below. Valeritas, Inc., referred to as Valeritas, was
incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 26, 2008. On May 3, 2016, our
wholly owned subsidiary, Valeritas Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in
the State of Delaware on May 3, 2016, or Acquisition Sub, merged with and into
Valeritas. Pursuant to this transaction, referred to as the 2016 Merger,
Valeritas was the surviving corporation and became our wholly owned subsidiary.
All of the outstanding stock of Valeritas was either cancelled or converted into
shares of our common stock. Prior to the 2016 Merger, we were Cleaner Yoga Mat,
Inc., a corporation formed in the State of Florida and we were previously
engaged in the sale of sanitizing solutions for Yoga and Pilates studios as well
as conventional gyms of all sizes.

In connection with the 2016 Merger and pursuant to the terms of a Split-Off
Agreement and a General Release Agreement, we transferred our pre-2016 Merger
assets and liabilities to our pre-2016 Merger majority stockholder, Leisa
Swanson, in exchange for the surrender by her and cancellation of 5,060,750
shares of our common stock, referred to as the Split-Off.

As a result of the 2016 Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-2016
Merger business and acquired the business of Valeritas and going forward will
continue the existing business operations of Valeritas as a publicly traded
company. Following the 2016 Merger and Split-Off, the shareholders of Valeritas
effectively control the combined companies, and, accordingly, Valeritas is
deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the 2016 Merger.

Our principal executive offices are located at 750 Route 202 South, Suite 600,
Bridgewater, NJ 08807. Our telephone number is +1-908-927-9920. Our website

BRIDGEWATER, N.J., March  13, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Valeritas Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:VLRX) today announced that effective at 9:00 a.m., EDT, on March 15, 2017, the Company will effect an eight-for-one reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock.  The authority to implement a reverse stock split was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on March 8, 2017, and the Company’s Board of Directors subsequently adopted the reverse stock split.  Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every eight shares of issued and outstanding common stock as of the close of business on March 14, 2017 will be combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, with no change in par value per share. The Company's common stock will open for trading on the OTCQB on March 15, 2017 on a post-split basis. 
The reverse stock split is primarily intended to bring the Company into compliance with the minimum average closing share price requirement for its potential up-listing onto the Nasdaq Capital Market.    The Company's common stock will continue to trade under the symbol "VLRX" but will have a new CUSIP number (91914N 202). The reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock from approximately 13.1 million shares to approximately 1.6 million shares. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares that would result from the reverse stock split will be settled in cash. Shareholders holding share certificates will receive information from West Coast Stock Transfer, the Company's transfer agent, regarding the process for exchanging their shares of common stock.   Shareholders with questions may contact our transfer agent at West Coast Stock Transfer by calling 619.664.4780. Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in the Company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2017, a copy of which is available at www.sec.gov.
