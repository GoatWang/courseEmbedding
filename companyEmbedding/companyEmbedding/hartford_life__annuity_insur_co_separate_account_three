(1) These expenses are annualized. The Fund began operations on June 17, 1999.

(2) The Fund's Class 2 distribution plan or "Rule 12b-1 Plan" is described in
the Fund's prospectus. While the maximum amount payable under the Fund's
Class 2 Rule 12b-1 Plan is 0.35% per year of the Fund's average daily net
assets, the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance
Products Trust has set the current rate at 0.25% per year through at least
April 30, 2001.

(3) The fund administration fee is paid indirectly through the management fee.

(4) On 2/8/00, a merger and reorganization was approved that combined the
Franklin Small Cap Fund with a similar fund of the Templeton Variable
Products Series Fund, effective 5/1/00. On 2/8/00, fund shareholders
approved new management fees, which apply to the combined fund effective
5/1/00. The table shows restated total expenses based on the new fees and
assets of the fund as of 12/31/99, and not the assets of the combined fund.
However, if the table reflected both the new fees and the combined assets,
the fund's expenses after 5/1/00 would be estimated as: Management Fees
0.55%, Distribution and Service Fees 0.25%, Other Expenses 0.27%, and Total
Fund Operating Expenses 1.07%.





(5) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 0.75% of average net assets for
the current fiscal year. After December 31, 2001, the manager and
administrator may end this arrangement at any time. Without this reduction
Total Fund Operating Expenses were:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(6) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 1.30% of average net assets,
including Class 2's 12b-1 plan fee, for the current fiscal year. After
December 31, 2001, the manager and administrator may end this arrangement at
any time.


(7) Each Series has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the series'
custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the series with
its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each series may enter into
other such arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements, which would
also have the effect of reducing the series' expenses. After these
reductions, the Total Fund Operating Expenses would be:

(8) MFS has contractually agreed, subject to reimbursement, to bear expenses for
these series such that each such series' "Other Expenses" (after taking into
account the expense offset arrangement described above), do not exceed 0.15%
of the average daily net assets of the series during the current fiscal
year. These contractual fee arrangements will continue until at least
May 1, 2001, unless changed with the consent of the board of trustees which

Item 26. Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control with the Depositor or
Registrant



Filed herewith as Exhibit 16.



Item 27. Number of Contract Owners




As of July 31, 2000, there were 10,733 Contract Owners.




Item 28. Indemnification



Sections 33-770 to 33-778, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes ("CGS") provide that a corporation may provide indemnification
of or advance expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent.
Reference is hereby made to Section 33-771(e) of CGS regarding
indemnification of directors and Section 33-776(d) of CGS regarding
indemnification of officers, employees and agents of Connecticut
corporations. These statutes provide, in general, that Connecticut
corporations incorporated prior to January 1, 1997 shall, except to the
extent that their certificate of incorporation expressly provides
otherwise, indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents
against "liability" (defined as the obligation to pay a judgment,
settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with
respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses incurred
with respect to a proceeding) when (1) a determination is made pursuant
to Section 33-775 that the party seeking indemnification has met the
standard of conduct set forth in Section 33-771 or (2) a court has
determined that indemnification is appropriate pursuant to Section
33-774. Under Section 33-775, the determination of and the
authorization for indemnification are made (a) by the disinterested
directors, as defined in Section 33-770(3); (b) by special counsel; (c)
by the shareholders; or (d) in the case of indemnification of an
officer, agent or employee of the corporation, by the general counsel
of the corporation or such other officer(s) as the board of directors
may specify. Also, Section 33-772 provides that a corporation shall
indemnify an individual who was wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection
with a proceeding to which he was a party because he was a director of
the corporation. In the case of a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation or with respect to conduct for which the director, officer,
agent or employee was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a
financial benefit to which he was not entitled, indemnification is
limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
proceeding against the corporation to which the individual was named a
party.


Under the Depositor's bylaws, the Depositor must indemnify both
directors and officers of the Depositor for (1) any claims and
liabilities to which they become subject by reason of being or having
been directors or officers of the Depositor and (2) legal and other
expenses incurred in defending against such claims, in each case, to
the extent such is consistent with statutory provisions.





Section 33-777 of CGS specifically authorizes a corporation to procure
indemnification insurance on behalf of an individual who was a
director, officer, employer or agent of the corporation. Consistent
with the statute, the directors and officers of the Depositor and
Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered
under a directors and officers liability insurance policy issued to The
Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

be kept by Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
rules thereunder, are maintained by Hartford at 200 Hopmeadow

Item 31. Management Services

FUND PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT



THIS AGREEMENT, made as of this ___ day of ____________, 2000 by and
among Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Hartford"); a Connecticut corporation,
on its behalf and on behalf of each separate account set forth on SCHEDULE A
attached as it may be amended from time to time (the "Separate Accounts");
___________________ (the "Fund"); ___________________ (the "Distributor"); and
___________________ (the "Adviser").


WHEREAS, the Fund engages in business as an open-end management
investment company and is available to act as the investment vehicle for
separate accounts established by insurance companies for life insurance policies
and annuity contracts; and


WHEREAS, the Distributor is registered as a broker/dealer under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), is a member in
good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
"NASD") and serves as principal underwriter of the shares of the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and any applicable state securities
laws and serves as the investment adviser to the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Fund intends to make available shares of its series set
forth on SCHEDULE B, as it may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement
of the parties (the "Series"), to the Separate Accounts of Hartford; and


WHEREAS, Hartford is an insurance company which has registered or will
register the variable annuities and/or variable life insurance policies listed
in Schedule A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), unless exempt from such
registration, to be issued by Hartford for distribution (the "Contracts"); and


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises, Hartford,
the Fund, the Distributor and the Adviser agree as follows:



ARTICLE I. FUND SHARES



1.1     The Fund and the Distributor agree to make shares of the Series
available for purchase on each Business Day by the Separate Accounts. The Fund
will execute orders placed for each Separate Account on a daily basis at the
net asset value of each Series next computed after receipt by the Fund or its
designee of such order.


3





A.     For purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the designee
of the Fund and Distributor for receipt of orders from each Separate Account
and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that the Fund
receives notice of orders by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the next following
Business Day.


B.     For purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the
Fund calculates the net asset value of each Series pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as set forth in the Series'
prospectus.


1.2    The Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board"), acting in good faith
and in the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, may refuse to permit the
Fund to sell shares of any Series to any person, or suspend or terminate the
offering of shares of any Series if such action is required by law or by
regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the sale of shares.


1.3    The Fund and the Distributor agree that shares of the Fund or any of its
Series will be sold only to insurance companies for use in conjunction with
variable life insurance policies or variable annuities. No shares of the Fund
or any of its Series will be sold to the general public.


1.4    The Fund and the Distributor agree to redeem for cash, at Hartford's
request, any full or fractional shares of the Series held by the Separate
Accounts, on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt
by the Fund or its designee of the request for redemption.


A.     For the purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the
designee of the Fund for receipt of redemption requests from each Separate
Account and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that
the Distributor receives notice of the redemption request by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern
time) on the next following Business Day.


1.5    Hartford agrees that purchases and redemptions of Series shares offered
by the then current prospectus of the Series shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of the prospectus.


A.     Hartford will place separate orders to purchase or redeem
shares of each Series. Each order shall describe the net amount of shares and
dollar amount of each Series to be purchase or redeemed.


B.     In the event of net purchases, Hartford will pay for shares
before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next Business Day after receipt of an
order to purchase shares.


C.     In the event of net redemptions, the Fund shall pay the
redemption proceeds in federal funds transmitted by wire before 3:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the next Business Day after an order to redeem Fund shares is
made.


4





1.6    Issuance and transfer of the Series' shares will be by book entry only.
Share certificates will not be issued to Hartford or any Separate Account.
Shares purchased will be recorded in an appropriate title for each Separate
Account or the appropriate sub-account of each Separate Account. The Fund shall
furnish to Hartford the CUSIP number assigned to each Series identified in
Schedule B attached as may be amended from time to time.


1.7    The Distributor shall notify Hartford in advance of any dividends or
capital gain distributions payable on the Series' shares, but by no later than
same day notice by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time (by wire or telephone, followed by
written confirmation). Hartford elects to reinvest all such dividends and
capital gain distributions in additional shares of that Series. The Fund shall
notify Hartford of the number of shares issued as payment of dividends and
distributions. Hartford reserves the right to revoke this election and to
receive all such dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.


1.8    The Distributor shall make the net asset value per share of each Series
available to Hartford on a daily basis as soon as reasonably practical after
the net asset value per share is calculated. The Fund shall use its best
efforts to make such net asset value per share available by 6:00 p.m. Eastern
time.


A.     If the Distributor provides materially incorrect share net
asset value information through no fault of Hartford, the Separate Accounts
shall be entitled to an adjustment with respect to the Series shares purchased
or redeemed to reflect the correct net asset value per share.


B.     The determination of the materiality of any net asset value
pricing error and its correction shall be based on the SEC's recommended
guidelines regarding these errors. Any material error in the calculation or
reporting of net asset value per share, dividend or capital gain information
shall be reported promptly to Hartford upon discovery. The Fund and/or its
agents shall indemnify and hold harmless Hartford against any amount Hartford
is legally required to pay qualified plans ("Plans") or annuity or life
insurance contract owners that have selected a Series as an investment option
("Contract owners"), and which amount is due to the Fund's or its agents'
material miscalculation and/or incorrect reporting of the daily net asset
value, dividend rate or capital gains distribution rate. Hartford shall submit
an invoice to the Fund or its agents for such losses incurred as a result of
the above which shall be payable within sixty (60) days of receipt. Should a
material miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to Hartford,
Hartford shall immediately reimburse the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents for any material losses incurred by the Fund, the applicable Series or
its agents as a result of the incorrect calculation. Should a material
miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to the Plans or
Contract owners, Hartford will consult with the Fund or its designee as to what
reasonable efforts shall be made to recover the money and repay the Fund, the
applicable Series or its agents. Hartford shall then make such reasonable
effort, at the expense of the Fund or its


5





agents, to recover the money and repay the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents; but Hartford shall not be obligated to take legal action against the
Plans or Contract owners.


With respect to the material errors or omissions described above, this section
shall control over other indemnification provisions in this Agreement.

Section or regulations. In the event a Series ceases to so qualify, the Fund
will notify Hartford immediately of such event and the Adviser will take all
steps necessary to adequately diversify the Series so as to achieve compliance
within the grace period afforded by Treasury Regulation Sections 1.817-5.



ARTICLE VI. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS



6.1    The Board of Directors of the Fund will monitor the Series for the
existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the
Contract owners of all separate accounts investing in the Series. The Board of
Directors of the Fund shall promptly inform Hartford if it determines that an
irreconcilable material conflict exists and the implications thereof.


9





6.2    Hartford will report any potential or existing material irreconcilable
conflict of which it is aware to the Board of Directors of the Fund. This
includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by Hartford to inform the Board
of Directors of the Fund whenever Contract owner voting instructions are
disregarded.


6.3    If it is determined by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund,
or a majority of its independent Directors, that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists due to issues relating to the Contracts, Hartford will, at its
expense and to the extent reasonably practicable, take whatever steps it can
which are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material
conflict, including, without limitation, withdrawal of the affected Separate
Account's investment in the Series. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a
result of such withdrawal.


6.4    Hartford, at the request of the Adviser will, at least annually, submit
to the Board of Directors of the Fund such reports, materials or data as the
Board may reasonably request so that the Board may fully carry out the
obligations imposed upon them. All reports received by the Board of potential
or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to determining the
existence of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately
remedies a conflict, shall be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or
other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made
available to the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request.



ARTICLE VII. INDEMNIFICATION



7.1    Indemnification by Hartford


A.     Hartford agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor,
the Adviser, the Fund and each of their directors (if applicable), officers,
employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Fund within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"
and individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.1)
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts
paid in settlement with the written consent of Hartford, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including the reasonable costs of
investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in connection therewith)
(collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified Parties may become subject
under any statute or regulation, or at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of Series shares or the Contracts
and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in a disclosure
document for the Contracts or in the Contracts themselves or in sales
literature generated or approved by Hartford applicable to the Contracts or
Separate Accounts (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing)
(collectively, "Company Documents" for the purposes of this Article VII), or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or the


10





alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, provided that this
indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified Party if such statement or
omission or such alleged statement or omission was made in reliance upon and
was accurately derived from written information furnished to Hartford by or on
behalf of the Fund for use in Company Documents or otherwise for use in
connection with the sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Fund Documents as defined in Section 7.2 (A)(1)) or
wrongful conduct of Hartford or persons under its control, with respect to the
sale or acquisition of the Contracts or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Fund Documents as
defined in Section 7.2(A)(1) or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and accurately derived from written information furnished to the
Fund by or on behalf of Hartford; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by Hartford to
provide the services or furnish the materials required under the terms of this
Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by Hartford in this Agreement or arise out
of or result from any other material breach of this Agreement by Hartford; as
limited by and in accordance with, Sections 7.1(B) and 7.1(C) hereof.


B.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any Losses which are due to an Indemnified Party's
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such
Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party's reckless
disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement or to the Fund or
Distributor, whichever is applicable.


C.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any claim made against an Indemnified Party unless
such Indemnified Party shall have notified Hartford in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify Hartford of any
such claim shall not relieve Hartford from any liability which it may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, Hartford shall be entitled to participate, at
its own expense, in the


11





defense of such action. Hartford also shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action. After
notice from Hartford to such party of Hartford's election to assume the defense
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any
additional counsel retained by it, and Hartford will not be liable to such
party under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties will promptly notify Hartford of the
commencement of any litigation or proceedings against them or any of their
officers or directors in connection with the issuance or sale of the Series
shares or the Contracts or the operation of the Fund.


7.2    Indemnification by the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund


A.     The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund agree to indemnify and
hold harmless Hartford and each of its directors, officers, employees and

Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties" and
individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.2) against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement with the written consent of the Distributor, the Adviser, and the
Fund, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including
the reasonable costs of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in
connection therewith) (collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified
Parties may become subject under any statute or regulation, or at common law or
otherwise, insofar as such Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of the
Series' shares or the Contracts and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration
statement, prospectus or sales literature of the Fund applicable to the Series
(or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing) (collectively, "Fund
Documents" for purposes of Article this VII) or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, provided that this indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified
Party if such statement or omission of such alleged statement or omission was
made in reliance upon and was accurately derived from written information
furnished to the Fund, the Adviser, or the Distributor by or on behalf of
Hartford for use in Fund Documents or otherwise for use in connection with the
sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Company


12





Documents) or wrongful conduct of the Fund, Adviser or Distributor or persons
under their control, with respect to the sale or distribution of the Contracts
or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Company Documents, or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if
such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and accurately derived
from written information furnished to Hartford by or on behalf of the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund to provide the services or furnish the
materials required under the terms of this Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the
Fund in this Agreement or arise out of or result from any other material breach
of this Agreement by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; as limited by,
and in accordance with, Sections 7.2(B) and 7.2(C) hereof.


B.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any Losses which are due
to an Indemnified Party's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of such Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such
Indemnified Party's reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this
Agreement or to Hartford or the Separate Account, whichever is applicable.


C.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any claim made against an
Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund, as applicable, in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund of any such claim shall not relieve the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund from any liability which they may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund
shall be entitled to participate, at their own expense, in the defense thereof.
The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund also shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.
After notice from the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund to such party of
their election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear
the expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the Distributor, the
Adviser, and the Fund will not be liable to such party under this Agreement for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred


13





by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Distributor,
the Adviser, and the Fund of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings
against them or any of their officers or directors in connection with the
issuance or sale of the Contracts or the operation of a Separate Account.


7.3    Any party seeking indemnification (the "Potential Indemnitee") will
promptly notify any party from whom they intend to seek indemnification (each a
"Potential Indemnitor") of all demands made and/or actions commenced against
the Potential Indemnitee which may require a Potential Indemnitor to provide
such indemnification. At its option and expense, a Potential Indemnitor may
retain counsel and control any litigation for which it may be responsible to
indemnify a Potential Indemnitee under this Agreement.


7.4    With respect to any claim, the parties each shall give the others
reasonable access during normal business hours to its books, records, and
employees and those books, records, and employees within its control pertaining
to such claim, and shall otherwise cooperate with one and other in the defense
of any claim. Regardless of which party defends a particular claim, the
defending party shall give the other parties written notice of any significant
development in the case as soon as practicable, and such other parties, at all
times, shall have the right to intervene in the defense of the case.


7.5    If a party is defending a claim and indemnifying another party hereto,
and: (i) a settlement proposal is made by the claimant, or (ii) the defending
party desires to present a settlement proposal to the claimant, then the
defending party promptly shall notify the Indemnified Party of such settlement
proposal together with its counsel's recommendation. If the defending party
desires to enter into the settlement and the Indemnified Party fails to consent
within five (5) business days (unless such period is extended, in writing, by
mutual agreement of the parties hereto), then the Indemnified Party, from the
time it fails to consent forward, shall defend the claim and shall indemnify
the defending party for all costs associated with the claim which are in excess
of the proposed settlement amount.


Regardless of which party is defending the claim: (i) if a settlement requires
an admission of liability by the non-defending party or would require the
non-defending party to either take action (other than purely ministerial
action) or refrain from taking action (due to an injunction or otherwise) (a
"Specific Performance Settlement"), the defending party may agree to such
settlement only after obtaining the express, written consent of the
non-defending party. If a non-defending party fails to consent to a Specific
Performance Settlement, the consequences described in the last sentence of the
first paragraph of this Section 7.5 shall NOT apply.


14





7.6    The parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute
concerning this indemnification obligation. Should those efforts fail to
resolve the dispute, the ultimate resolution shall be determined in a DE NOVO
proceeding, separate and apart from the underlying matter complained of, before
a court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may initiate such proceedings
with a court of competent jurisdiction at any time following the termination of
the efforts by such parties to resolve the dispute (termination of such efforts
shall be deemed to have occurred thirty (30) days from the commencement of the
same unless such time period is extended by the written agreement of the
parties). The prevailing party in such a proceeding shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.



ARTICLE VIII. APPLICABLE LAW



8.1    This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted
under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut.


8.2    This Agreement, its terms and definitions, shall be subject to the

9.1    This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the first
to occur of:


A.     Termination by any party for any reason upon six-months advance
written notice delivered to the other parties; or


B.     Termination by Hartford by written notice to the Fund, the
Adviser or the Distributor with respect to any Series in the event any of the
Series' shares are not registered, issued or sold in accordance with applicable
state and/or federal law, or such law precludes the use of such shares as the
underlying investment medium of the Contracts issued or to be issued by
Hartford; or,


C.     Termination by Hartford upon written notice to the Fund with
respect to any Series in the event that such Series ceases to qualify as a
Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code or under any
successor or similar provision; or


D.     Termination by Hartford upon written notice to the Fund and the
Distributor with respect to any Series in the event that such Fund fails to
meet the diversification requirements specified in Section 5.1 of this
Agreement.


E.     Termination upon mutual written agreement of the parties to
this Agreement.


15





9.2    Effect of Termination.


A.     Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Fund
shall, at the option of Hartford, continue to make available additional shares
of the Series pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for all
Contracts in effect on the effective date of termination of this Agreement (the
"Existing Contracts") unless such further sale of Series shares is proscribed
by law, regulation or applicable regulatory body. Specifically, without
limitation, the owners of the Existing Contracts will be permitted to direct
allocation and reallocation of investments in the Fund, redeem investments in
the Series and invest in the Series through additional purchase payments.


B.     Hartford agrees not to redeem Series shares attributable to the
Contracts except (i) as necessary to implement Contract owner initiated or
approved transactions, or (ii) as required by state and/or federal laws or
regulations or judicial or other legal precedent of general application or

(iii) as permitted by an order of the SEC. Upon request, Hartford will promptly
furnish to the Fund the opinion of counsel for Hartford to the effect that any
redemption pursuant to clause (ii) above is a legally required redemption.


C.     In addition to the foregoing, Article VII Indemnification shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

RE:    HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY SEPARATE ACCOUNT SEVEN
FILE NO. 333-76423



Dear Sir/Madam:


I have acted as General Counsel to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company
(the "Company"), a Connecticut insurance company, and Separate Account Seven
(the "Account") in Connecticut with the registration of an indefinite amount of
securities in the form of variable annuity contracts (the "Contracts") with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
I have examined such documents (including the Form N-4 registration statement)
and reviewed such questions of law as I considered necessary and appropriate,
and on the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:


1.     The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing as a
stock life insurance company under the laws of the State of Connecticut
and is duly authorized by the Insurance Department of the State of
Connecticut to issue the Contracts.


2.     The Account is a duly authorized and existing separate account
established pursuant to the provisions of Section 38a-433 of the
Connecticut Statutes.


3.     To the extent so provided under the Contracts, that portion of the assets
of the Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with
respect to the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising
out of any other business that the Company may conduct.


4.     The Contracts, when issued as contemplated by the Form N-4 Registration
Statement, will constitute legal, validly issued and binding obligations
of the Company.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form N-4
registration statement for the Contracts and the Account.


Sincerely yours,






/s/ Lynda Godkin

Applicants' Representations
1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company originally incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts on June 5, 1902, and subsequently re-domiciled to Connecticut. Hartford life is engaged in the business of writing individual and group life insurance and annuity contracts in the District of Columbia and all states. Hartford Life is a subsidiary of Hartford Fire Insurance Company. Hartford Life is ultimately controlled by The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. For purposes of the Act, Hartford Life is the depositor and sponsor of the HL Account Three, as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts. 
2. Hartford Life and Annuity is a stock life insurance company originally incorporated under the laws of Wisconsin on January 9, 1956, and subsequently redomiciled to Connecticut. Hartford Life and Annuity is engaged in the business of writing individual and group life insurance and annuity contracts in Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all states but New York. Hartford Life and Annuity is a subsidiary of Hartford Fire Insurance Company. Hartford Life and Annuity is ultimately controlled by The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. For purposes of the Act, Hartford Life and Annuity is the depositor and sponsor of the HLA Account Three, as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts. 
3. Hartford Life established the HL Account Three on June 22, 1994, and Hartford Life and Annuity established the HLA Account Three on June 22, 1994, as segregated investment accounts under Connecticut law. Under Connecticut law, the assets of the HL Account Three attributable to the Contracts, through which interests in HL Account Three are issued, are owned by Hartford Life, but are held separately from all other assets of Hartford Life for the benefit of the owners of, and the persons entitled to payment under, Contracts. Similarly, the assets of the HLA Account Three attributable to the Contracts, through which interests in the HLA Account Three are issued, are owned by Hartford Life and Annuity, but are held separately from all other assets of Hartford Life and Annuity for the benefit of the owners of, and the persons entitled to payment under, those Contracts. Consequently, such assets in each Separate Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business that Hartford Life and Hartford Life and Annuity may conduct. Income, gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from the assets of each of these Separate Accounts are credited to or charged against that Separate Account without regard to the income, gains or loses arising out of any other business that Hartford Life and Hartford Life and Annuity may conduct. Each Separate Account is a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) under the Act, and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust. 
4. The assets of the HL Account Three support variable annuity Contracts, and interests in the HL Account Three offered through such Contracts have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) on Form N-4. The assets of the HLA Account Three support variable annuity Contracts, and interests in the HLA Account Three offered through such Contracts have been registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-4. 
5. HSD is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. HSD is the principal underwriter for the Contracts and for other Hartford variable insurance products. HSD is an affiliate Start Printed Page 54552of Hartford Life and Hartford Life and Annuity.
6. The Contracts are flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts. The annuity Contract provide for the accumulation of values on variable basis, fixed basis, or both, during the accumulation period, and provide settlement or annuity payment options on a variable basis, fixed basis, or both.
7. At the end of the accumulation period, the Contract owner elects whether to receive a “lumb sum” payment of the Contract's accumulated value, or to receive that value under one of several other payment options that Hartford offers. While some of these payment options provide payments for a period that includes the life of an “annuitant,” others do not.
8. The Contracts incorporate many other features, including several “death benefit” options, partial and full surrender rights, transfer privileges, and other optional rider benefits.
9. In addition to any charges associated with the underlying mutual funds, the charges under the Contracts are as follows:

A Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (“CDSC”) may be assessed against each premium payment withdrawn or surrendered from a contract. The length of time from receipt of the premium payment to the time of withdrawal or surrender determines the amount of the CDSC. During the first seven Contract years, withdrawals or surrenders are deemed to be withdrawn first from premiums paid, in the order in which such premiums were received, and then from earnings. After the seventh Contract year, all withdrawals or surrenders are deemed to be withdrawn first from earnings, then from premium payments in the order in which such premiums were received. The CDSC is applied to premiums withdrawn in the percentage shown in the following table:

Length of time (in years) from premium paymentSurrender  charge  
               (percent)162635455463728 or more0

Each Contract year, an amount equal to a specific percentage of total premium payments paid as of the date of the withdrawal (“Annual Withdrawal Amount”) may be withdrawn without being subject to any otherwise applicable CDSC. The Annual Withdrawal Amount under a Contract is currently 10%.
An annual contract maintenance charge of $30 is assessed on each Contract anniversary date or, when applicable, the date on which the Contract is fully surrendered. This fee will be waived if the Contract's account value exceeds $50,000 on the Contract's anniversary date.
An administrative charge is assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of 0.15% of the Contract's account value invested in the Separate Accounts.
A mortality and expense risk charge is assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of 1.25% of the Contract's account value invested in the Separate Accounts.
An optional Death Benefit Rider is available for an additional charge assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of 0.15% of the Contract's account value invested in the Separate Accounts.
A charge corresponding to any applicable state premium taxes.

10. Hartford now proposes to offer a Longevity Reward Rider (the “LRR”) to owners of certain existing Contracts. The additional benefits under the LRR include:

A reduced mortality and expense risk charge assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of 1.15% of a Contract's account value invested in the Separate Accounts; and
A new CDC schedule with a lower maximum percentage (5%) and of shorter duration (5 years), applies to the withdrawal or surrender of any premium payments made after the LRR is added to the Contract.

11. After the LRR is added to a Contract (“Rider Date”), a new five-year CDSC schedule (“New Schedule”) applies to all withdrawals or surrenders made after the Rider Date and supplants the original CDSC schedules for the Contacts. Under the New Schedule, withdrawals or surrenders made during the first five years from the Rider Date are taken first from premiums paid, in the order such premiums were received, and then from earnings. After the fifth year from the Rider Date, all withdrawals or surrenders are taken first from earnings, then from premium payments, in the order such payments were received.
12. The New Schedule applies to all premium payments withdrawn or surrendered, whether made before or after the Rider Date, as shown in the following table. For premium payments made after the Rider Date, the five-year period runs from the date of that premium payments. For premium payments made before the Rider Date, the five-year period runs from the Rider Date.
Length of time (in years) from premium paymentSurrender  charge  
               (percent)152433425160
13. The same exceptions that apply to the Contract's basic CDSC will also apply to the New Schedule. Specifically, no CDSC will be imposed: (a) At the time an Annuity Payment Option commences; (b) upon the death of a Contract owner or annuitant; (c) upon amounts withdrawn to satisfy any applicable minimum distribution requirements under the Internal Revenue Code; or (d) for amounts withdrawn which are within the limits of the Annual Withdrawal Amount. The Annual Withdrawal Amount is currently 10%.
14. If withdrawn or surrendered after the Rider Date, premium payments made before the Rider Date are subject to a CDSC for an additional five years, even if they were no longer subject to a CDSC under the Contracts. For example, if the LRR were purchased in the eighth Contract year, the initial premium would no longer be subject to a CDSC under the Contract. However, upon purchase of the LRR, the initial premium becomes subject to a CDSC for five years after the Rider Date. Moreover, until withdrawals or surrenders are taken first from “earnings” and then from premiums (i.e.,  five years after the Rider Date) more of the amount withdrawn or surrendered may be subject to a CDSC that would be the case under Contracts without the LRR because the surrender is deemed to be withdrawn first from premiums and then from earnings.
15. Except for the New Schedule, the LRR will not result in any increase in or imposition of any charge. Except for the potential application of the New Schedule to premium made before the Rider Date to which no CDSC would apply under the Contracts absent the LRR, every aspect of a Contract will be at least as favorable after the LRR is added as it was before.
16. Further, adding the LRR to a Contract will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract owners.
17. The  LRR will only be available to Contract owners who: (a) Have maintained their Contracts for at least seven years, and either (b) have not Start Printed Page 54553made any premium payments within the previous two years or (c) have a CDSC less than or equal to two percent of current Contract value. For those Contract owners electing the LRR who made premium payments prior to the Rider Date,  that remain subject to a CDSC on the Rider Date, that charge will be waived and the New Schedule will apply. Contract owners will not be permitted to elect for the LRR to apply to part of a Contract and not to the rest. Any election of the LRR must apply to the whole Contract.
18. After an initial notification of the offer in prospectuses for the Contracts or other communication to Contract owners, the LRR will be offered by providing eligible owners who express an interest in learning the details of the offer, in addition to such prospectus, a separate document explaining the offer (“the Offering Document”).
19. The Offering Document will advise Contract owners that the offer is specifically designed for those Contract owners who intend to continue to hold their Contracts as long-term investment vehicles. The Offering Document will state that the offer is not intended for all Contract owners, and that it is not appropriate for any Contract owner who anticipates surrendering all or a significant part of his or her Contract within the next five years. The Offering Document will encourage Contract owners to carefully evaluate their personal financial situation when deciding whether to accept or reject the offer of the LRR. In addition, the Offering Document will explain that the New Schedule will not apply to amounts withdrawn in a Contract year that do not exceed the Annual Withdrawal Amount, or to premium payments maintained until expiration of the New Schedule. In this regard, the Offering Document will state in plain English that, if a significant amount of the Contract's value is surrendered or withdrawn during the five years following the Rider Date, (a) the LRR's benefits may be more than offset by the New Schedule; and (b) a Contract owner may be worse off than if he or she had rejected the offer.
20. To accept the LRR, an owner must complete an election form. This election form will include the disclosure set forth in Condition No. 1 under “Conditions” below.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 11(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any registered open-end company, or any principal underwriter for such a company, to make or cause to be made an offer to the holder of a security of such company, or of any other open-end investment company, to exchange that security for a security in the same or another such company on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the respective securities, unless the terms of the offer have first been submitted to and approved by the Commission.
2. Section 11(c) of the Act, in pertinent part, effectively requires that any offer of exchange of the securities of a registered unit investment trust for the securities of any other investment company be approved by the Commission, regardless of the basis of the exchange.
3. Congress enacted Section 11 to prevent “switching” (i.e., “the practice of inducing security holders of one investment company to exchange their securities for those of a different investment company) ‘solely for the purpose of exacting additional selling charges.’ ” According to the Commission, “[I]nvestors in ‘fixed trusts,’ now known as unit investment trusts, were found to be particularly vulnerable to switching operations. In order to earn another sales commission, a UIT sponsor would often pressure unit holders into exchanging their units for those of another of the sponsor's trusts.”
4. Applicants assert that the LRR would not involve “switching.” Rather, the purpose of the LRR, as with other optional riders, is to enable Contract owners to enhance their Contracts without having to purchase a new variable annuity contract. In addition, because the LRR offers benefits to Contract owners, as described above, Applicants believe it cannot fairly be argued that the LRR's sole purpose is to exact additional selling charges (or any other type of charge).
5. Further, applicants assert that election of the LRR will not result in any duplicative charges and that the limited CDSC provided under the LRR is reasonable in relation to the benefits that the rider provides and the costs that Applicants will incur in providing those benefits. Applicants represent that those costs will include costs of developing and administering the LRR, the direct dollar costs of the charges that will be waived or reduced, the benefits that will be paid under the LRR, and the costs of distributing the LRR to Contract owners and educating them about it.
6. Applicants note that the New Schedule imposes a lower maximum CDSC and is shorter in duration than the schedules under the Contracts without the LRR. If the Contract owner makes no surrenders during the five years after the Rider Date, there is no possibility that a CDSC will be deducted that exceeds what would have been deducted absent the LRR. Moreover, even if premium payments are withdrawn during that five-year period, the New Schedule will apply only if the amount withdrawn exceeds the Annual Withdrawal Amount.
7. Applicants argue that the LRR will be offered only to Contract owners who already have demonstrated an ability to maintain their Contracts for substantial periods of time. The income taxes that are generally payable when earnings are withdrawn from a Contract, as well as the potential tax penalties that may apply to withdrawals made prior to an owner reaching age 591/2, serve as additional motivations that encourage most owners to hold their Contracts for a substantial number of years. Any CDSC will be waived with respect to any amounts necessary to meet the minimum distribution requirements applicable to the Contract under federal tax law.
8. Applicants assert that, given the conditions described above, few Contract owners who add the LRR to their Contracts will ever be assessed any additional CDSC. 
9. Applicants state that the primary benefit of the LRR is the .010% reduction in mortality and expense risk charge to Contract owners, which benefit is guaranteed and cannot be reduced or withdrawn.
10. Further, Applicants state that additional premium payments made after the LRR is added to a Contract will be subject only to the 5%/5-year New Schedule rather than the Contract's regular 6%/7-year CDSC schedule that would have applied to those same premium payments under the Contracts if the LRR had not been added to the Contract. Applicants assert that this is a substantial benefit to any Contract owner—including a surviving spouse of the Contract owner who is eligible to continue the Contract after the Contract owner's death—who may have an interest in making further premium payments.
11. In light of these considerations, Applicants assert that there is not any public policy or purpose under Section 11 (or otherwise) that would preclude offering the LRR under the terms and conditions stated herein.fund.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants have consented to the following conditions:
1. The Offering Document will contain concise, plain English statements that: (a) The LRR is suitable only for Contract owners who expect to hold their Contract as long term investments; and (b) if a significant amount of the Contract's Value is Start Printed Page 54554surrendered or withdrawn during the first five years after the Rider Date, the LRRs' benefits may be more than offset by that charge, and a Contract owner may be worse off if he or she had rejected the LRR.
2. The Offering Document will disclose in concise plain English the only aspect in which adding the LRR rider could disadvantage a Contract owner (i.e., through the possible imposition of the New Schedule of CDSC).
3. A Contract owner choosing to add the LRR will complete and sign the election form, which will prominently restate in concise plain English the statements required in Condition No. 1, and return it to Hartford. If the election form is more than 2 pages long, Hartford will use a separate document to obtain the Contract owner's acknowledgement of the statements referred to in Condition No. 1 above.
4. Applicants will maintain and make available the following separately identifiable records, for the time periods specified below, for review by the Commission upon request: (a) Records showing the level of LRR purchases and how it relates to the total number of Contract owners eligible to acquire the LRR (at least quarterly as a percentage of the number eligible); (b) copies of any form of Offering Document, prospectus disclosure, election form, acknowledgement form, or offering letter, regarding the offering of the LRR including the dates(s) used, and copies of any other written materials or scripts for presentations used by registered representatives regarding the LRR, including dates used; (c) records showing information about each LRR purchase that occurs, including the Contract number; the election form (and separate acknowledgement form, if any, used to obtain the Contract owner's acknowledgement of the statements required in Condition No. 1 above); the date such election or acknowledgement form was signed; the date of birth; address and telephone number of the Contract owner; the issue date of the LRR; the amount of the Contract's value on that date; persistency information relating to the Contract (date of any subsequent CDSCs and CDSC paid); the registered representative's name, CRD number, firm affiliation, branch office address and telephone number; the name of the registered representative's broker-dealer; and thea mount of commission paid to the registered representative that relates to the LRR; and (d) logs showing any Contract owner complaints received by it about the LRR, state insurance department inquiries to it about the LRR, or litigation, arbitration or other proceedings to which it is a party regarding the LRR.
5. Applicants will include the following information on the logs referred to in Condition No. 4(d) above: date of complaint or commencement of proceeding; name and address of the person making the complaint or commencing the proceeding; nature of the complaint or proceeding; and persons names or involved in the complaint or proceeding.
6. Applicants will retain (i) the records specified in Conditions Nos. 4(a) and 4(d) above for six years from creation of the record; (ii) the records specified in Condition No. 4(b) above for six years after the date of last use; and (iii) the records specified in Condition No. 4(c) for seven years from the Rider Date.
Conclusion
For the reasons discussed above, Applicants assert (1) that the LRR offers substantial benefits to Contract owners, will be advantageous for the majority of owners to whom it will be offered, and does not contravene any policy or purpose of Section 11 and (2) that approval of Applicant's offer of the LRR as described, and subject to the conditions set forth, in the application is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the requested order should therefore be granted.

This Prospectus describes information you should know before you purchase Series
II of Select Dimensions Variable Annuity. Please read it carefully.             

Select Dimensions Variable Annuity is a Contract between you and Hartford Life  
and Annuity Insurance Company where you agree to make at least one payment to us
and we agree to make a series of annuity payments to you at a later date. This  
annuity is a flexible premium, tax-deferred, variable annuity offered to both   
individuals and groups. It is:                                                  

x  Flexible, because you may add premium payments at any time.                  

x  Tax-deferred, which means you don't pay taxes until you take money out or    
until we start to make annuity payments to you.                           

x  Variable, because the value of your annuity will fluctuate with the          
performance of the underlying funds.                                      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At purchase, you allocate your premium payment, which is any purchase payment   
less any Premium Taxes, to "Sub-Accounts". These are subdivisions of our        
Separate Account, an account that keeps your annuity assets separate from our   
company assets. The Sub-Accounts then purchase shares of mutual funds set up    
exclusively for variable annuity or variable life insurance products. These are 
not the same mutual funds that you buy through your stockbroker or through a    
retail mutual fund. They may have similar investment strategies and the same    
portfolio managers as retail mutual funds. This annuity offers you portfolios   
with investment strategies ranging from conservative to aggressive and you may  
pick those portfolios that meet your investment goals and risk tolerance. The   
Sub-Accounts and the portfolios are listed below:

disapprove these securities or determine if the information is truthful or

(1) Each Premium Payment has its own Contingent Deferred Sales Charge schedule. 
See "Charges and Fees -- The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge." The     
    Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is not assessed on partial Surrenders which
do not exceed the Annual Withdrawal Amount.                             

(2) Length of time from each Premium Payment.                                   

(3) An annual $30 charge deducted on a Contract Anniversary or upon Surrender if
the Contract Value at either of those times is less than $50,000. It is 
   deducted proportionately from the Accounts in which you are invested at the
time of the charge.                                                     

The purpose of the Fee Table and Examples is to assist you in understanding     
various costs and expenses that you will pay directly or indirectly. The Fee    
Table and Examples reflect expenses of the Separate Account and underlying      
Funds. We will deduct any Premium Taxes that apply.                             

The Examples should not be considered a representation of past or future        
expenses and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. The Annual
Maintenance Fee has been reflected in the Examples by a method intended to show 
the "average" impact of the Annual Maintenance Fee on an investment in the      
Separate Account. We do this by approximating an "average" 0.06% annual charge.

(1) Closed to new investments or transfers of existing Contract Values.         

(2) With respect to the Mid-Cap Equity Portfolio, the expense information shown 
  in the table above has been restated to reflect the current fees. Prior to
December 31, 1999, the investment adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter   
Advisors Inc., assumed all expenses of the Portfolio and waived the     
    compensation provided for the Portfolio in its management agreement with the
Fund.                                                                   

(3) With respect to the High Yield, Mid-Cap Value, Emerging Markets Debt,       
 Emerging Markets Equity, Active International Allocation and Fixed Income
  Portfolios, the investment advisers have voluntarily agreed to waive their
    investment advisory fees and to reimburse certain expenses of the Portfolios
    if such fees would cause their respective "Total Fund Operating Expenses" to
exceed certain limits. The annual expense ratios for the Active         
    International Allocation Portfolio are annualized estimates. Including these
reductions, it is estimated that "Management Fees", Other Expenses and  
"Total Fund Operating Expenses" for the Portfolios would have been as   
follows:

SUMMARY                                                                         
HOW DO I PURCHASE THIS ANNUITY?                                                 

You must complete our application or order request and submit it to us for      
approval with your first premium payment. Your first premium payment must be at 
least $1,000 and subsequent premium payments must be at least $500. The minimum 
premium payment requirements may differ if you are participating in our         
automatic investing ("InvestEase-Registered Trademark-") program.               

-  For a limited time, usually within ten days after you receive your annuity,
you may cancel your annuity without paying a Contingent Deferred Sales  
  Charge. You bear the investment risk for your premium payment prior to our
receipt of your request for cancellation.                               

WHAT TYPE OF SALES CHARGE WILL I PAY?                                           
CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ("CDSC")                                       

You don't pay a sales charge when you purchase your Annuity. We may charge you a
CDSC when you partially or fully Surrender your Annuity. The CDSC will depend on
the amount you choose to Surrender and the length of time the Premium Payments  
you made have been in your Annuity. The percentage used to calculate the CDSC is
equal to:                                                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

IS THERE AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE?                                             

Yes. We deduct this $30 fee each year on your Contract Anniversary or when you  
completely Surrender your annuity, if, on either of those dates, the value of   
your annuity is less than $50,000.                                              

WHAT CHARGES WILL I PAY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?                                     

In addition to the Annual Maintenance Fee, you pay three different types of     
charges each year. The first type of charge is the fee you pay for insurance.   
This charge is:                                                                 

A mortality and expense risk charge that is subtracted daily and is equal to an 
annual charge of 1.25% of your Contract Value invested in the Portfolios.       

The second type of charge is the fee you pay for the Separate Account. This     
charge is:                                                                      

An administrative fee is .15% per year of the Contract Values held in the       
Separate Account.                                                               

The third type of charge is the fee you pay for the Portfolios. See the Annual  
Operation Expense Table for more complete information and the portfolios'       
prospectuses attached to this Prospectus.                                       

If an Optional Death Benefit is elected an additional charge is deducted daily  
from your Contract Value and is equal to 0.15% per year of your Contract Value  
invested in the Funds.                                                          

CAN I TAKE OUT ANY OF MY MONEY?                                                 

You can partially or fully Surrender your Contract subject to a Contingent      
Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC). You can partially Surrender your Contract without 
any CDSC applied to the Surrender under the following conditions:               

- Surrenders which don't exceed 15% of premium payments per Contract Year       
(Annual Withdrawal Amount);                                                 

- Surrenders made from premium payments invested more than seven years;         

- 100% Surrender of earnings after the seventh Contract Year;                   

- Surrenders under the nursing home waiver (described as Eligible Confinement in
the Contract); or                                                           

- Surrenders eligible for disability waiver under a group qualified plan.       

WILL HARTFORD PAY A DEATH BENEFIT?                                              

Your Contract has a Death Benefit and we offer an Optional Interest Accumulation
Death Benefit ("Optional Death Benefit") that you can elect for an additional   
fee. There is a Death Benefit if the Contract Owner, joint owner or Annuitant,  
die before we begin to make annuity payments. The Death Benefit will remain     
invested in the Sub-Accounts according to your last instructions (unless        
otherwise mutually specified by your Beneficiaries) and will be subject to      
market fluctuations.                                                            

IF YOU DO NOT ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, the Death Benefit, which we will
calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be the greater of: 

- 100% of the total premium payments you have made to us reduced by any         
subsequent Surrenders;                                                      

- The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                        

- Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                     

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on Contract  
Anniversaries, of Contract Values, premium payments and partial Surrenders. We  
will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary prior to the  
deceased's 81st birthday or date of death. The Anniversary Value is equal to the
Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by the dollar amount of  
any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by the dollar      
amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary. The Maximum Anniversary
Value is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
equal to the greatest Anniversary Value attained from this series of            
calculations.                                                                   

IF YOU ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, the Death Benefit, which we will       
calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be the greater of: 

- 100% of the total premium payments you have made to us reduced by any         
subsequent Surrenders;                                                      

- The Contract Value of your annuity;                                           
- Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is the highest Anniversary Value before 
the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death; or                           

- Your Interest Accumulation Value.                                             

THE INTEREST ACCUMULATION VALUE is calculated by accumulating interest on your  
premium payments at a rate of 5% per year up to the deceased's 81st birthday or 
date of death, assuming you have not taken any Surrenders. If you have taken any
Surrenders, the 5% will be accumulated on your premium payments, but there will 
be an adjustment for any of the Surrenders. This adjustment will reduce the     
Optional Death Benefit proportionally for the Surrenders. The Optional Death    
Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of premium payments, less proportional  
adjustments for any Surrenders. For examples on how the Optional Death Benefit  
is calculated see "Appendix II". If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we    
will deduct an additional charge daily from your Contract Value equal to .15%   
per year of the Sub-Account value. The Optional Death Benefit may not be        
available if the Contract Owner or Annuitant is age 75 or older. For Contracts  
issued in the state of Washington, the Optional Death Benefit is not available. 

If you elect the Optional Death Benefit at any time after you purchase your     
annuity, the Optional Death Benefit calculation will be different.              

SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If a Beneficiary is the Contract Owner's       
spouse, that portion of the Contract for which the spouse is the Beneficiary    
will continue with the spouse as Contract Owner, unless the spouse elects to    
receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment. If the Contract continues with 
the spouse as Contract Owner, we will adjust the Contract Value to the amount   
that we would have paid as the Death Benefit payment, had the spouse elected to 
receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment or as an annuity payment option.
Spousal Contract Continuation will only apply one time for each Contract.       

WHAT ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?                                     

When you purchase your annuity, you may choose one of the following annuity     
payment options, or receive a lump sum payment:                                 

LIFE ANNUITY where we make scheduled payments for the Annuitant's life.         
 -  Payments under this option stop upon the death of the Annuitant, even if the
Annuitant dies after one payment.                                       

LIFE ANNUITY WITH CASH REFUND where we make payments during the life of the     
Annuitant and when the Annuitant dies, we pay the remaining value to the        
Beneficiary. The remaining value is calculated at the time we receive Due Proof 
of Death by subtracting the annuity payments already made from the Contract     
Value, less any applicable Premium Taxes, applied to this annuity payment       
option.                                                                         

 -  This option is only available if you select a variable dollar amount payment
with the 5% AIR or fixed dollar amount annuity payments.

 the value of the remaining payments to your Beneficiary, either in a lump
sum or we will continue payments until the end of the period selected.  

You must begin to take payments before the Annuitant's 90th birthday or the end 
of the 10th Contract Year, which ever comes later, unless you elect a later date
to begin receiving payments subject to the laws and regulations then in effect  
and our approval. If you do not tell us what annuity payment option you want    
before that time, we will pay you under the Life Annuity with a 10 year period  
certain. You and Hartford can agree to start payments at a later date if the    
laws in effect allow us to defer payment and we agree to allow you to defer.

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Separate Account is where we set aside and invest the assets of some of our 
annuity contracts, including this Contract. The Separate Account was established
on June 22, 1994 and is registered as a unit investment trust under the         
Investment Company Act of 1940. This registration does not involve supervision  
by the Commission of the management or the investment practices of the Separate 
Account or Hartford. The Separate Account meets the definition of "Separate
Account" under federal securities law. This Separate Account holds only assets  
for variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account:                           

- Holds assets for the benefit of you and other Contract Owners, and the persons
entitled to the payments described in the Contract.                         

- Is not subject to the liabilities arising out of any other business Hartford  
may conduct.                                                                

- Is not affected by the rate of return of Hartford's General Account or by the 
investment performance of any of Hartford's other Separate Accounts.        

- May be subject to liabilities from a Sub-Account of the Separate Account which
holds assets of other variable annuity contracts offered by the Separate    
Account which are not described in this Prospectus.                         

- Is credited with income and gains, and takes losses, whether or not realized, 
from the assets it holds.                                                   

We do not guarantee the investment results of the Separate Account. There is no 
assurance that the value of your Annuity will equal the total of the payments   
you make to us.                                                                 

THE FUNDS                                                                       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The underlying investment for the Contracts are shares of the portfolios of     
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, The Universal   
Institutional Funds, Inc., and Van Kampen Life Investment Trust, all open-ended 
management investment companies. The underlying portfolios corresponding to each
Sub-Account and their investment objectives are described below. Hartford       
reserves the right, subject to compliance with the law, to offer additional     
portfolios with differing investment objectives. The portfolios may not be      
available in all states.                                                        

We do not guarantee the investment results of any of the underlying portfolios. 
Since each underlying portfolio has different investment objectives, each is    
subject to different risks. These risks and the portfolio's expenses are more   
fully described in the accompanying Funds' prospectuses and the Statements of   
Additional Information. The Funds' prospectuses should be read in conjunction   
with this Prospectus before investing.                                          

The investment goals of each of the portfolios are as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER SELECT DIMENSIONS INVESTMENT SERIES:                 

MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO -- Seeks high current income, preservation of capital and
liquidity by investing in the following money market instruments: U.S.          
Government securities, obligations of U.S. regulated banks and savings          
institutions having total assets of more than $1 billion, or less than $1       
billion if such are fully federally insured as to principal (the interest may   
not be insured), repurchase agreements and high grade corporate debt obligations
maturing in thirteen months or less.                                            

NORTH AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO (EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 7, 1999,    
CLOSED TO NEW INVESTMENTS OR TRANSFERS OF EXISTING CONTRACT VALUES) -- Seeks to 
earn a high level of current income while maintaining relatively low volatility 
of principal, by investing primarily in investment grade fixed-income securities
issued or guaranteed by the U.S., Canadian or Mexican governments.              

DIVERSIFIED INCOME PORTFOLIO -- Seeks, as a primary objective, to earn a high   
level of current income and, as a secondary objective, to maximize total return,
but only to the extent consistent with its primary objective, by equally        
allocating its assets among three separate groupings of fixed-income securities.
Up to one-third of the securities in which the Diversified Income Portfolio may 
invest will include securities rated Baa/BBB or lower. See the Special          
Considerations for investments for high yield securities disclosed in the Fund's
prospectus.                                                                     

BALANCED GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to provide capital growth with reasonable    
current income by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 60% of its
total assets in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of companies which have
a record of paying dividends and, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, have
the potential for increasing dividends and in securities convertible into common
stock, and at least 25% of its total assets in investment grade fixed-income    
(fixed-rate and adjustable-rate) securities such as corporate notes and bonds   
and obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies and   
its instrumentalities.                                                          

UTILITIES PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to provide both capital appreciation and current   
income.                                                                         

DIVIDEND GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to provide reasonable current income and     
long-term growth of income and capital by investing primarily in common stock of
companies with a record of paying dividends and the potential for increasing    
dividends.                                                                      

VALUE-ADDED MARKET PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to achieve a high level of total return on
its assets through a combination of capital appreciation and current income, by 
investing, on an equally-weighted basis, in a diversified portfolio of common   
stocks of the companies which are represented in the Standard & Poor's 500      
Composite Stock Price Index.                                                    

GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in 
common stocks and securities convertible into common stocks issued by domestic  
and foreign companies.                                                          

AMERICAN OPPORTUNITIES PORTFOLIO (FORMERLY NAMED AMERICAN VALUE                 
PORTFOLIO) -- Seeks long-term capital growth consistent with an effort to reduce
volatility, by investing principally in common stock of companies in industries 
which, at the time of the investment, are believed to be attractively valued    
given their above average relative earnings growth potential at that time.      

MID-CAP EQUITY PORTFOLIO (FORMERLY NAMED MID-CAP GROWTH PORTFOLIO) -- Seeks     
long-term capital growth by investing primarily in equity securities of medium  
sized companies (that is, companies whose equity market capitalization falls    
within the range of companies comprising the S&P 400 Index.                     

GLOBAL EQUITY PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to obtain total return on its assets primarily 
through long-term capital growth and, to a lesser extent, from income, through  
investments in all types of common stocks and equivalents (such as convertible  
securities and warrants), preferred stocks and bonds and other debt obligations 
of domestic and foreign companies, governments and international organizations. 

DEVELOPING GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term capital growth by investing      
primarily in common stocks of smaller and medium-sized companies that, in the   
opinion of the Investment Manager, have the potential for growing more rapidly  
than the economy and which may benefit from new products or services,           
technological developments or changes in management.                            

EMERGING MARKETS PORTFOLIO (EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 7, 1999, CLOSED TO NEW          
INVESTMENTS OR TRANSFERS OF EXISTING CONTRACT VALUES) -- Seeks long-term capital
appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of companies in        
emerging market countries. The Emerging Markets Portfolio may invest up to 35%  
of its total assets in high risk fixed-income securities that are rated below   
investment grade or are unrated (commonly referred to as "junk bonds"). See the 
Special Considerations for investments in high yield securities disclosed in the
Fund's prospectus.                                                              

THE UNIVERSAL INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS, INC.:                                        

HIGH YIELD PORTFOLIO -- Seeks above-average total return over a market cycle of 
three to five years by investing primarily in high yield securities (commonly   
referred to as "junk bonds"). The Portfolio also may invest in investment grade 
fixed income securities, including U.S. Government securities, corporate bonds  
and mortgage securities. The Portfolio may invest to a limited extent in foreign
fixed income securities, including emerging market securities. The Investment   
Adviser may use futures, swaps and other types of derivatives in managing the   
Portfolio.                                                                      

MID CAP VALUE PORTFOLIO -- Seeks above-average total return over a market cycle 
of three to five years by investing in common stocks of companies with          
capitalizations in the range of companies included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index  
(currently $500 million to $6 billion). The Portfolio purchases stocks that     
typically do not pay dividends. The Investment Adviser analyzes securities to   
identify stocks that are undervalued, and measures the relative attractiveness  
of the Portfolio's current holdings against potential purchases.

HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                   17
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMERGING MARKETS DEBT PORTFOLIO -- Seeks high total return by investing         
primarily in fixed income securities of government and government-related       
issuers and, to a lesser extent, of corporate issuers located in emerging market
countries. The Investment Adviser seeks high total return by investing in a     
portfolio of emerging market debt that offers low correlation to many other     
asset classes. Using macroeconomic and fundamental analysis, the Investment     
Adviser seeks to identify developing countries that are undervalued and have    
attractive or improving fundamentals. After the country allocation is           
determined, the sector and security selection is made within each county.       

EMERGING MARKETS EQUITY PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term capital appreciation by    
investing primarily in equity securities of issuers in emerging market          
countries. The Investment Adviser seeks to maximize returns by investing in     
growth-oriented equity securities in emerging markets. The Investment Adviser's 
investment approach combines top-down country allocation with bottom-up stock   
selection. Investment selection criteria include attractive growth              
characteristics, reasonable valuations and managements with a strong shareholder
value orientation.                                                              

FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO -- Seeks above-average total return over a market cycle  
of three to five years by investing primarily in a diversified mix of dollar    
denominated investment grade fixed income securities, particularly U.S.         
Government, corporate and mortgage securities. The Portfolio ordinarily will    
maintain an average weighted maturity in excess of five years. The Portfolio may
invest opportunistically in non-dollar denominated securities and below         
investment grade securities; and it may use futures, swaps and other types of   
derivatives in managing the Portfolio.                                          

ACTIVE INTERNATIONAL ALLOCATION PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term capital            
appreciation by investing primarily in accordance with country and sector       
weightings determined by the investment adviser in equity securities of non-U.S.
issuers which, in the aggregate, replicate broad-market indices. The Investment 
Adviser seeks to maintain a diversified portfolio of international equity       
securities based on a top-down approach that emphasizes country and sector      
selection and weighting rather than individual stock selection. The Investment  
Adviser capitalizes on the significance of country and sector selection in      
international equity portfolio returns by over and underweighting countries     
based on three factors: (i) valuation; (ii) fundamental change; and             
(iii) short-term market momentum/technicals.                                    

VAN KAMPEN LIFE INVESTMENT TRUST:                                               

STRATEGIC STOCK PORTFOLIO -- Seeks an above average total return through a      
combination of potential capital appreciation and dividend income, consistent   
with the preservation of invested capital. Under normal market conditions, the  
Portfolio's investment adviser seeks to achieve the investment objectives by    
investing in a portfolio of high dividend yielding equity securities of         
companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or in the Morgan Stanley 
Capital International USA Index.                                                

ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO -- Seeks capital appreciation through investments in       
securities believed by the Portfolio's investment adviser to have above average 
potential for capital appreciation.

indirect wholly owned subsidiary of MSDW. Van Kampen Investments Inc. is a      
diversified asset management company with more than two million retail investor 
accounts, extensive capabilities for managing institutional portfolios, and more
than $90 billion under management or supervision as of December 31, 1999. Van   
Kampen Investments Inc.'s more than 50 open-end and 39 closed-end funds and more

authorized dealers nationwide.                                                  

MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING -- Shares of the Portfolios are sold to our other      
Separate Accounts and our insurance company affiliates or other unaffiliated    
insurance companies to serve as the underlying investment for both variable     
annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts, a practice known as    
"mixed and shared funding." As a result, there is a possibility that a material 
conflict may arise between the interests of Contract Owners, and of owners of   
other contracts whose contract values are allocated to one or more of these     
other Separate Accounts investing in any one of the Portfolios. In the event of 
any such material conflicts, we will consider what action may be appropriate,   
including removing the Portfolio from the Separate Account or replacing the     
Portfolio with another Portfolio. There are certain risks associated with mixed 
and shared funding, as disclosed in the portfolios' prospectus.                 

VOTING RIGHTS -- We are the legal owners of all Portfolio shares held in the    
Separate Account and we have the right to vote at the Portfolio's shareholder   
meetings. To the extent required by federal securities laws or regulations, we  
will:                                                                           

- Notify you of any Portfolio shareholders' meeting if the shares held for your 
Contract may be voted.                                                      

- Send proxy materials and a form of instructions that you can use to tell us   
how to vote the Portfolio shares held for your Contract.                    

- Arrange for the handling and tallying of proxies received from Contract       
Owners.                                                                     

- Vote all Portfolio shares attributable to your Contract according to          
instructions received from you, and                                         

- Vote all Portfolio shares for which no voting instructions are received in the
same proportion as shares for which instructions have been received.        

If any federal securities laws or regulations, or their present interpretation, 
change to permit us to vote Portfolio shares on our own, we may decide to do so.
You may attend any Shareholder Meeting at which shares held for your Contract   
may be voted. After we begin to make Annuity Payments to you, the number of     
votes you have will decrease.                                                   

SUBSTITUTIONS, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS OF PORTFOLIOS -- We reserve the right,   
subject to any applicable law, to make certain changes to the Portfolios offered
under your Contract. We may, in our sole discretion, establish new Portfolios.  
New Portfolios will be will be made available to existing Contract Owners as we 
determined appropriate. We may also close one or more Portfolios to additional  
payments or transfers from existing Sub-Accounts.                               

We reserve the right to eliminate the shares of any of the Portfolios for any   
reason and to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the
shares of any Portfolio already purchased or to be purchased in the future by   
the Separate Account. To the extent required by the 1940 Act, substitutions of  
shares attributable to your interest in a Portfolio will not be made until we   
have the approval of the Commission and we have notified you of the change.     

In the event of any substitution or change, We may, by appropriate endorsement, 
make such changes in the Contract as may be necessary or appropriate to reflect 
such substitution or change. If we decide that it is in the best interest of the
Contract Owners, the Separate Account may be operated as a management company   
under the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by law, may be de-registered     
under the 1940 Act in the event such registration is no longer required, or may 
be combined with one or more other Separate Accounts.                           

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES -- Hartford has entered into agreements with the        
investment advisers or distributors of many of the Funds. Under the terms of    
these agreements, Hartford provides administrative services and the Funds pay a 
fee to Hartford that is usually based on an annual percentage of the average    
daily net assets of the Funds. These agreements may be different for each Fund  
or each Fund family.

PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION 

The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information      
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is     
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future 
performance.                                                                    

When a Sub-Account advertises its STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN, it will usually be 
calculated for one year, five years, and ten years or some other relevant       
periods if the Sub-Account has not been in existence for at least ten years.    
Total return is measured by comparing the value of an investment in the         
Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant period to the value of the         
investment at the end of the period and assumes that the Optional Death Benefit 
has not been elected.                                                           

The Separate Account may also advertise NON-STANDARD TOTAL RETURNS THAT PRE-DATE
THE INCEPTION DATE OF THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT. These non-standardized total returns
are calculated by assuming that the Sub-Accounts have been in existence for the 
same periods as the underlying Portfolios and by taking deductions for charges  
equal to those currently assessed against the Sub-Accounts. These               
non-standardized returns must be accompanied by standardized total returns.     

If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise YIELD IN ADDITION TO TOTAL RETURN.
The yield will be computed in the following manner: The net investment income   
per unit earned during a recent one month period, divided by the unit value on  
the last day of the period. This figure reflects the recurring charges at the   
Separate Account level including the Annual Maintenance Fee.                    

The Money Market Portfolio Sub-Account may advertise yield and effective yield. 
The yield of a Sub-Account is based upon the income earned by the Sub-Account   
over a seven-day period and then annualized, i.e. the income earned in the      
period is assumed to be earned every seven days over a 52-week period and stated
as a percentage of the investment. Effective yield is calculated similarly but  
when annualized, the income earned by the investment is assumed to be reinvested
in Sub-Account units and thus compounded in the course of a 52-week period.     
Yield and effective yield reflect the recurring charges at the Separate Account 
level including the Annual Maintenance Fee.                                     

We may provide information on various topics to Contract Owners and prospective 
Contract Owners in advertising, sales literature or other materials. These      
topics may include the relationship between sectors of the economy and the      
economy as a whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment     
strategies and techniques (such as value investing, dollar cost averaging and   
asset allocation), the advantages and disadvantages of investing in tax-deferred
and taxable instruments, customer profiles and hypothetical purchase scenarios, 
financial management and tax and retirement planning, and other investment      
alternatives, including comparisons between the Contracts and the               
characteristics of and market for such alternatives.                            

THE FIXED ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW: THIS PORTION OF THE CONTRACT RELATING TO 
THE FIXED ACCOUNTS IS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 ("1933    
ACT") AND THE FIXED ACCOUNTS ARE NOT REGISTERED AS INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER   
THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 ("1940 ACT"). NONE OF THE FIXED ACCOUNTS OR  
ANY OF THEIR INTERESTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF THE 1933
ACT OR THE 1940 ACT, AND THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS
NOT REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE FIXED ACCOUNTS. THE FOLLOWING         
DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FIXED ACCOUNTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN GENERALLY         
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS REGARDING THE ACCURACY AND 
COMPLETENESS OF DISCLOSURE.                                                     

Payments and Contract Values allocated to a Fixed Account become a part of our  
general assets. We invest the assets of the General Account in accordance with  
applicable law governing the investments of insurance company General Accounts. 
We have more than one Fixed Account. The standard Fixed Account (the "Fixed
Account") and then a number of DCA Program Fixed Accounts, which we collectively
refer to as the "Fixed Accounts".                                               

Currently, we guarantee that we will credit interest at a rate of not less than 
3% per year, compounded annually, to amounts you allocate to the Fixed Account. 
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to credit interest at a rate in   
excess of 3% per year. You assume the risk that interest credited to the Fixed  
Account may not exceed the minimum guarantee of 3% for any given year.          

We will periodically publish the Fixed Account interest rates currently in      
effect. There is no specific formula for the determination of interest rates.   
Some of the factors that we may consider in determining whether to credit excess
interest are: general economic trends, rates of return currently available and  
anticipated on our investments, regulatory and tax requirements and competitive 
factors. We will account for any deductions, Surrenders or transfers from the   
Fixed Account on a "first-in", "first-out" basis. For Contracts issued in the   
state of New York, Fixed Account interest rates may vary from other states.     

From time to time, we may credit increased interest rates to Contract Owners    
under certain programs established at our sole discretion.                      

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PLUS ("DCA PLUS") PROGRAMS -- These programs will use     
designated DCA Program Fixed Accounts. Currently, Contract Owners may enroll in 
a special pre-authorized transfer program known as our Dollar Cost Averaging    
Plus Program (the "Program"). Under this Program, Contract Owners who enroll may
allocate a minimum of $5,000 of

their payment into the appropriate DCA Program Fixed Account (we may allow a    
lower minimum premium payment for qualified plan transfers or rollovers,        
including IRAs) and pre-authorize transfers to any of the Sub-Accounts under    
either the 6-Month Transfer Program or 12-Month Transfer Program. The 6-Month   
Transfer Program and the 12-Month Transfer Program will generally have different
credited interest rates. Under the 6-Month Transfer Program, the interest rate  
can accrue up to 6 months and all payments and accrued interest must be         
transferred from the DCA Program Fixed Account in use to the selected Sub-      
Accounts in 3 to 6 months. Under the 12-Month Transfer Program, the interest    
rate can accrue up to 12 months and all payments and accrued interest must be   
transferred to the selected Sub-Accounts in 7 to 12 months. This will be        
accomplished by monthly transfers for the period selected and a final transfer  
of the entire amount remaining in the Program, which will generally be less than
the prior monthly transfer amounts. Contract Owners who purchase their Contracts
in New York have a different DCA Plus Program, which includes different credited
interest rates. Currently, only one DCA Plus Program transfer period is         
available in New York, but that period allows transfers to selected Sub-Accounts
in 3 to 12 months.                                                              

The pre-authorized transfers will begin within 15 days after we receive the     
initial Program payment and complete enrollment instructions. If we do not      
receive complete Program enrollment instructions within 15 days of receipt of   
the initial Program payment, the Program will be voided and the entire balance  
in the Program will be transferred to the Accounts designated by you. If you do 
not designate an Account, we will transfer any remaining amounts to the Fixed   
Account and you will receive the Fixed Account's current effective interest     
rate. Any subsequent payments we receive within the Program period selected will
be allocated to the Sub-Accounts over the remainder of that Program transfer    
period, unless otherwise directed by You.                                       

You may only have one dollar cost averaging program in place at one time, this  
means one standard dollar cost averaging plan or one Dollar Cost Averaging Plus 
Program.                                                                        

You may elect to terminate the pre-authorized transfers by calling or writing us
of your intent to cancel enrollment in the Program. Upon cancellation of        
enrollment in the Program, you will no longer receive the increased interest    
rate and unless we receive instructions to the contrary, the amounts remaining  
in the DCA Program Fixed Account may be transferred to the Fixed Account and    
accrue the interest rate currently in effect.                                   

Transfers made under a Dollar Cost Averaging Program do not count towards the   
twelve transfers each Contract Year that we allow without charge and are not    
subject to our rule that prohibits any two transfers from occurring on          
Consecutive Valuation Days.                                                     

We reserve the right to discontinue, modify or amend the Program or any other   
interest rate program established by Hartford. Any change to the Program will   
not affect Contract Owners currently enrolled in the Program.                   

THE CONTRACT 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE CONTRACT OFFERED -- The Contracts are individual or group tax-deferred      
variable annuity contracts. They are designed for retirement planning purposes  
and may be purchased by any individual, group or trust, including; (a) any      
trustee or custodian for a retirement plan qualified under Sections 401(a), or  
403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (which includes Section 401(k));            
(b) annuity purchase plans adopted by public school systems and certain         
tax-exempt organizations according to Section 403(b) of the Code;               
(c) Individual Retirement Annuities adopted according to Section 408 of the     
Code; (d) employee pension plans established for employees by a state, a        
political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of either a   
state or a political subdivision of a state, and (e) certain eligible deferred  
compensation plans as defined in Section 457 of the Code ("Qualified            
Contracts"). If you are purchasing the Contract for use in an IRA or other      
qualified retirement plan, you should consider other features of the Contract   
besides tax deferral, since any investment vehicle used within an IRA or other  
qualified plan receives tax deferred treatment under the Code.                  

PURCHASING A CONTRACT -- A prospective Contract Owner may purchase a Contract by
completing and submitting an application or an order request along with an      
initial premium payment to the Administrative Office of the Company. The maximum
age for Annuitant, Owner and Joint Owner on the Contract Issue Date is 85.      
Generally, the minimum premium payment is $1,000. The minimum subsequent premium
payment is $500. Certain plans may be allowed to make smaller periodic premium  
payments. Unless we give our prior approval, we will not accept a premium       
payment in excess of $1,000,000. Each premium payment, which is your premium    
payment after the deduction of any applicable Premium Taxes, may be split among 
the various Accounts subject to minimum amounts then in effect. For Contracts   
issued in Oregon, premium payments will only be accepted prior to the third     
Contract Anniversary. For Contracts issued in Massachusetts, subsequent premium 
payments will only be accepted until the Annuitant's 63rd birthday or the third 
Contract Anniversary, whichever is later. We will send you a confirmation notice
upon receipt and acceptance of your premium payment.                            

In Oregon, Premium Payments are only allowed in the first three Contract Years. 
In Massachusetts, Premium Payments are only allowed in the first three Contract 
Years or until the Contract Owner turns 63, whichever is later.                 

RIGHT TO EXAMINE THE CONTRACT -- If you are not satisfied with your purchase,   
you may cancel the Contract by returning it within 10 days (or longer in some   
states) after you receive it. You must send a written request for cancellation  
along with the Contract. We will, without deduction for any CDSC normally       
assessed, pay you an amount equal to the Contract Value. YOU

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEAR THE INVESTMENT RISK DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO OUR RECEIPT OF YOUR REQUEST 
FOR CANCELLATION. We will refund the premium paid only for Individual Retirement
Annuities, if returned within seven days of receipt, and in those states where  
required by law.                                                                

CREDITING AND VALUATION -- Your premium payment, which is the balance remaining 
after the deduction of any Premium Tax, is credited to your Contract within two 
business days of receipt by us at our Administrative Office of a properly       
completed application or an order to purchase a Contract and the premium        
payment. The payment will be credited to the Accounts according to the          
instructions we receive from you.                                               

If your application or other information is incomplete when received, your      
payment will be credited to the Accounts within five business days of receipt of
complete information. If the payment is not credited within five business days, 
it will be immediately returned to you unless you have been informed of the     
delay and tell us not to return it.                                             

Subsequent premium payments are priced on the Valuation Day we receive the      
payment in our Administrative Office, provided it is received before the New    
York Stock Exchange closes. Unless otherwise specified, We will allocate any    
subsequent payments to Accounts according to your most recent instructions.     

CONTRACT VALUE -- BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE                          

Your Contract Value reflects interest rate credited any amounts allocated to the
Fixed Accounts and the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts where you have
payments allocated.                                                             

SUB-ACCOUNT VALUES -- Your Sub-Account Values on the date we issue your Contract
is the amount of your premium payment allocated to any Sub-Account. After that, 
we determine your Sub-Account value by determining the Accumulation Unit value  
for each Sub-Account, and then multiplying that value by the number of those    
units. Sub-Account Value reflects any variation of the interest income,         
dividends, net capital gains or losses, realized or unrealized, and any amounts 
transferred into or out of that Sub-Account.                                    

ACCUMULATION UNITS -- When Premium Payments are credited to your Sub-Accounts,  
they are converted into accumulation Units by dividing the amount of your       
Premium Payments, minus any Premium Taxes, by the Accumulation Unit Value for   
that day. The more Premium Payments you put into your Contract, the more        
Accumulation Units you will own. You decrease the number of Accumulation Units  
you have by requesting Surrenders, transferring money out of an Account,        
settling a Death Benefit claim or by annuitizing your Contract.                 

ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUE -- The Accumulation Unit value for each Sub-Account was 
arbitrarily set initially at $1 when the Sub-Account began operations. After    
that, the Accumulation Unit value for each Sub-Account will equal (a) the       
Accumulation Unit value at the end of the preceding Valuation Day multiplied by 
(b) the Net Investment Factor (see the definition below) for the Valuation Day  
for which the Accumulation Unit value is being calculated.                      

You will be advised, at least semiannually, of the number of Accumulation Units 
credited to each Sub-Account, the current Accumulation Unit values, and the     
total value of your Contract.                                                   

THE NET INVESTMENT FACTOR (BEFORE AND AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT            
DATE) -- The Net Investment Factor is an index applied to measure the investment
performance of a Sub-Account from one Valuation Period to the next. For each    
Sub-Account, the Net Investment Factor reflects the investment performance of   
the Portfolio in which that Sub-Account invests and the charges assessed against
that Sub-Account for a Valuation Period. The Net Investment Factor is calculated
by dividing (a) by (b) and subtracting (c) from the result, where:              

- Is the Net Asset Value of the Portfolio held in that Sub-Account, determined  
at the end of the current Valuation Period (plus the per share amount of any
dividends or capital gains distributions made by that Portfolio);           

- Is the Net Asset Value of the Portfolio held in the Sub-Account, determined at
the beginning of the Valuation Period;                                      

- Is a daily factor representing the mortality and expense risk charge and any  
optional charges deducted from the Sub-Account, adjusted for the number of  
days in the Valuation Period.                                               

CONTRACT VALUE TRANSFERS BEFORE AND AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE         

You may transfer your Contract Values from one or more Accounts to another      
Account free of charge. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TRANSFERS TO
12 PER CONTRACT YEAR, WITH NO 2 TRANSFERS OCCURRING ON CONSECUTIVE VALUATION    
DAYS. There may be limitations on transfers to and from the Fixed Accumulation  
Features that are described in your Contract. Some states may allow us to limit 
the dollar amount transferred.                                                  

TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSFERS -- In most states, you, or your                
attorney-in-fact acting pursuant to a power of attorney, can make transfers:    

- By calling us at (800) 862-6668                                               

- Electronically, when available, by the Internet through our website at        
http://online.hartford.com                                                  

Transfer instructions received by telephone on any Valuation Day before the     
close of the New York Stock Exchange will be carried out that day. Otherwise,   
the instructions will be carried out at the close of the New York Stock Exchange
on the next Valuation Day.                                                      

Transfer instructions you send electronically are considered to be received by  
Hartford at the time and date stated on the electronic acknowledgement Hartford 
returns to you. If the time and date indicated on the acknowledgement is before 
the close of the New York Stock Exchange on a Valuation Day, the instructions   
will be carried out that day. Otherwise, the instructions will be carried out at
the close of the New York Stock Exchange the

We will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer. You are          
responsible for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any
errors within 30 days of receiving the confirmation.                            

Telephone or Internet transfer requests may currently only be cancelled by      
calling us at (800) 862-6668 before the close of the New York Stock Exchange.   

Hartford, our agents or our affiliates are NOT responsible for losses resulting 
from telephone or electronic requests that we believe are genuine. We will use  
reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions received by telephone or     
through our website are genuine, including a requirement that contract owners   
provide certain identification information, including a personal identification 
number. We record all telephone transfer instructions. We reserve the right to  
suspend, modify, or terminate telephone or electronic transfer privileges at any
time.                                                                           

We may permit you to pre-authorize transfers under certain circumstances.       
Transfers between the Accounts may be made both before and after the Annuity    
Commencement Date. Generally, the minimum allocation to any Sub-Account may not 
be less than $500. All percentage (%) allocations must be in whole numbers      
(e.g., 1%). No minimum balance is presently required in any Account.            

The right to reallocate Contract Values is subject to modification if we        
determine, in our sole opinion, that the exercise of that right by one or more  
Contract Owners is, or would be, to the disadvantage of other Contract Owners.  
Any modification could be applied to transfers to or from some or all of the    
Accounts and could include, but not be limited to, the requirement of a minimum 
time period between each transfer, not accepting transfer requests of an agent  
acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one Contract Owner, or  
limiting the dollar amount that may be transferred between the Sub-Accounts by  
you at any one time. SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY BE APPLIED IN ANY MANNER REASONABLY  
DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY USE OF THE TRANSFER RIGHT WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE TO THE
DISADVANTAGE OF OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS.                                          

For Contracts issued in THE STATE OF FLORIDA, MARYLAND OR OREGON, the           
reservation of rights set forth in the preceding paragraph is limited to: (i)   
requiring up to a maximum of 10 Valuation Days between each transfer; (ii)      
limiting the amount to be transferred on any one Valuation Day to no more than  
$2 million; and (iii) upon 30 days prior written notice, to only accepting      
transfer instructions from you and not from your representative, agent or person
acting under a power of attorney for you.                                       

Currently, we will not accept instructions from agents acting under a power of  
attorney of multiple Contract Owners whose Accounts aggregate more than $2      
million, unless the agent has entered into a third party transfer services      
agreement with us.                                                              

Transfers made under a Dollar Cost Averaging Program do not count towards the   
twelve transfers each Contract Year that we allow without charge and are not    
subject to our rule that prohibits any two transfers from occurring on          
Consecutive Valuation Days.                                                     

SURRENDERS                                                                      
Contract Owners should consult their qualified tax adviser regarding the tax    
consequences of a Surrender.                                                    

-  A Surrender made before age 59 1/2 may result in adverse tax consequences, 
including a penalty tax of 10% of the taxable portion of the Surrender  
Value. (See "Federal Tax Considerations")                               

PAYMENT OF SURRENDER AMOUNTS -- Payment of any request for a full or partial    
Surrender from the Accounts will be made as soon as possible and in any event no
later than seven days after we receive the request at our Administrative Office.

There may be postponement in the payment of Surrender Amounts whenever (a) the  
New York Stock Exchange is closed; (b) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is
restricted as determined by the Commission; (c) the Commission permits          
postponement and so orders; or (d) the Commission determines that an emergency  
exists making valuation of the amounts or disposal of securities not reasonably 
practicable.                                                                    

FULL SURRENDERS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- At any time prior to  
the Annuity Commencement Date, you have the right to fully Surrender the        
Contract. In such event, the Surrender Value of the Contract may be taken in the
form of a lump sum cash payment.                                                

The Surrender Value of the Contract is equal to the Contract Value less any     
Premium Taxes, the Annual Maintenance Fee and any Contingent Deferred Sales     
Charge, if applicable. The Surrender Value may be more or less than the amount  
of the payments made to your Contract.                                          

PARTIAL SURRENDERS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may make a     
partial Surrender of your Contract Value at any time prior to the Annuity       
Commencement Date so long as the amount Surrendered is at least equal to our    
minimum amount rules then in effect. Additionally, if the remaining Contract    
Value following a Surrender is less than $500, we may terminate the Contract and
pay the Surrender Value. For Contracts issued in TEXAS, the Contract will not be
terminated when the remaining Contract Value after a Surrender is less than $500
unless there were no payments made during the previous 2 Contract Years.        

WHEN REQUESTING A PARTIAL SURRENDER, YOU SHOULD SPECIFY THE ACCOUNT(S) FROM     
WHICH THE PARTIAL SURRENDER WILL BE TAKEN; OTHERWISE, THE SURRENDER WILL BE     
TAKEN ON A PRO RATA BASIS ACCORDING TO THE VALUE IN EACH ACTIVE ACCOUNT.        

We may permit you to pre-authorize partial Surrenders subject to certain        
limitations then in effect. We permit partial Surrenders by telephone subject to
dollar amount limitations in effect at the time you request the Surrender. To   
request partial Surrenders by

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
telephone, you must have completed and returned to us a Telephone Redemption    
Program Enrollment Form authorizing telephone Surrenders. If there are joint    
Contract Owners, both must authorize us to accept telephone instructions and    
agree that We may accept telephone instructions for partial Surrenders from     
either Contract Owner. Partial Surrender requests will not be honored until we  
receive all required documents in proper form.                                  

Telephone authorization will remain valid until (a) we receive written notice of
revocation by you, or, in the case of joint Contract Owners, written notice from
either Contract Owner; (b) we discontinue the privilege; or (c) we have reason  
to believe that you have entered into a market timing agreement with an         
investment adviser and/or broker/dealer.                                        

We may record any telephone calls to verify data concerning transactions and may
adopt other procedures to confirm that telephone instructions are genuine. We   
will not be liable for losses or expenses arising out of telephone instructions 
reasonably believed to be genuine.                                              

In order to obtain that day's unit values on Surrender, We must receive         
telephone Surrender instructions prior to the close of trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange (generally 4:00 p.m.).                                           

We may modify, suspend, or terminate telephone transaction privileges at any    
time.                                                                           
SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may fully Surrender your  
Contract on or after the Annuity Commencement Date if you elect the Payment For 
a Period Certain Settlement Option. We pay you the commuted value that is equal 
to the present value of the remaining payments we are scheduled to make less any
applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. The commuted value is determined as
of the date we receive your written request for Surrender at our Administrative 
Office.                                                                         

Partial Surrenders are permitted after the Annuity Commencement Date if you     
elect a variable dollar amount payment under the Payments for a Period Certain  
Settlement Option, but check with your qualified tax adviser because there may  
be adverse tax consequences.                                                    

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION -- There are certain restrictions on section 403(b)   
tax-sheltered annuities. As of December 31, 1988, all section 403(b) annuities  
have limits on full and partial Surrenders. Contributions to the Contract made  
after December 31, 1988 and any increases in cash value after December 31, 1988 
may not be distributed unless the Contract Owner/employee has a) attained age   
59 1/2, b) separated from service, c) died, d) become disabled or e) experienced
financial hardship (cash value increases may not be distributed for hardships   
prior to age 59 1/2). Distributions prior to age 59 1/2 due to financial        
hardship or separation from service may still be subject to a penalty tax of    
10%. We will not assume any responsibility for determining whether a surrender  
is permissible, with or without tax penalty, in any particular situation; or in 
monitoring Surrender requests regarding pre or post January 1, 1989 Contract    
Values. Any full or partial Surrender described above may affect the continuing 
tax-qualified status of some Contracts or plans and may result in adverse tax   
consequences to the Contract Owner. The Contract Owner, therefore, should       
consult with a tax adviser before undertaking any such Surrender. (See "Federal
Tax Considerations")                                                            

CONTRACT CHARGES                                                                
CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ("CDSC")                                       

The CDSC covers some of the expenses relating to the sale and distribution of   
the Contract, including commissions paid to registered representatives and the  
cost of preparing sales literature and other promotional activities.            

We may assess a CDSC when you request a full or partial Surrender. The CDSC is  
based on the amount you choose to Surrender and how long your Premium Payments  
have been in the Contract. Each Premium Payment has its own CDSC schedule.      
Premium Payments are Surrendered in the order in which they were received. The  
longer you leave your Premium Payments in the Contract, the lower the CDSC will 
be when you Surrender. The amount assessed a CDSC will not exceed your total    
Premium Payments.                                                               

The percentage used to calculate the CDSC is equal to:

For example, you made an initial Premium Payment of $10,000 five years ago and  
an additional Premium Payment of $20,000 one year ago. If you request a partial 
withdrawal of $15,000 and you have not taken your Annual Withdrawal Amount for  
the year, we will deduct a CDSC as follows.                                     

- Hartford will Surrender the Annual Withdrawal Amount which is equal to 15% of 
your total Premium Payments or $4,500 without charging a CDSC.              

- We will then Surrender the Premium Payments that have been in the Annuity the 
longest.                                                                    

- That means we would Surrender the entire $10,000 initial Premium Payment and  
deduct a CDSC of 4% on that amount or $400.00.                              

- The remaining $500 will come from the additional Premium Payment made one year
ago and we will deduct a CDSC of 7% of the $500 or $35.00.

If you have any questions about these charges, please contact your financial    
adviser or Hartford.                                                            

PAYMENTS NOT SUBJECT TO CDSC                                                    

ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT -- During the first seven Contract years, you may make 
a partial Surrender of Contract Values of up to 15% of the premium payments each
Contract Year on a non-cumulative basis, as determined on the date of the       
requested Surrender, without the application of the CDSC. After the seventh     
Contract Year, you may make a partial Surrender each Contract Year of 15% of    
premium payments made during the seven years prior to the Surrender and 100% of 
the Contract Value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior  
to the Surrender. These amounts are different for group unallocated Contracts   
and Contracts issued to a Charitable Remainder Trust.                           

EXTENDED SURRENDER PRIVILEGE -- This privilege allows Annuitants who attain age 
70 1/2 with a Contract held under an Individual Retirement Account or           
403(b) plan to Surrender an amount equal to the required minimum distribution   
for the stated Contract without incurring any CDSC.                             

WAIVERS OF CDSC                                                                 
CONFINEMENT IN A NURSING HOME, HOSPITAL OR LONG TERM CARE FACILITY (DESCRIBED AS
ELIGIBLE CONFINEMENT IN THE CONTRACT) -- We will waive any CDSC applicable to a 
partial or full Surrender if the Annuitant, Contract Owner or joint owner is    
confined, at the recommendation of a physician for medically necessary reasons, 
for at least 180 calendar days to: a hospital recognized as a general hospital  
by the proper authority of the state in which it is located; or a hospital      
recognized as a general hospital by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of
Hospitals; or a facility certified as a hospital or long-term care facility; or 
a nursing home licensed by the state in which it is located and offers the      
services of a registered nurse 24 hours a day.                                  

The Annuitant, Contract Owner, or joint owner cannot be confined at the time the
Contract is purchased in order to receive this waiver and the Contract Owner(s) 
must have been the Contract Owner(s) continuously since the Contract issue date.
You must provide written proof of confinement satisfactory to Hartford and you  
must request the partial or full Surrender within 91 calendar days of the last  
day of confinement.                                                             

This waiver may not be available in all states. Please contact your registered  
representative or contact Us to determine availability.                         

DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT OR CONTRACT OWNER OR PAYMENTS UNDER AN ANNUITY           
OPTION -- No CDSC otherwise applicable will be assessed in the event of death of
the Annuitant, death of the Contract Owner or if payments are made under an     
Annuity option (other than a Surrender of variable payments for a Period Certain
Annuity option) provided for under the Contract.                                

OTHER PLANS OR PROGRAMS -- Certain plans or programs established by us from time
to time may have different Surrender privileges.                                

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE -- For assuming risks under the Contract, We  
deduct a daily charge at the rate of 1.25% per year against all Contract Values 
held in the Accounts during the life of the Contract. Although variable annuity 
payments made under the Contracts will vary in accordance with the investment   
performance of the underlying Portfolio shares held in the Sub-Account(s), the  
payments will not be affected by (a) our actual mortality experience among      
Annuitants before or after the Annuity Commencement Date or (b) our actual      
expenses, if greater than the deductions provided for in the Contracts because  
of the expense and mortality undertakings by us.                                

There are two types of mortality risks: those made during the accumulation or   
deferral phase and those made during the annuity payout phase. The mortality    
risk we take in the accumulation phase is that we may experience a loss         
resulting from the assumption of the mortality risk relative to the death       
benefit in event of the death of an Annuitant or Contract Owner before          
commencement of Annuity payments, in periods of declining value. The mortality  
risk we take during the annuity payout phase is to make monthly Annuity payments
(determined in accordance with the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table and 
other provisions contained in the Contract) to Annuitants regardless of how long
an Annuitant may live, and regardless of how long all Annuitants as a group may 
live. These mortality undertakings are based on our determination of expected   
mortality rates among all Annuitants. If actual experience among Annuitants     
during the Annuity payment period deviates from our actuarial determination of  
expected mortality rates among Annuitants because, as a group, their longevity  
is longer than anticipated, we must provide amounts from our general funds to   
fulfill our contractual obligations. We will bear the loss in such a situation. 

During the accumulation phase, we also provide an expense undertaking. We assume
the risk that the Annual Maintenance Fee for maintaining the Contracts prior to 
the Annuity Commencement Date may be insufficient to cover the actual cost of   
providing such items.                                                           

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE -- Each year, on each Contract Anniversary on or before  
the Annuity Commencement Date, we will deduct an Annual Maintenance Fee, if     
applicable, from Contract Values to reimburse us for expenses relating to the   
maintenance of the Contract and Accounts. If during a Contract Year the Contract
is Surrendered for its full value, we will deduct the Annual Maintenance Fee at 
the time of such Surrender. The fee is a flat fee that will be due in the full  
amount regardless of the time of the Contract Year that Contract Values are     
Surrendered. The Annual Maintenance Fee is $30 per Contract Year for Contracts  
with less than $50,000 Contract Value on the Contract Anniversary. Fees will be 
deducted on a pro rata basis according to the value in each Account under a     
Contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WAIVERS OF THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE -- Annual Maintenance Fees are waived for 
Contracts with Contract Value equal to or greater than $50,000. In addition, we 
will waive one Annual Maintenance Fee for Contract Owners who own one or more   
Contracts with a combined Contract Value of $50,000 up to $100,000. If you have 
multiple Contracts with a combined Contract Value of $100,000 or greater, we    
will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee on all Contracts. However, we reserve the 
right to limit the number of Annual Maintenance Fee waivers to a total of six   
Contracts. We reserve the right to waive the Annual Maintenance Fee under other 
conditions.                                                                     

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE -- For administration, we apply a daily charge at the rate
of .15% per year against all Contract Values held in the Separate Account during
both the accumulation and annuity phases of the Contract. There is not          
necessarily a relationship between the amount of administrative charge imposed  
on a given Contract and the amount of expenses that may be attributable to that 
Contract; expenses may be more or less than the charge.                         

The types of expenses incurred by the Separate Account include, but are not     
limited to, expenses of issuing the Contract and expenses for confirmations,    
Contract quarterly statements, processing of transfers and surrenders,          
responding to Contract Owner inquiries, reconciling and depositing cash         
receipts, calculation and monitoring daily Sub-Account unit values, Separate    
Account reporting, including semiannual and annual reports and mailing and      
tabulation of shareholder proxy solicitations.                                  

You should refer to the Trust prospectus for a description of deductions and    
expenses paid out of the assets of the Trust's portfolios.                      

PREMIUM TAXES -- Charges are also deducted for Premium Tax, if applicable,      
imposed by state or other governmental entity. Certain states impose a Premium  
Tax, currently ranging up to 3.5%. Some states assess the tax at the time       
purchase payments are made; others assess the tax at the time of annuitization. 
We will pay Premium Taxes at the time imposed under applicable law. At our sole 
discretion, we may deduct Premium Taxes at the time we pay such taxes to the    
applicable taxing authorities, at the time the Contract is Surrendered, at the  
time a death benefit is paid, or at the time the Contract annuitizes.           

OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT FEE -- If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we will  
deduct daily from your Contract Value an additional charge which equals .15% per
year of the Sub-Account value.                                                  

EXCEPTIONS TO CHARGES UNDER THE CONTRACT -- We may offer, at our discretion,    
reduced fees and charges including, but not limited to, CDSC, the mortality and 
expense risk charge, administration charges, optional charges and the Annual    
Maintenance Fee for certain sales (including employer sponsored savings plans)  
under circumstances which may result in savings of certain costs and expenses.  
Reductions in these fees and charges will not be unfairly discriminatory against
any Contract Owner.                                                             

DEATH BENEFITS                                                                  
DEATH BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE                                      

DETERMINATION OF THE BENEFICIARY -- If the Contract Owner or the Annuitant dies 
before the Annuity Commencement Date, we will pay a Death Benefit to the        
Beneficiary.                                                                    

-  IF THE CONTRACT OWNER DIES before the Annuity Commencement Date, any       
surviving joint Contract Owner becomes the Beneficiary. If there is no  
surviving joint Contract Owner, the designated Beneficiary will be the  
Beneficiary. If the Contract Owner's spouse is the sole Beneficiary, the
  spouse may elect, in lieu of receiving the Death Benefit, to be treated as
the Contract Owner. If the Annuitant is not living and there is no      
Contingent Annuitant, the spouse will be presumed to be the Contingent  
   Annuitant. If no Beneficiary designation is in effect or if the Beneficiary
   has predeceased the Contract Owner, the Contract Owner's estate will be the
Beneficiary.                                                            

-  IF THE ANNUITANT DIES before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Contingent 
 Annuitant will become the Annuitant. If either (a) there is no Contingent
Annuitant, (b) the Contingent Annuitant predeceases the Annuitant, or   
 (c) if any sole Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date,
  the Beneficiary, as determined under the Contract control provisions, will
receive the Death Benefit. However, if the Annuitant dies prior to the  
Annuity Commencement Date and the Contract Owner is living, the Contract
  Owner shall be the Beneficiary. In that case, the rights of any designated
Beneficiary shall be void.                                              

DETERMINATION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT                                              

IF YOU DID NOT ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, Your Death Benefit, which we   
will calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be calculated 
as follows:                                                                     

If the deceased HAD NOT REACHED THEIR 81ST BIRTHDAY, the Death Benefit is the   
greater of:                                                                     

- 100% of the total premium payments made to the Contract, reduced by any       
subsequent Surrenders, or                                                   

- The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                        

- Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                     

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on Contract  
Anniversaries of Contract Values, premium payments and partial Surrenders. We   
will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary prior to the  
deceased's 81st birthday or date of death. The Anniversary Value is equal to the
Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by the dollar amount of  
any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by the dollar      
amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary. The Maximum Anniversary
Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value attained from this series of   
calculations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF THE DECEASED REACHED THEIR 81ST BIRTHDAY, then the Death Benefit is the      
greater of:                                                                     

- 100% of the total premium payments made to us, reduced by any subsequent      
Surrenders; or                                                              

- The Contract Value of your annuity; or                                        

- The Maximum Anniversary Value.                                                

IF YOU DID ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, the Death Benefit, which we will   
calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be the greater of: 

- 100% of the total premium payments made to us, reduced by any subsequent      
Surrenders;                                                                 

- The Contract Value of your annuity;                                           

- The Maximum Anniversary Value; or                                             

- The Interest Accumulation Value, which is described below.                    

The Interest Accumulation Value is calculated by accumulating interest on your  
premium payments at a rate of 5% per year up to the deceased's 81st birthday or 
date of death, assuming you have not taken any Surrenders. If you have taken any
Surrenders, the 5% will be accumulated on your premium payments, but there will 
be an adjustment for any of the Surrenders. This adjustment will reduce the     
Optional Death Benefit proportionally for the Surrenders. We stop compounding   
interest on the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death. After that date, the 
Interest Accumulation Value will be adjusted by adding any subsequent payments  
and subtracting proportional adjustments for any partial Surrenders. The        
Optional Death Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of premium payments, less
proportional adjustments for any Surrenders. For examples on how the Optional   
Death Benefit is calculated see "Appendix II". The Optional Death Benefit may   
not be available if the Contract Owner or Annuitant is age 75 or older. For     
Contracts issued in the state of Washington, the Optional Death Benefit is not  
available.                                                                      

If you elect to add the Optional Death Benefit after you purchase your annuity, 
the Interest Accumulation Value calculation will be:                            

- Your Contract Value on the date we add the Optional Death Benefit to your     
annuity;                                                                    

- Plus any Premium Payments made after the Optional Death Benefit is added;     

- Minus any partial Surrenders after the Optional Death Benefit is added;       

- Compounded daily at an annual interest rate of 5%.                            

SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If a Beneficiary is the Contract Owner's       
spouse, that portion of the Contract for which the spouse is considered the     
Beneficiary will continue with the spouse as Contract Owner, unless the spouse  
elects to receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment or as an annuity      
payment option. If the Contract continues with the spouse as Contract Owner, we 
will adjust the Contract Value to the amount that we would have paid as the     
Death Benefit payment, had the spouse elected to receive the Death Benefit as a 
lump sum payment. Spousal Contract Continuation will only apply one time for    
each Contract.                                                                  

CALCULATION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT -- If the Contract Owner or Annuitant dies     
before the Annuity Commencement Date and a Death Benefit is payable to the      
Beneficiary, the Death Benefit will be calculated as of the date we receive     
written notification of Due Proof of Death. THE DEATH BENEFIT REMAINS INVESTED  
IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO YOUR LAST INSTRUCTIONS UNTIL THE PROCEEDS  
ARE PAID OR WE RECEIVE NEW SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE BENEFICIARY. DURING 
THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN OUR RECEIPT OF WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF DUE PROOF OF     
DEATH AND OUR RECEIPT OF THE COMPLETE SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS, THE CALCULATED   
DEATH BENEFIT WILL BE SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. UPON RECEIPT OF COMPLETE  
SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS, WE WILL CALCULATE THE PAYABLE AMOUNT.                  

Any Annuity payments made on or after the date of death, but before receipt of  
written notification of Due Proof of Death will be recovered by us from the     
Payee.                                                                          

DEATH ON OR AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE                                 

If, on or after the Annuity Commencement Date, the Contract Owner dies and the  
Annuitant is living, the Beneficiary becomes the Contract Owner. If the         
Annuitant dies and the Contract Owner is living, the Contract Owner becomes the 
Beneficiary.                                                                    

If the Annuitant dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date, a Death Benefit
may be paid or payments may continue under the following annuity payment        
options:                                                                        

- Life Annuity with Cash Refund                                                 

- Life Annuity with payments for a Period Certain                               

- Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity with payments for a Period Certain and   

- Payments for a Period Certain.                                                

Proceeds from the Death Benefit may be left with us for at least 5 years from   
the date of the Contract Owner's death if the death occurs prior to the Annuity 
Commencement Date. These proceeds will remain in the Account(s) to which they   
were allocated at the time of death unless the Beneficiary elects to reallocate 
them. Full or partial Surrenders may be made at any time. In the event of a     
complete Surrender, the remaining value will equal the Contract Value of the    
proceeds left with us, minus any partial Surrenders. This option may not be     
available under certain Contracts issued in connection with Qualified Plans.

SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS                                                           

You select an Annuity Commencement Date which will not be deferred beyond the   
Valuation Day immediately following the later of the Annuitant's 90th birthday  
or the end of the tenth Contract Year. You may elect a later Annuity            
Commencement Date if we allow and subject to the laws and regulations then in   
effect. If the Contract is sold as part of a Charitable Remainder Trust, the    
Annuity Commencement Date may be deferred to the Annuitant's 100th birthday. The
Annuity Commencement Date may be changed from time to time, but ANY CHANGE MUST 
BE WITHIN 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH ANNUITY PAYMENTS ARE SCHEDULED TO  
BEGIN.                                                                          

You also elect in writing an annuity payment option, which may be any of the    
options described below or any annuity payment option then being offered by us. 
The annuity payment option may not be changed on or after the Annuity           
Commencement Date. The Contract contains the six annuity payment options        
described below and the Annuity Proceeds Settlement Option.                     

For Qualified Contracts, the following annuity payment options are only         
available if the guaranteed payment period is less than the life expectancy of  
the Annuitant at the time the option becomes effective. The Annuity Proceeds    
Settlement option is available for Qualified Contracts only if the guaranteed   
payment period is less than the life expectancy of the Beneficiary at the time  
the option becomes effective. Such life expectancies are computed on the basis  
of the mortality table prescribed by the IRS, or if none is prescribed, the     
mortality table in use by us. If you do not elect otherwise, fixed dollar amount
annuity payments will begin automatically on the Annuity Commencement Date,     
under the Life Annuity Payment Option.                                          

For Non-Qualified Contracts, if you do not elect otherwise, fixed dollar amount 
annuity payments will automatically begin on the Annuity Commencement Date under
the annuity payment option Life Annuity with payments for a Period Certain of 10
years. For Qualified Contracts and Contracts issued in Texas, if you do not     
elect otherwise, fixed dollar amount annuity payments will begin automatically  
on the Annuity Commencement Date, under the Life Annuity Payment Option.        

With the exception of the option Payments for a Period Certain, if the variable 
dollar amount payment is selected, no Surrenders are permitted after annuity    
payments begin.

   payments have started and we will give you the present value of the remaining
payments less any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.          

-  If the Annuitant dies prior to the end of the period selected, we will pay 
 your Beneficiary the present value of the remaining payments, either in a
 lump sum payment or we will continue payments until the end of the period
selected.                                                               

-  For Contracts issued in the state of Oregon, Payments for a Period Certain 
  may be selected as follows: For fixed annuity payments, the minimum period
   that you can select is 10 years at any time and 5 years on or after the 2nd
    Contract Anniversary. For variable annuity payments, the minimum period that
  you can select is 5 years on or after the 10th Contract Anniversary. Under
an Annuity payable with variable annuity payments, you may surrender the
 Contract after payments have begun by submitting a written request to us.
The amount available to you is the Commuted Value.                      

WE MAY OFFER OTHER ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME.                   
ANNUITY PAYMENTS                                                                

When your decide to begin to take payments, we calculate your Contract Value    
minus any Premium Tax which we must pay and, unless you instruct us otherwise,  
we apply that amount to a variable annuity with the same Sub-Account values. You
may however, choose to have your Contract Value applied to a fixed annuity      
instead.                                                                        

IMPORTANT: YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF ALLOCATION OF CONTRACT VALUES    
(LESS APPLICABLE PREMIUM TAXES) AMONG ACCOUNTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT ANNUITY     
PAYMENTS ARE BASED ON THE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE BEST SUITED TO YOUR NEEDS FOR  
RETIREMENT.                                                                     

ANNUITY PAYMENTS -- The minimum Annuity payment is $50. No election may be made 
which results in a first payment of less than $50. If at any time Annuity       
payments are or become less than $50, we have the right to change the frequency 
of payment to intervals so that payments will at least be $50. For Contracts    
issued in the State of New York, the minimum monthly Annuity payment is $20. If 
any amount due is less than the minimum amount per year, we make such other     
settlement as may be equitable to the Payee.                                    

All Annuity payments under any option will occur the same day of the month as   
the Annuity Commencement Date, based on the payment frequency selected by you.  
Available payment frequencies include monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and       
annual. The payment frequency may be changed within 30 days prior to the        
anniversary of your Annuity Commencement Date.                                  

ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You select the Annuity Commencement Date in your   
application or order request. The Annuity Calculation Date will be no more than 
five Valuation Days before the Annuity Commencement Date.                       

ANNUITY CALCULATION DATE -- On the Annuity Calculation Date, your Contract Value
less any applicable Premium Tax is applied to purchase Annuity Units of the     
Sub-Accounts selected by you. The first Annuity payment is computed using the   
value of these Annuity Units as of the Annuity Calculation Date.                

INCOME PAYMENT DATES -- All Annuity payments after the first Annuity payment are
computed and payable as of the Income Payment Dates. These dates are the same   
day of the month as the Annuity Commencement Date, based on the Annuity payment 
frequency selected by you. They are also shown on the specification page of your
Contract. You may choose from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual        
payments. The Annuity payment frequency may not be changed once selected by you.

IN THE EVENT THAT YOU DO NOT SELECT A PAYMENT FREQUENCY, ANNUITY PAYMENTS WILL  
BE MADE MONTHLY.                                                                
VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS                                                       

THE FIRST VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENT. -- Variable Annuity payments are periodic   
payments we pay to your designated Payee, the amount of which varies from one   
Income Payment Date to the next as a function of the net investment performance 
of the Sub-Accounts selected by you. The dollar amount of the first Variable    
Annuity payment depends on the annuity payment option chosen, the age of the    
Annuitant, the gender of the Annuitant (if applicable), the amount of Contract  
Value less applicable Premium Tax applied to purchase the Annuity payments, and 
the applicable annuity purchase rates based on the 1983a Individual Annuity     
Mortality table using projection scale G projected to the year 2000 and an AIR  
of not less than 3.0%.                                                          

The dollar amount of the first Variable Annuity payment attributable to each    
Sub-Account is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Contract Value   
less applicable Premium Tax applied to that Sub-Account on the Annuity          
Calculation Date by $1,000 and multiplying the result by the payment factor in  
the Contract for the selected annuity payment option. The dollar value of the   
first Variable Annuity payment is the sum of the first Variable Annuity payments
attributable to each Sub-Account.                                               

ANNUITY UNITS -- The number of Annuity Units attributable to a Sub-Account is   
derived by dividing the first Variable Annuity payment attributable to that     
Sub-Account by the Annuity Unit value for that Sub-Account for the Valuation    
Period ending on the Annuity Calculation Date or during which the Annuity       
Calculation Date falls if the Valuation Period does not end on such date. The   
number of Annuity Units attributable to each Sub-Account under a Contract       
remains fixed unless there is a transfer of Annuity Units between Sub-Accounts. 

SUBSEQUENT VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS -- The dollar amount of each subsequent    
Variable Annuity payment attributable to each Sub-Account is calculated on the  
Income Payment Date. It is determined by multiplying (a) by (b), where:         

- is the number of Annuity Units of each Sub-Account credited under the Contract
and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- is the Annuity Unit value (described below) for that Sub-Account.             

The total subsequent Variable Annuity payments equal the sum of the amounts     
attributable to each Sub-Account.                                               

When an Income Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Valuation Day, the     
Income Payment is computed as of the prior Valuation Day. If the date of the    
month elected does not occur in a given month, i.e., the 29th, 30th, or 31st of 
a month, the payment will be computed as of the last Valuation Day of the month.

The Annuity Unit value of each Sub-Account for any Valuation Period is equal to 
(a) multiplied by (b) multiplied by (c) where:                                  

- is the Net Investment Factor for the Valuation Period for which the Annuity   
Unit value is being calculated;                                             

- is the Annuity Unit value for the preceding Valuation Period; and             

- is the Annuity Unit Factor                                                    

The Annuity Unit Factor neutralizes the AIR percentage (3%, 5%, or 6%). The     
daily Annuity Unit Factor corresponding to the AIR percentages of 3%, 5%, and 6%
are 0.999919, 0.999866, and 0.999840, respectively.                             

THE ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN (AIR) -- The Annuity Unit value will increase or  
decrease from one Income Payment Date to the next in direct proportion to the   
net investment return of the Sub-Account(s) supporting the Variable Annuity     
payments, less an adjustment to neutralize the selected AIR. Dividing what would
otherwise be the Annuity Unit value by the AIR factor is necessary in order to  
adjust the change in the Annuity Unit value (resulting from the Net Investment  
Factor) so that the Annuity Unit value only changes to the extent that the Net  
Investment Factor represents a rate of return greater than or less than the AIR 
selected by you. Without this adjustment, the Net Investment Factor would       
decrease the Annuity Unit value to the extent that such value represented an    
annualized rate of return of less than 0.0% and increase the Annuity Unit value 
to the extent that such value represented an annualized rate of return of       
greater than 0.0%.                                                              

The Contract permits Contract Owners to select one of three AIRs: 3%, 5% or 6%. 
A higher AIR will result in a higher initial payment, a more slowly rising      
series of subsequent payments when actual investment performance (minus any     
deductions and expenses) exceeds the AIR, and a more rapid drop in subsequent   
payments when actual investment performance (minus any deductions and expenses) 
is less than the AIR. The 6% AIR is not available in the states of Oklahoma,    
Oregon, New Jersey or Texas. The following examples may help clarify the impact 
of selecting one AIR over another:                                              

- If you select a 3% AIR and if the net investment return of the Sub-Account for
  an Annuity payment period is equal to the pro-rated portion of the 3% AIR, the
  Variable Annuity payment attributable to that Sub-Account for that period will
equal the Annuity payment for the prior period. To the extent that such net 
investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of 3% for a payment  
period, the Annuity payment for that period will be greater than the Annuity
payment for the prior period and to the extent that such return for a period
falls short of an annualized rate of 3%, the Annuity payment for that period
will be less than the Annuity payment for the prior period.                 

- If you select a 5% AIR and if the net investment return of the Sub-Account for
  an Annuity payment period is equal to the pro-rated portion of the 5% AIR, the
  Variable Annuity payment attributable to that Sub-Account for that period will
equal the Annuity payment for the prior period. To the extent that such net 
investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of 5% for a payment  
period, the Annuity payment for that period will be greater than the Annuity
payment for the prior period and to the extent that such return for a period
falls short of an annualized rate of 5%, the Annuity payment for that period
will be less than the Annuity payment for the prior period.                 

- If you select a 6% AIR and if the net investment return of the Sub-Account for
  an Annuity payment period is equal to the pro-rated portion of the 6% AIR, the
  Variable Annuity payment attributable to that Sub-Account for that period will
equal the Annuity payment for the prior period. To the extent that such net 
investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of 6% for a payment  
period, the Annuity payment for that period will be greater than the Annuity
payment for the prior period and to the extent that such return for a period
falls short of an annualized rate of 6%, the Annuity payment for that period
will be less than the Annuity payment for the prior period.                 

LEVEL VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS WOULD BE PRODUCED IF THE INVESTMENT RATE RETURNS
REMAINED CONSTANT AND EQUAL TO THE AIR. IN FACT, PAYMENTS WILL VARY UP OR DOWN  
AS THE INVESTMENT RATE VARIES UP OR DOWN FROM THE AIR.                          

EXCHANGE (TRANSFER) OF ANNUITY UNITS -- After the Annuity Calculation Date, you 
may exchange (i.e., transfer) the dollar value of a designated number of Annuity
Units of a particular Sub-Account for an equivalent dollar amount of Annuity    
Units of another Sub-Account. On the date of the transfer, the dollar amount of 
a Variable Annuity payment generated from the Annuity Units of either           
Sub-Account would be the same. Transfers are executed as of the day Hartford    
receives a written request for a transfer. For guidelines refer to Sub-Account  
Value Transfers Before and After the Annuity Commencement Date.                 

FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY -- Fixed Annuity payments are determined at annuitization  
by multiplying the Contract Value (less applicable Premium Taxes) by a rate to  
be determined by Hartford which is no less than the rate specified in the Fixed 
Annuity option tables in the Contract. The Annuity payment will remain level for
the duration of the Annuity. Any Fixed Annuity allocation may not be changed.

OTHER INFORMATION                                                               

ASSIGNMENT -- Ownership of this Contract is generally assignable. However, if   
the Contracts are issued pursuant to some form of Qualified Plan, it is possible
that the ownership of the Contracts may not be transferred or assigned depending
on the type of tax-qualified retirement plan involved. An assignment of a       
Non-Qualified Contract may subject the Contract Values or assignment proceeds to
income taxes and certain penalty taxes.                                         

CONTRACT MODIFICATION -- The Annuitant may not be changed; however, the         
Contingent Annuitant may be changed at any time prior to the Annuity            
Commencement Date by sending us written notice. We may modify the Contract, but 
no modification will effect the amount or term of any Contract unless a         
modification is required to conform the Contract to applicable Federal or State 
law. No modification will effect the method by which Contract Values are        
determined.                                                                     

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some of the federal tax consequences which affect these Contracts?     

A.  GENERAL                                                                     

Since federal tax law is complex, the tax consequences of purchasing this       
contract will vary depending on your situation. You may need tax or legal advice
to help you determine whether purchasing this contract is right for you.        

Our general discussion of the tax treatment of this contract is based on our    
understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted. A   
detailed description of all federal income tax consequences regarding the       
purchase of this contract cannot be made in the prospectus. We also do not      
discuss state, municipal or other tax laws that may apply to this contract. For 
detailed information, you should consult with a qualified tax adviser familiar  
with your situation.                                                            

B.  TAXATION OF HARTFORD AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT                               

The Separate Account is taxed as part of Hartford which is taxed as a life      
insurance company in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as      
amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, the Separate Account will not be taxed as a  
"regulated investment company" under subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.     
Investment income and any realized capital gains on the assets of the Separate  
Account are reinvested and are taken into account in determining the value of   
the Accumulation and Annuity Units (See "Value of Accumulation Units"). As a    
result, such investment income and realized capital gains are automatically     
applied to increase reserves under the Contract.                                

No taxes are due on interest, dividends and short-term or long-term capital     
gains earned by the Separate Account with respect to Qualified or Non-Qualified 
Contracts.                                                                      

C.  TAXATION OF ANNUITIES -- GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING PURCHASERS OTHER THAN 
QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS                                                      

Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities in general.            

1. NON-NATURAL PERSONS, CORPORATIONS, ETC.                                    

Code Section 72 contains provisions for contract owners which are not natural   
persons. Non-natural persons include corporations, trusts, limited liability    
companies, partnerships and other types of legal entities. The tax rules for    
contracts owned by non-natural persons are different from the rules for         
contracts owned by individuals. For example, the annual net increase in the     
value of the contract is currently includible in the gross income of a          
non-natural person, unless the non-natural person holds the contract as an agent
for a natural person. There are additional exceptions from current inclusion    
for:                                                                            

- certain annuities held by structured settlement companies,                    

- certain annuities held by an employer with respect to a terminated qualified  
retirement plan and                                                         

- certain immediate annuities.                                                  

A non-natural person which is a tax-exempt entity for federal tax purposes will 
not be subject to income tax as a result of this provision.                     

If the contract owner is a non-natural person, the primary annuitant is treated 
as the contract owner in applying mandatory distribution rules. These rules     
require that certain distributions be made upon the death of the contract owner.
A change in the primary annuitant is also treated as the death of the contract  
owner.                                                                          

2. OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS (NATURAL PERSONS).                                   

A Contract Owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the Contract until an
amount is received or deemed received, e.g., in the form of a lump sum payment  
(full or partial value of a Contract) or as Annuity payments under the          
settlement option elected.                                                      

The provisions of Section 72 of the Code concerning distributions are summarized
briefly below. Also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from   
Contracts obtained in a tax-free exchange for other annuity contracts or life   
insurance contracts which were purchased prior to August 14, 1982.              

a. DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.                

i. Total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in
     gross income equal the "investment in the contract" under Section 72 of the
Code.                                                                 

ii. To the extent that the value of the Contract (ignoring any surrender      
charges except on a full surrender) exceeds the "investment in the    
contract," such excess constitutes the "income on the contract."      

P-->485BPOS35th Page of 98TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 35th
HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                   31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

iii. Any amount received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement 
  Date (e.g., upon a partial surrender) is deemed to come first from any
     such "income on the contract" and then from "investment in the contract,"
     and for these purposes such "income on the contract" shall be computed by
      reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph 2.c. below. As a result,
  any such amount received or deemed received (1) shall be includable in
gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such
     "income on the contract," and (2) shall not be includable in gross income
to the extent that such amount does exceed any such "income on the  
    contract." If at the time that any amount is received or deemed received
      there is no "income on the contract" (e.g., because the gross value of the
Contract does not exceed the "investment in the contract" and no    
   aggregation rule applies), then such amount received or deemed received
will not be includable in gross income, and will simply reduce the  
"investment in the contract."                                       

 iv. The receipt of any amount as a loan under the Contract or the assignment or
   pledge of any portion of the value of the Contract shall be treated as an
amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a. and the next     
subparagraph b.                                                       

v. In general, the transfer of the Contract, without full and adequate        
 consideration, will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this
subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b. This transfer rule does not
    apply, however, to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident
to divorce.                                                             

b. DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.                       

Annuity payments made periodically after the Annuity Commencement Date are      
includable in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount         
determined by the application of the ratio of the "investment in the contract"  
to the total amount of the payments to be made after the Annuity Commencement   
Date (the "exclusion ratio").                                                   

i. When the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the     
exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the  
   Annuity Commencement Date, any additional payments (including surrenders)
will be entirely includable in gross income.                          

ii. If the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the Annuitant and,
     as of the date of death, the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross
income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the   
     contract as of the Annuity Commencement Date, then the remaining portion of
     unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable
year of the Annuitant.                                                

iii. Generally, nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the     
 Annuity Commencement Date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and
     shall be fully includable in gross income. However, upon a full surrender
after such date, only the excess of the amount received (after any  
      surrender charge) over the remaining "investment in the contract" shall be
 includable in gross income (except to the extent that the aggregation
rule referred to in the next subparagraph c. may apply).            

c. AGGREGATION OF TWO OR MORE ANNUITY CONTRACTS.                        

Contracts issued after October 21, 1988 by the same insurer (or affiliated      
insurer) to the same Contract Owner within the same calendar year (other than   
certain contracts held in connection with a tax-qualified retirement            
arrangement) will be treated as one annuity Contract for the purpose of         
determining the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement     
Date. An annuity contract received in a tax-free exchange for another annuity   
contract or life insurance contract may be treated as a new Contract for this   
purpose. Hartford believes that for any annuity subject to such aggregation, the
values under the Contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added    
together to determine the taxation under subparagraph 2.a., above, of amounts   
received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Withdrawals 
will first be treated as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all 
such Contracts is withdrawn. As of the date of this Prospectus, there are no    
regulations interpreting this provision.                                        

d. 10% PENALTY TAX -- APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN WITHDRAWALS AND ANNUITY     
PAYMENTS.                                                         

i. If any amount is received or deemed received on the Contract (before or  
    after the Annuity Commencement Date), the Code applies a penalty tax equal
 to ten percent of the portion of the amount includable in gross income,
unless an exception applies.                                          

ii. The 10% penalty tax will not apply to the following distributions         
(exceptions vary based upon the precise plan involved):               

  1.  Distributions made on or after the date the recipient has attained the
age of 59 1/2.                                                  

2.  Distributions made on or after the death of the holder or where the 
holder is not an individual, the death of the primary annuitant.

3.  Distributions attributable to a recipient's becoming disabled.      

    4.  A distribution that is part of a scheduled series of substantially equal
      periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) for the life (or
life expectancy) of the recipient (or the joint lives or life   
expectancies of the recipient and the recipient's designated    
Beneficiary).                                                   

  5.  Distributions of amounts which are allocable to the "investment in the
contract" prior to August 14, 1982 (see next subparagraph e.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

e. SPECIAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING CONTRACTS OBTAINED THROUGH A TAX-FREE   
      EXCHANGE OF OTHER ANNUITY OR LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS PURCHASED PRIOR TO
AUGUST 14, 1982.                                                  

If the Contract was obtained by a tax-free exchange of a life insurance or      
annuity Contract purchased prior to August 14, 1982, then any amount received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date shall be deemed to come  
(1) first from the amount of the "investment in the contract" prior to August   
14, 1982 ("pre-8/14/82 investment") carried over from the prior Contract, (2)   
then from the portion of the "income on the contract" (carried over to, as well 
as accumulating in, the successor Contract) that is attributable to such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, (3) then from the remaining "income on the contract" and
(4) last from the remaining "investment in the contract." As a result, to the   
extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, such amount is not includable in gross income., In      
addition, to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not   
exceed the sum of (a) such pre-8/14/82 investment and (b) the "income on the    
contract" attributable thereto, such amount is not subject to the 10% penalty   
tax. In all other respects, amounts received or deemed received from such post- 
exchange Contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this         
subparagraph 3.                                                                 

f. REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS                                               

i. Death of Contract Owner or Primary Annuitant                             
  Subject to the alternative election or spouse beneficiary provisions in ii
or iii below:                                                           

     1. If any Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date and
    before the entire interest in the Contract has been distributed, the
   remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as
        rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of
such death;                                                     

 2. If any Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date, the
        entire interest in the Contract will be distributed within 5 years after
such death; and                                                 

   3. If the Contract Owner is not an individual, then for purposes of 1. or
      2. above, the primary annuitant under the Contract shall be treated as
    the Contract Owner, and any change in the primary annuitant shall be
        treated as the death of the Contract Owner. The primary annuitant is the
       individual, the events in the life of whom are of primary importance in
affecting the timing or amount of the payout under the Contract.

ii. Alternative Election to Satisfy Distribution Requirements                 
   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner described in i. above is
   payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, such beneficiary
    may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that does not extend
beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary. Distribution must
begin within a year of the Contract Owner's death.                      

iii. Spouse Beneficiary                                                       
   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner is payable to or for the
  benefit of his or her spouse, and the Annuitant or Contingent Annuitant is
  living, such spouse shall be treated as the Contract Owner of such portion
    for purposes of section i. above. This spousal continuation shall apply only
once for this contract.                                                 

3. DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.                                              

The Code requires that investments supporting your contract be adequately       
diversified. Code Section 817 provides that a variable annuity contract will not
be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments   
made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified. 
If a contract is not treated as an annuity contract, the contract owner will be 
subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value.                        

The Treasury Department's diversification regulations require, among other      
things, that:                                                                   

- no more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset     
account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment,

- no more than 70% is represented by any two investments,                       

- no more than 80% is represented by any three investments and                  

- no more than 90% is represented by any four investments.                      

In determining whether the diversification standards are met, all securities of 
the same issuer, all interests in the same real property project, and all       
interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment. In the 
case of government securities, each government agency or instrumentality is     
treated as a separate issuer.                                                   

A separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on  
the last day of each calendar quarter or within 30 days after the quarter ends. 
If an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification         
requirements, the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid 
the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis. However, either the company
or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which 
the diversification requirements were not met.                                  

We monitor the diversification of investments in the separate accounts and test 
for diversification as required by the Code. We intend to administer all        
contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will     
maintain adequate diversification.                                              

4. OWNERSHIP OF THE ASSETS IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT.                           

In order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral, assets in 
the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by 
the insurance company and not by the contract owner. It is unclear under what   
circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets  
in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes. 

The IRS has issued several rulings discussing investor control. These rulings   
say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner, such as the      
ability to select and control investments in a separate account, will cause the 
contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes.       

In its explanation of the diversification regulations, the Treasury Department  
recognized that the temporary regulations "do not provide guidance concerning   
the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated  
asset account may cause the investor, rather than the insurance company, to be  
treated as the owner of the assets in the account." The explanation further     
indicates that "the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a   
segregated asset account may include multiple sub-accounts, but do not specify  
the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular    
sub-accounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets.      
Guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue    
rulings under Section 817(d), relating to the definition of variable contract." 

The final regulations issued under Section 817 did not provide guidance         
regarding investor control, and as of the date of this prospectus, guidance has 
yet to be issued. We do not know if additional guidance will be issued. If      
guidance is issued, we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect.        

Due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control, there is some         
uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets   
for tax purposes. We reserve the right to modify the contract, as necessary, to 
prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account.  

D.  FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING                                              

Any portion of a distribution that is (or is deemed to be) current taxable      
income to the Contract Owner will be subject to federal income tax withholding  
and reporting under the Code. Generally, however, a Contract Owner may elect not
to have income taxes withheld or to have income taxes withheld at a different   
rate by filing a completed election form with us. Election forms will be        
provided at the time distributions are requested.                               

E.  GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS                     

The Contract may be used for a number of qualified retirement plans. If the     
Contract is being purchased with respect to some form of qualified retirement   
plan, please refer to Appendix I for information relative to the types of plans 
for which it may be used and the general explanation of the tax features of such
plans.                                                                          

F.  ANNUITY PURCHASES BY NONRESIDENT ALIENS AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS            

The discussion above provides general information regarding U.S. federal income 
tax consequences to annuity purchasers that are U.S. citizens or residents.     
Purchasers that are not U.S. citizens or residents will generally be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax and withholding on annuity distributions at a 30% rate, 
unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, purchasers may be subject to   
state premium tax, other state and/or municipal taxes, and taxes that may be    
imposed by the purchaser's country of citizenship or residence. Prospective     
purchasers are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser regarding U.S.,  
state, and foreign taxation with respect to an annuity purchase.                

G.  GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFERS                                               

Under certain circumstances, the Internal Revenue Code may impose a             
"generation-skipping transfer tax" when all or part of an annuity is transferred
to, or a death benefit is paid to, an individual two or more generations younger
than the owner. Federal tax law may require us to deduct the tax from your      
contract, or from any applicable payment, and pay it directly to the Internal   
Revenue Service.                                                                

MISCELLANEOUS                                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW CONTRACTS ARE SOLD                                                          

Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") serves as Principal      
Underwriter for the securities issued with respect to the Separate Account. HSD 
is an affiliate of Hartford. Both HSD and Hartford are ultimately controlled by 
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. The principal business address of   
HSD is the same as that of Hartford.                                            

The securities will be sold by insurance and variable annuity agents of Hartford
who are registered representatives of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ("Dean Witter").
Dean Witter is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National Association of       
Securities Dealers, Inc.                                                        

HSD is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities    
Dealers, Inc.                                                                   

Commissions will be paid by Hartford and will not be more than 7% of premium    
payments. From time to time, Hartford may pay or permit other promotional       
incentives, in cash or credit or other compensation.                            

Broker-dealers or financial institutions are compensated according to a schedule
set forth by HSD and any applicable rules or regulations for variable insurance 
compensation. Compensation is generally based on premium payments made by       
policyholders or contract owners. This compensation is usually paid from the    
sales charges described in this Prospectus.                                     

In addition, a broker-dealer or financial institution may also receive          
additional compensation for, among other things, training,

marketing or other services provided. HSD, its affiliates or Hartford may also  
make compensation arrangements with certain broker-dealers or financial         
institutions based on total sales by the broker-dealer or financial institution 
of insurance products. These payments, which may be different for different     
broker-dealers or financial institutions, will be made by HSD, its affiliates or
Hartford out of their own assets and will not effect the amounts paid by the    
policyholders or contract owners to purchase, hold or Surrender variable        
insurance products.                                                             

The Contract may be sold directly to certain individuals under certain          
circumstances that do not involve payment of any sales compensation to a        
registered representative. In such case, Hartford will credit the contract with 
an additional 5.0% of the Premium Payment. This additional percentage of Premium
Payment in no way affects present or future charges, rights, benefits or current
values of other Contract Owners. The following class of individuals are eligible
for this feature: (1) current or retired officers, directors, trustees and      
employees (and their families) of the ultimate parent and affiliates of         
Hartford; and (2) employees and registered representatives (and their families) 
of registered broker-dealers (and their financial institutions) that have a     
sales agreement with Hartford and its principal underwriter to sell the         
Contracts.                                                                      

LEGAL MATTERS                                                                   

There are no material legal proceedings pending to which the Separate Account is
a party.                                                                        

Counsel with respect to federal laws and regulations applicable to the issue and
sale of the Contracts and with respect to Connecticut law is Lynda Godkin,      
Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Hartford Life   
and Annuity Insurance Company, P.O. Box 2999, Hartford, Connecticut 06104-2999.

APPENDIX I -- INFORMATION REGARDING TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS              

This summary does not attempt to provide more than general information about the
federal income tax rules associated with use of a Contract by a tax-qualified   
retirement plan. Because of the complexity of the federal tax rules, owners,    
participants and beneficiaries are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors 
as to specific tax consequences.                                                

The federal tax rules applicable to owners of Contracts under tax-qualified     
retirement plans vary according to the type of plan as well as the terms and    
conditions of the plan itself. Contract owners, plan participants and           
beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights and benefits of any person may be   
controlled by the terms and conditions of the tax-qualified retirement plan     
itself, regardless of the terms and conditions of a Contract. We are not bound  
by the terms and conditions of such plans to the extent such terms conflict with
a Contract, unless we specifically consent to be bound.                         

Some tax-qualified retirement plans are subject to distribution and other       
requirements that are not incorporated into our administrative procedures.      
Contract owners, participants and beneficiaries are responsible for determining 
that contributions, distributions and other transactions comply with applicable 
law. Tax penalties may apply to transactions with respect to tax-qualified      
retirement plans if applicable federal income tax rules and restrictions are not
carefully observed.                                                             

We do not currently offer the Contracts in connection with all of the types of  
tax-qualified retirement plans discussed below and may not offer the Contracts  
for all types of tax-qualified retirement plans in the future.                  

1. TAX-QUALIFIED PENSION OR PROFIT-SHARING PLANS -- Eligible employers can      
establish certain tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans under section  
401 of the Code. Rules under section 401(k) of the Code govern certain "cash or 
deferred arrangements" under such plans. Rules under section 408(k) govern      
"simplified employee pensions". Tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans  
are subject to limitations on the amount that may be contributed, the persons   
who may be eligible to participate and the time when distributions must         
commence. Employers intending to use the Contracts in connection with           
tax-qualified pension or profit-sharing plans should seek competent tax and     
other legal advice.                                                             

2. TAX SHELTERED ANNUITIES UNDER SECTION 403(b) -- Public schools and certain   
types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations, as specified in  
section 501(c)(3) of the Code, can purchase tax-sheltered annuity contracts for 
their employees. Tax-deferred contributions can be made to tax-sheltered annuity
contracts under section 403(b) of the Code, subject to certain limitations.     
Generally, such contributions may not exceed the lesser of $10,500 (indexed) or 
20% of the employee's "includable compensation" for such employee's most recent 
full year of employment, subject to other adjustments. Special provisions under 
the Code may allow some employees to elect a different overall limitation.      

Tax-sheltered annuity programs under section 403(b) are subject to a PROHIBITION
AGAINST DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONTRIBUTIONS MADE      
PURSUANT TO A SALARY REDUCTION AGREEMENT, unless such distribution is made:     

- after the participating employee attains age 59 1/2;                          

- upon separation from service;                                                 

- upon death or disability; or                                                  

- in the case of hardship (and in the case of hardship, any income attributable 
to such contributions may not be distributed).                              

Generally, the above restrictions do not apply to distributions attributable to 
cash values or other amounts held under a section 403(b) contract as of         
December 31, 1988.                                                              

3.  DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER SECTION 457 -- A governmental employer or 
a tax-exempt employer other than a governmental unit can establish a Deferred   
Compensation Plan under section 457 of the Code. For these purposes, a          
"governmental employer" is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an   
agency or an instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State.    
Employees and independent contractors performing services for a governmental or 
tax-exempt employer can elect to have contributions made to a Deferred          
Compensation Plan of their employer in accordance with the employer's plan and  
section 457 of the Code.                                                        

Deferred Compensation Plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the 
Code are called "eligible" Deferred Compensation Plans. Section 457(b) limits   
the amount of contributions that can be made to an eligible Deferred            
Compensation Plan on behalf of a participant. Generally, the limitation on      
contributions is 33 1/3% of a participant's includable compensation (typically  
25% of gross compensation) or, for 2000, $8,000 (indexed), whichever is less.   
The plan may provide for additional "catch-up" contributions during the three   
taxable years ending before the year in which the participant attains normal    
retirement age.                                                                 

All of the assets and income of an eligible Deferred Compensation Plan of a     
governmental employer must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of        
participants and their beneficiaries. For this purpose, custodial accounts and  
certain annuity contracts are treated as trusts. The requirement of a trust does
not apply to amounts under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a tax-exempt         
(non-governmental) employer. In addition, the requirement of a trust does not   
apply to amounts under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a governmental employer  
if the Deferred Compensation Plan is not an eligible plan within the meaning of 
section 457(b) of the Code. In the absence of such a trust,

amounts under the plan will be subject to the claims of the employer's general  
creditors.                                                                      

In general, distributions from an eligible Deferred Compensation Plan are       
prohibited under section 457 of the Code unless made after the participating    
employee:                                                                       

- attains age 70 1/2,                                                           

- separates from service,                                                       

- dies, or                                                                      

- suffers an unforeseeable financial emergency as defined in the Code.          

Under present federal tax law, amounts accumulated in a Deferred Compensation   
Plan under section 457 of the Code cannot be transferred or rolled over on a    
tax-deferred basis except for certain transfers to other Deferred Compensation  
Plans under section 457 in limited cases.                                       

4. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES ("IRAS") UNDER SECTION 408                   

TRADITIONAL IRAS -- Eligible individuals can establish individual retirement    
programs under section 408 of the Code through the purchase of an IRA. Section  
408 imposes limits with respect to IRAs, including limits on the amount that may
be contributed to an IRA, the amount of such contributions that may be deducted 
from taxable income, the persons who may be eligible to contribute to an IRA,   
and the time when distributions commence from an IRA. Distributions from certain
tax-qualified retirement plans may be "rolled-over" to an IRA on a tax-deferred 
basis.                                                                          

SIMPLE IRAS -- Eligible employees may establish SIMPLE IRAs in connection with a
SIMPLE IRA plan of an employer under section 408(p) of the Code. Special        
rollover rules apply to SIMPLE IRAs. Amounts can be rolled over from one SIMPLE 
IRA to another SIMPLE IRA. However, amounts can be rolled over from a SIMPLE IRA
to a Traditional IRA only after two years have expired since the employee first 
commenced participation in the employer's SIMPLE IRA plan. Amounts cannot be    
rolled over to a SIMPLE IRA from a qualified plan or a Traditional IRA. Hartford
is a non-designated financial institution for purposes of the SIMPLE IRA rules. 

ROTH IRAS -- Eligible individuals may establish Roth IRAs under section 408A of 
the Code. Contributions to a Roth IRA are not deductible. Subject to special    
limitations, a Traditional IRA may be converted into a Roth IRA or a            
distribution from a Traditional IRA may be rolled over to a Roth IRA. However, a
conversion or a rollover from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is not excludable 
from gross income. If certain conditions are met, qualified distributions from a
Roth IRA are tax-free.                                                          

5. FEDERAL TAX PENALTIES AND WITHHOLDING -- Distributions from tax-qualified    
retirement plans are generally taxed as ordinary income under section 72 of the 
Code. Under these rules, a portion of each distribution may be excludable from  
income. The excludable amount is the portion of the distribution that bears the 
same ratio as the after-tax contributions bear to the expected return.          

(a) PENALTY TAX ON EARLY DISTRIBUTIONS  Section 72(t) of the Code imposes an    
    additional penalty tax equal to 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution
 from certain tax-qualified retirement plans. However, the 10% penalty tax
does not apply to a distributions that is:                              

- Made on or after the date on which the employee reaches age 59 1/2;           

- Made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the employee) on or after the death
of the employee;                                                            

- Attributable to the employee's becoming disabled (as defined in the Code);    

- Part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the employee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the employee and his or her     
designated beneficiary;                                                     

- Except in the case of an IRA, made to an employee after separation from       
service after reaching age 55; or                                           

- Not greater than the amount allowable as a deduction to the employee for      
eligible medical expenses during the taxable year.                          

IN ADDITION, THE 10% PENALTY TAX DOES NOT APPLY TO A DISTRIBUTION FROM AN IRA   
THAT IS:                                                                        

- Made after separation from employment to an unemployed IRA owner for health   
insurance premiums, if certain conditions are met;                          

- Not in excess of the amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses,  
as defined by section 72(t)(7) of the Code; or                              

- A qualified first-time homebuyer distribution meeting the requirements        
specified at section 72(t)(8) of the Code.                                  

If you are a participant in a SIMPLE IRA plan, you should be aware that the 10% 
penalty tax is increased to 25% with respect to non-exempt early distributions  
made from your SIMPLE IRA during the first two years following the date you     
first commenced participation in any SIMPLE IRA plan of your employer.          

(b) MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX  If the amount distributed is less than the
   minimum required distribution for the year, the Participant is subject to a
50% penalty tax on the amount that was not properly distributed.        

An individual's interest in a tax-qualified retirement plan generally must be   
distributed, or begin to be distributed, not later than the Required Beginning  
Date. Generally, the Required Beginning Date is April 1 of the calendar year    
following the later of:                                                         

- the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70 1/2; or              

- the calendar year in which the individual retires from service with the       
employer sponsoring the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Required Beginning Date for an individual who is a five (5) percent owner   
(as defined in the Code), or who is the owner of an IRA, is April 1 of the      
calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual attains age   
70 1/2.                                                                         

The entire interest of the Participant must be distributed beginning no later   
than the Required Beginning Date over:                                          

- the life of the Participant or the lives of the Participant and the           
Participant's designated beneficiary, or                                    

- over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Participant or  
 the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's designated
beneficiary.                                                                

Each annual distribution must equal or exceed a "minimum distribution amount"   
which is determined by dividing the account balance by the applicable life      
expectancy. This account balance is generally based upon the account value as of
the close of business on the last day of the previous calendar year. In         
addition, minimum distribution incidental benefit rules may require a larger    
annual distribution.                                                            

If an individual dies before reaching his or her Required Beginning Date, the   
individual's entire interest must generally be distributed within five years of 
the individual's death. However, this rule will be deemed satisfied, if         
distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the         
individual's death to a designated beneficiary and distribution is over the life
of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life  
expectancy of the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is the individual's surviving
spouse, distributions may be delayed until the individual would have attained   
age 70 1/2.                                                                     

If an individual dies after reaching his or her Required Beginning Date or after
distributions have commenced, the individual's interest must generally be       
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at
the time of the individual's death.                                             

(c) WITHHOLDING  In general, regular wage withholding rules apply to            
distributions from IRAs and plans described in section 457 of the Code. 
 Periodic distributions from other tax-qualified retirement plans that are
made for a specified period of 10 or more years or for the life or life 
 expectancy of the participant (or the joint lives or life expectancies of
    the participant and beneficiary) are generally subject to federal income tax
   withholding as if the recipient were married claiming three exemptions. The
recipient of periodic distributions may generally elect not to have     
 withholding apply or to have income taxes withheld at a different rate by
providing a completed election form.                                    

Mandatory federal income tax withholding at a flat rate of 20% will generally   
apply to other distributions from such other tax-qualified retirement plans     
unless such distributions are:                                                  

- the non-taxable portion of the distribution;                                  

- required minimum distributions; or                                            

- direct transfer distributions.                                                

Direct transfer distributions are direct payments to an IRA or to another       
eligible retirement plan under Code section 401(a)(31).                         

Certain states require withholding of state taxes when federal income tax is    
withheld.

redemptions of Fund shares held in each of the Sub-Accounts.                    

INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The audited financial statements included in this registration statement have   
been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, as

 DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTS

Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") serves as Principal      
Underwriter for the securities issued with respect to the Separate Account. HSD 
is an affiliate of Hartford. Both HSD and Hartford are ultimately controlled by 
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. The principal business address of   
HSD is the same as that of Hartford.                                            

The securities will be sold by insurance and variable annuity agents of Hartford
who are registered representatives of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ("Dean Witter").
Dean Witter is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National Association of       
Securities Dealers, Inc.                                                        

HSD is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities    
Dealers, Inc.                                                                   

Commissions will be paid by Hartford and will not be more than 7% of premium    
payments. From time to time, Hartford may pay or permit other promotional       
incentives, in cash or credit or other compensation.                            

Broker-dealers or financial institutions are compensated according to a schedule
set forth by HSD and any applicable rules or regulations for variable insurance 
compensation. Compensation is generally based on premium payments made by       
policyholders or contract owners. This compensation is usually paid from the    
sales charges described in the prospectus.                                      

In addition, a broker-dealer or financial institution may also receive          
additional compensation for, among other things, training, marketing or other   
services provided. HSD, its affiliates or Hartford may also make compensation   
arrangements with certain broker-dealers or financial institutions based on     
total sales by the broker-dealer or financial institution of insurance products.
These payments, which may be different for different broker-dealers or financial
institutions, will be made by HSD, its affiliates or Hartford out of their own  
assets and will not effect the amounts paid by the policyholders or contract    
owners to purchase, hold or Surrender variable insurance products.              

Hartford currently pays HSD underwriting commissions for its role as Principal  
Underwriter of all variable annuities associated with this Separate Account. For
the past three years, the aggregate dollar amount of underwriting commissions   
paid to HSD in its role as Principal Underwriter has been: 1999: $23,726,654.71;
1998: $11,655,729 and 1997: $17,944,107. HSD has retained none of these         
commissions.                                                                    

 CALCULATION OF YIELD AND RETURN

YIELD OF A MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT. As summarized in the prospectus under the  
heading "Performance Related Information," the yield of a Money Market          
Sub-Account                                                                     

P-->485BPOS51st Page of 98TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 51st
for a seven day period (the "base period") will be computed by determining the  
"net change in value" of a hypothetical account having a balance of one unit at 
the beginning of the period, dividing the net change in account value by the    
value of the account at the beginning of the base period to obtain the base     
period return, and multiplying the base period return by 365/7 with the         
resulting yield figure carried to the nearest hundredth of one percent. Net     
changes in value of a hypothetical account will include net investment income of
the account (accrued dividends as declared by the underlying funds, less expense
and Contract charges of the account) for the period, but will not include       
realized gains or losses or unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the      
underlying fund shares.                                                         

The effective yield is calculated by compounding the base period return by      
adding 1, raising the sum to a power equal to 365/7 and subtracting 1 from the  
result, according to the following formula:                                     

                       365/7
Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)      ] - 1                

A MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT'S YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD WILL VARY IN RESPONSE TO 
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND IN THE EXPENSES OF THE SUB-ACCOUNT. THE      
CURRENT YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD REFLECT RECURRING CHARGES ON THE SEPARATE     
ACCOUNT LEVEL, INCLUDING THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE.                    
YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD FOR THE SEVEN DAY PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1999.

YIELD OF SUB-ACCOUNTS. As summarized in the prospectus under the heading        
"Performance Related Information," yields of Sub-Accounts will be computed by   
annualizing a recent month's net investment income, divided by a Fund share's   
net asset value on the last trading day of that month. Net changes in the value 
of a hypothetical account will assume the change in the underlying mutual fund's
"net asset value per share" for the same period in addition to the daily expense
charge assessed, at the sub-account level for the respective period. The        
Sub-Accounts' yields will vary from time to time depending upon market          
conditions and, the composition of the underlying funds' portfolios. Yield      
should also be considered relative to changes in the value of the Sub-Accounts' 
shares and to the relative risks associated with the investment objectives and  
policies of the underlying Fund.                                                

THE YIELD REFLECTS RECURRING CHARGES ON THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT LEVEL, INCLUDING   
THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE.                                                     

Yield calculations of the Sub-Accounts used for illustration purposes reflect   
the interest earned by the Sub-Accounts, less applicable asset charges assessed 
against a

Contract Owner's account over the base period. Yield quotations based on a      
30-day period were computed by dividing the dividends and interest earned during
the period by the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period,
according to the following formula:                                             

Example:                                                                        

Current Yield Formula for the Sub-Account  2[((A-B)/(CD) + 1)                   
                            TO THE POWER OF 6 - 1]

Where         A = Dividends and interest earned during the period.              
        B = Expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).
        C = The average daily number of units outstanding during the
   period that were entitled to receive dividends.
          D = The maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the
period.

(1) Closed to new investments or transfers of existing contract values.         

At any time in the future, yields and total return may be higher or lower than  
past yields and there can be no assurance that any historical results will      
continue.                                                                       

CALCULATION OF TOTAL RETURN. As summarized in the prospectus under the heading  
"Performance Related Information", total return is a measure of the change in   
value of an investment in a Sub-Account over the period covered and assumes that
the Optional Death Benefit has not been elected. The formula for total return   
used herein includes three steps: (1) calculating the value of the hypothetical 
initial investment of $1,000 as of the end of the period by multiplying the     
total number of units owned at the end of the period by the unit value per unit 
on the last trading day of the period; (2) assuming redemption at the end of the
period and deducting any applicable contingent deferred sales charge and (3)    
dividing this account value for the hypothetical investor by the initial $1,000 
investment and annualizing the result for periods of less than one year.        
Standardized total return will be calculated since the inception of the Separate
Account for one year, five years, and ten years or some other relevant periods  
if a Sub-Account has not been in existence for at least ten years.              

The following are the standardized average annual total return quotations for   
the Sub-

Performance figures above do not reflect any deductions for Optional Death      
Benefit charges. Performance would have been lower had the Optional Death       
Benefit been available and been chosen.                                         

In addition to the standardized total return, the Sub-Account may advertise a   
non-standardized total return. This figure will usually be calculated since the 
inception

of the underlying fund for one year, five years, and ten years or               
other periods. Non-standardized total return is measured in the same manner as  
the standardized total return described above, except that the contingent       
deferred sales charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee are not deducted.          
Therefore, non-standardized total return for a Sub-Account is higher than       
standardized total return for a Sub-Account. The following are the              
non-standardized annualized total return quotations for the Sub-Accounts.

Benefit charges. Performance would have been lower had the Optional Death

 PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS

YIELD AND TOTAL RETURN. The total return and yield may also be used to compare  
the performance of the Sub-Accounts against certain widely acknowledged outside 
standards or indices for stock and bond market performance. Index performance is
not representative of the performance of the Sub-Account to which it is compared
and is not adjusted for commissions and other costs. Portfolio holdings of the  
Sub-Account will differ from those of the index to which it is compared.        
Performance comparison indices include the following:                           

The Consumer Price Index, prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a 
commonly used measure of the rate of inflation. The index shows the average     
change in the cost of selected consumer goods and services and does not         
represent a return on an investment vehicle.                                    

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an unmanaged list of 30 common stocks       
frequently used as a general measure of stock market performance. Its           
performance figures reflect changes of market prices and reinvestment of all    
distributions.                                                                  

Lehman Brothers Corporate Bond Index is an unmanaged list of publicly issued,   
fixed-rate, non-convertible investment-grade domestic corporate debt securities 
frequently used as a general measure of the performance of fixed-income         
securities. The average quality of bonds included in the index may be higher    
than the average quality of those bonds in which a Fund customarily invests. The
index does not include bonds in certain of the lower rating classifications in  
which a Fund may invest. The performance figures of the index reflect changes in
market prices and reinvestment of all interest payments.                        

The Lehman Brothers Government Bond Index (the "SL Government Index") is a      
measure of the market value of all public obligations of the U.S. Treasury; all 
publicly issued debt of all agencies of the U.S. Government and all             
quasi-federal corporations; and all corporate debt guaranteed by the U.S.       
Government. Mortgage-backed securities, flower bonds and foreign targeted issues
are not included in the SL Government Index.                                    

The Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond Index (the "SL                    
Government/Corporate Index") is a measure of the market value of approximately  
5,300 bonds with a face value currently in excess of $1.3 trillion. To be       
included in the SL Government/Corporate Index, an issue must have amounts       
outstanding in excess of $1 million, have at least one year to maturity and be  
rated "Baa" or higher ("investment grade") by a nationally recognized rating    
agency. The index does not include bonds in

certain of the lower-rating classifications in which a Fund may invest. Its     
performance figures reflect changes in market prices and reinvestment of all    
interest payments. Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index is an       
unmanaged list of approximately 1,450 equity securities listed on the stock     
exchanges of the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the  
Far East, with all values expressed in U.S. dollars. Performance figures reflect
changes in market prices and reinvestment of distributions net of withholding   
taxes. The securities in the index change over time to maintain                 
representativeness.                                                             

The NASDAQ-OTC Industrial Average (The "NASDAQ Index") is a market              
value-weighted and unmanaged index showing the changes in the aggregate market  
value of approximately 3,500 stocks relative to the base measure of 100.00 on   
February 5, 1971. The NASDAQ Index is composed entirely of common stocks of     
companies traded over-the-counter and often through the National Association of 
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations ("NASDAQ") system. Only those           
over-the-counter stocks having only one market maker or traded on exchanges are 
excluded. Its performance figures reflect changes of market prices but do not   
reflect reinvestment of cash dividends.                                         

Salomon Brothers Long-Term High-Grade Corporate Bond Index is an unmanaged list 
of publicly traded corporate bonds having a rating of at least AA by Standard & 
Poor's or Aa by Moody's and is frequently used as general measure of the        
performance of fixed-income securities. The average quality of bonds included in
the index may be higher than the average quality of those bonds in which a Fund 
may customarily invest. The index does not include bonds in certain of the lower
rating classifications in which a Fund may invest. Performance figures for the  
index reflect changes of market prices and reinvestment of all distributions.   

The Salomon Brothers 7-10 Year Government Bond Index is an unmanaged list of    
U.S. Government and government agency securities with maturities of 7 to 10     
years. Performance figures for the index reflect changes of market prices and   
reinvestment of all interest payments.                                          

The Standard & Poor's Composite Index of 500 stocks (the "S&P 500") is a market 
value-weighted and unmanaged index showing changes in the aggregate market value
of 500 stocks relative to the base period 1941-43. The S&P 500 is composed      
almost entirely of common stocks of companies listed on the New York Stock      
Exchange, although the common stocks of a few companies listed on the American  
Stock Exchange or traded over-the-counter are included. The 500 companies       
represented include 400 industrial, 60 transportation and 40 financial services 
concerns. The S&P 500 represents about 80% of the market value of all issues    
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Its performance figures reflect changes  
of market prices and reinvestment of all regular cash dividends.                

The Standard & Poor's 40 Utilities Index is unmanaged list of 40 utility stocks.
The

related statements of operations and the statements of changes in net assets for
the periods presented. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Account's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these      
financial statements based on our audits.                                       

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by      
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.          

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of the Account as of December 31,
1999, and the results of its operations and the changes in its net assets for   
the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting          
principles.

HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                     
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 1999 
1.  ORGANIZATION:                                                             

    Separate Account Three (the Account) is a separate investment account within
   Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (the Company) and is registered
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a unit investment trust
  under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Both the Company and
  the Account are subject to supervision and regulation by the Department of
Insurance of the State of Connecticut and the SEC. The Account invests  
    deposits by variable annuity contractowners of the Company in various mutual
funds (the Funds) as directed by the contractowners.                    

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:                                          

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the    
Account, which are in accordance with generally accepted accounting     
principles in the investment company industry:                          

a)  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS--Security transactions are recorded on the trade
  date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains and
       losses on the sales of securities are computed on the basis of identified
cost of the fund shares sold. Dividend and capital gains income is
 accrued as of the ex-dividend date. Capital gains income represents
     dividends from the Funds which are characterized as capital gains under
tax regulations.                                                  

  b)  SECURITY VALUATION--The investments in shares of the Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, the Van Kampen Life   
   Investment Trust, and the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Universal Funds,
       Inc. are valued at the closing net asset value per share as determined by
the appropriate Fund as of December 31, 1999.                     

c)  UNIT TRANSACTIONS--Unit transactions are executed based on the unit   
values calculated at the close of the business day.               

 d)  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES--The operations of the Account form a part of, and
       are taxed with, the total operations of the Company, which is taxed as an
      insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code. Under current law, no
    Federal income taxes are payable with respect to the operations of the
Account.                                                          

 e)  USE OF ESTIMATES--The preparation of financial statements in conformity
       with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
      estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported
    amounts of income and expenses during the period. Operating results in
the future could vary from the amounts derived from management's  
estimates.                                                        

3.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACCOUNT AND RELATED CHARGES:                        

a)  MORTALITY AND EXPENSE UNDERTAKINGS--The Company, as issuer of variable
     annuity contracts, provides the mortality and expense undertakings and,
       with respect to the Account, receives a maximum annual fee of up to 1.50%
  of the Account's average daily net assets. The Company also provides
administrative services and receives an annual fee of 0.15% of the
Account's average daily net assets.                               

   b)  DEDUCTION OF ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE--Annual maintenance fees are deducted
       through termination of units of interest from applicable contract owners'
    accounts, in accordance with the terms of the contracts. These charges
are reflected in surrenders for benefit payments and fees on the  
accompanying statements of changes in net assets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
----------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors of                                                    
Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company:                                    

We have audited the accompanying statutory balance sheets of Hartford Life and  
Annuity Insurance Company (a Connecticut Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Hartford Life Insurance Company) (the Company) as of December 31, 1999 and   
1998, and the related statutory statements of operations, changes in capital and
surplus, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1999. These statutory financial statements are the responsibility of the    
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these      
statutory financial statements based on our audits.                             

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

The Company presents its financial statements in conformity with statutory      
accounting practices as described in Note 2 of notes to statutory financial     
statements. When financial statements are presented for purposes other than for 
filing with a regulatory agency, auditing standards generally accepted in the   
United States require that an auditors' report on them state whether they are   
presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the    
United States. The accounting practices used by the Company vary from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States as explained and quantified  
in Note 2.                                                                      

In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter discussed in the preceding 
paragraph, the statutory financial statements referred to above do not present  
fairly, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the      
United States, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, or the results of its operations or its cash flows for each of the three  
years in the period ended December 31, 1999.                                    

In our opinion, the statutory financial statements referred to above present    
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of   
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity 
with statutory accounting practices as described in Note 2.                     

Hartford, Connecticut

(STATUTORY BASIS)

1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:                                    

Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (the "Company") is a wholly owned   
subsidiary of Hartford Life Insurance Company ("HLIC"), which is an indirect    
subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI"). HLI is indirectly majority owned by  
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("The Hartford"). On February 10,
1997, HLI filed a registration statement, as amended, with the Securities and   
Exchange Commission relating to the initial public offering of HLI Class A      
Common Stock (the "Offering"). Pursuant to the Offering on May 22, 1997, HLI    
sold to the public 26 million shares, representing approximately 18.6% of the   
equity ownership of HLI.                                                        

In 1998, the Company changed its name to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance    
Company from ITT Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company.                   

The Company offers a complete line of fixed and variable annuities, as well as  
variable, universal and traditional individual life insurance.                  

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:                                  
BASIS OF PRESENTATION                                                           

The accompanying statutory basis financial statements of the Company were       
prepared in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or        
permitted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and   
the State of Connecticut Department of Insurance. Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year    
presentation.                                                                   

Current prescribed statutory accounting practices include accounting            
publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general        
administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass        
accounting practices approved by state insurance departments. The Company does  
not follow any permitted statutory accounting practices that have a material    
effect on statutory surplus, statutory net income or risk-based capital.        

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets  
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could      
differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates include those used  
in determining the liability for aggregate reserves for future benefits and the 
liability for premium and other deposit funds. Although some variability is     
inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are       
adequate.                                                                       

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES VERSUS GAAP                                      

Statutory accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles     
("GAAP") differ in certain significant respects. These differences principally  
involve:                                                                        

(1) treatment of policy acquisition costs (commissions, underwriting and selling
expenses, etc.) which are charged to expense when incurred for statutory
 purposes rather than on a pro-rata basis over the expected life and gross
profit stream of the policy for GAAP purposes;                          

(2) recognition of premium revenues, which for statutory purposes are generally 
 recorded as collected or when due during the premium paying period of the
contract and which for GAAP purposes, for universal life policies and   
 investment products, generally only consist of charges assessed to policy
account balances for cost of insurance, policy administration and       
  surrenders. When policy charges received relate to coverage or services to
be provided in the future, the charges are recognized as revenue on a   
    pro-rata basis over the expected life and gross profit stream of the policy.
 Also, for GAAP purposes, premiums for traditional life insurance policies
are recognized as revenues when they are due from policyholders;        

(3) development of liabilities for future policy benefits, which for statutory  
purposes predominantly use interest rate and mortality assumptions      
prescribed by the NAIC which may vary considerably from interest and    
mortality assumptions used under GAAP;                                  

(4) providing for income taxes based on current taxable income only for         
statutory purposes, rather than establishing additional assets or       
 liabilities for deferred Federal income taxes to recognize the tax effect
related to reporting revenues and expenses in different periods for     
financial reporting and tax return purposes or required under GAAP;     

(5) excluding certain assets designated as non-admitted assets (e.g., negative  
Interest Maintenance Reserve, and past due agents' balances) from the   
balance sheet for statutory purposes by directly charging surplus;      

(6) the calculation of post retirement benefits obligation which, for statutory 
    accounting, excludes non-vested employees whereas GAAP liabilities include a
 provision for such employees; statutory and GAAP accounting permit either
   immediate recognition of the liability or straight-line amortization of the
liability over a period not to exceed 20 years. For GAAP, The Hartford's
    obligation was immediately recognized, whereas for statutory accounting, the
obligation is being recognized ratably over a 20 year period;           

F-6 

P-->485BPOS80th Page of 98TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 80th
(7) establishing a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to    
default and equity risk associated with certain invested assets (Asset  
Valuation Reserve) for statutory purposes; as well as the deferral and  
amortization of realized gains and losses, caused by changes in interest
 rates during the period the asset is held, into income over the remaining
life to maturity of the asset sold (Interest Maintenance Reserve) for   
statutory purposes; whereas on a GAAP basis, no such formula reserve is 
required and realized gains and losses are recognized in the period the 
asset is sold;                                                          

(8) the reporting of reserves and benefits net of reinsurance ceded for         
   statutory purposes; whereas on a GAAP basis, reserves are reported gross of
reinsurance with reserve credits presented as recoverable assets;       

(9) the reporting of fixed maturities at amortized cost for statutory purposes, 
whereas GAAP requires that fixed maturities be classified as            
"held-to-maturity," "available-for-sale" or "trading," based on the     
Company's intentions with respect to the ultimate disposition of the    
security and its ability to affect those intentions. The Company's bonds
    were classified on a GAAP basis as available-for-sale and accordingly, those
investments and common stocks were reflected at fair value with the     
corresponding impact included as a separate component of Stockholder's  
  Equity; as well as the change in the basis of the Company's other invested
    assets, which consist primarily of limited partnership investments, which is
  recognized as income under GAAP and as a change in surplus under statutory
accounting; and                                                         

(10) statutory accounting calculates separate account liabilities using         
 prescribed actuarial methodologies, which approximate the market value of
separate account assets less applicable surrender charges. The separate 
account surplus generated by these reserving methods is recorded as an  
 amount due to or from the separate account on the statutory basis balance
   sheet, with changes reflected in the statutory basis results of operations.
 On a GAAP basis, separate account assets and liabilities are held at fair
value.                                                                  

As of and for the years ended December 31, the significant differences between  
Statutory and GAAP basis net income and capital and surplus for the Company are 
as follows:                                                                     

                                                                [Download Table]

AGGREGATE RESERVES FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND LIABILITY FOR PREMIUM AND OTHER      
DEPOSIT FUNDS                                                                   

Aggregate reserves for payment of future life, health and annuity benefits were 
computed in accordance with applicable actuarial standards. Reserves for life   
insurance policies are generally based on the 1958 and 1980 Commissioner's      
Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables and various valuation rates ranging from 2.5%
to 6%. Accumulation and on-benefit annuity reserves are based principally on    
individual annuity tables at various rates ranging from                         

2.5% to 8.75% and using the Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method      
("CARVM").                                                                      
The Company has established separate accounts to segregate the assets and       
liabilities of certain life insurance and annuity contracts that must be        
segregated from the Company's general assets under the terms of its contracts.  
The assets consist primarily of marketable securities and are reported at market
value. Premiums, benefits and expenses of these contracts are reported in the   
statutory basis statements of operations.                                       

An analysis of Annuity Actuarial Reserves and Deposit Liabilities by Withdrawal 
Characteristics as of December 31, 1999 (including general and separate account 
liabilities) is as follows:

INVESTMENTS                                                                     

Investments in bonds are carried at amortized cost. Bonds that are deemed       
ineligible to be held at amortized cost by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office 
("SVO") are carried at the appropriate SVO published value. When a reduction in 
the value of a security is deemed to be unrecoverable, the decline in value is  
reported as a realized loss and the carrying value is adjusted accordingly.     
Short-term investments consist of money market funds and are stated at cost,    
which approximates fair value. Common stocks are carried at fair value with the 
current year change in the difference from cost reflected in surplus. Mortgage  
loans, which are carried at cost and approximate fair value, include investments
in assets backed by mortgage loan pools. Other invested assets are generally    
recorded at fair value.                                                         

The Asset Valuation Reserve ("AVR") is designed to provide a standardized       
reserving process for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity  
risks associated with invested assets. The AVR balances were $4,935 and $21,782 
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Additionally, the Interest      
Maintenance Reserve ("IMR") captures net realized capital gains and losses, net 
of applicable income taxes, resulting from changes in interest rates and        
amortizes these gains or losses into income over the life of the bond or        
mortgage sold. The IMR balance as of December 31, 1999 is an asset balance of   
$981 and is reflected as a component of non-admitted assets in Unassigned Funds 
in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The IMR balance as of        
December 31, 1998 is a liability balance of $452 and is reflected as an other   
liability. The net capital (losses) gains transferred to the IMR in 1999, 1998  
and 1997 were $(1,255), $852 and $(719), respectively. The amount of income     
(expense) amortized from the IMR in 1999, 1998 and 1997 included in the         
Company's Statements of Operations, was $178, $(207), and $(85), respectively.  
Realized capital gains and losses, net of taxes, not included in the IMR are    
reported in the statutory basis statements of operations. Realized investment   
gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.             

CODIFICATION                                                                    

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles in March   
1998. The proposed effective date for this statutory accounting guidance is     
January 1, 2001. It is expected that Connecticut, the Company's domiciliary     
state, will adopt these accounting standards and, therefore, the Company will   
make the necessary accounting and reporting changes required for implementation.
The Company has not yet determined the impact that these new accounting         
standards will have on its statutory basis financial statements.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of   
each class of financial instruments: fair value of bonds, short-term            
investments, common stock, and other invested assets approximate those          
quotations published by the NAIC; policy loans and mortgage loans carrying      
amounts approximates fair value; and fair value of liabilities on deposit funds 
and other benefits is determined by forecasting future cash flows and           
discounting the forecasted cash flows at current market rates.                  

4. REINSURANCE:                                                                 
The Company cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum     
losses. Such transfer does not relieve the Company of its primary liability to  
the policyholder. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result 
in losses to the Company. The Company reduces this risk by evaluating the       
financial condition of reinsurers and monitoring for possible concentrations of 
credit risk.                                                                    

The Company cedes significant portions of its variable annuity business written 
since 1994 to RGA Reinsurance Company ("RGA"). Certain core annuity products    
were excluded from this reinsurance arrangement beginning in the second quarter 
of 1999 and, as such, the amounts ceded to RGA have declined significantly.     

In 1995, The Hartford was "spun-off" from ITT Industries, Inc. and became its   
own, autonomous entity. In conjunction with this spin-off, the assets and       
liabilities of Lyndon Insurance Company (Lyndon) were merged into the Company.  
The statutory net assets contributed to the Company as a result of this         
transaction were approximately $112 million and were reflected as an increase in
Gross Paid-In and Contributed Surplus at December 31, 1995. This amount was     
approximately $41 million lower than the value of net assets contributed on a   
GAAP basis.                                                                     

The majority of the business written in Lyndon was assumed from an unaffiliated 
insurer. In 1998, this unaffiliated insurer recaptured the inforce blocks of    
business it had been ceding to the Company through Lyndon. In conjunction with  
this commutation transaction, the Company transferred statutory basis reserves  
of $26,404. Additionally, the Company received fair value consideration for the 
bonds it transferred which exceeded the statutory statement value of these      
assets by $25,622. As a result of this activity, the Company recognized a       
pre-tax gain from this transaction of $52,026 in its 1998 Statements of         
Operations.                                                                     

There were no material reinsurance recoverables from reinsurers outstanding as  
of and for the years ended, December 31, 1999 and 1998.

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:                                                  

Transactions between the Company and its affiliates, relate principally to tax  
settlements, reinsurance, insurance coverages, rental and service fees, capital 
contributions and payments of dividends. In addition, certain affiliated        
insurance companies purchased group annuity contracts from the Company to fund  
pension costs and claim annuities to settle casualty claims. Substantially all  
general insurance expenses related to the Company, including rent and benefit   
plan expenses, are initially paid by The Hartford. Direct expenses are allocated
using specific identification and indirect expenses are allocated using other   
applicable methods. Indirect expenses include those for corporate areas which,  
depending on type, are allocated based on either a percentage of direct expenses
or on utilization.                                                              

The Company has also invested in bonds of its affiliates, Hartford Financial    
Services Corporation and HL Investment Advisors, Inc., and common stock of its  
subsidiary, Hartford Life, LTD.                                                 

For additional information, see Notes 4, 6, and 8.                              

6. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:                                                        
The Company and The Hartford have entered into a tax sharing agreement under    
which each member in the consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return will make  
payments between them such that, with respect to any period, the amount of taxes
to be paid by the Company, subject to certain adjustments, generally will be    
determined as though the Company were filing separate Federal, state and local  
income tax returns.                                                             

As long as The Hartford continues to own at least 80% of the combined voting    
power and 80% of the value of the outstanding capital stock of HLI, the Company 
will be included for Federal income tax purposes in the affiliated group of     
which The Hartford is the common parent. The Hartford and its non-life          
subsidiaries filed a single consolidated Federal income tax return for 1998 and 
1997 and intend to file a separate consolidated Federal income tax return for   
1999. The life insurance companies filed a separate consolidated Federal income 
tax return for 1998 and 1997 and intend to file a separate consolidated Federal 
income tax return for 1999. Federal income taxes (received) paid by the Company 
for operations and capital gains (losses) were $(8,815), $25,780, and $(14,499) 
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The effective tax rate was (73)%, 27%, and
(28)% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

7. CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AND SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS:                   

The maximum amount of dividends which can be paid to shareholders by Connecticut
domiciled insurance companies, without prior approval, is generally restricted  
to the greater of 10% of surplus as of the preceding December 31st or the net   
gain from operations for the previous year. Dividends are paid as determined by 
the Board of Directors and are not cumulative. No dividends were paid in 1999,  
1998 or 1997. The amount available for dividend in 2000 is approximately        
$60,855.                                                                        

8. PENSION, RETIREMENT, AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: 

All employees that work for The Hartford's life insurance companies are included
in The Hartford's non-contributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans   
provide pension benefits that are based on years of service and the employee's  
compensation during the last ten years of employment. The Hartford's funding    
policy is to contribute annually an amount between the minimum funding          
requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,  
as amended, and the maximum amount that can be deducted for U.S. Federal income 
tax purposes. Generally, pension costs are funded through the purchase of group 
pension contracts sold by affiliates. The costs that were allocated to the      
Company for pension related expenses were $762, $1,045 and $840 for 1999, 1998  
and 1997, respectively.                                                         

Employees of The Hartford's life insurance companies are also provided, through 
The Hartford, certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible      
retired employees. The contribution for health care benefits depends on the     
retiree's date of retirement and years of service. In addition, this benefit    
plan has a defined dollar cap, which limits average company contributions. The  
Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care and life insurance          
obligations through trust funds where such prefunding can be accomplished on a  
tax effective basis. Postretirement health care and life insurance benefits     
expense allocated to the Company was not material to the results of operations  
for 1999, 1998 or 1997.                                                         

The assumed rate in the per capita cost of health care (the health care trend   
rate) was 7.1% for 1999, decreasing ratably to 5.0% in the year 2003. Increasing
the health care trend rates by one percent per year would have an immaterial    
impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual      
expense. To the extent that the actual experience differs from the inherent     
assumptions, the effect will be amortized over the average future service of    
covered employees.                                                              

Substantially all of The Hartford's life insurance companies' employees are     
eligible to participate in The Hartford's Investment and Savings Plan. Under    
this plan, designated contributions, which may be invested in Class A Common    
Stock of HLI or certain other investments, are matched to a limit of 3% of      
compensation.                                                                   

9. SEPARATE ACCOUNTS:                                                           
The Company maintains separate account assets totaling $44.9 billion and $32.9  
billion as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Separate account assets 
are segregated from other investments and reported at fair value. Separate      
account liabilities are determined in accordance with prescribed actuarial      
methodologies, which approximate the market value less applicable surrender     
charges. The resulting surplus is recorded in the general account statement of  
operations as a component of Net Transfers to Separate Accounts. The Company's  
separate accounts are non-guaranteed, wherein the policyholder assumes          
substantially all the investment risk and rewards. Investment income (including 
investment gains and losses) and interest credited to policyholders on separate 
account assets are not separately reflected in the statutory statements of      
operations.                                                                     

Separate account management fees, net of minimum guarantees, were $493 million, 
$363 million, and $252 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and are    
recorded as a component of fee income on the Company's statutory basis          
Statements of Operations.

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES:                                     
(A) LITIGATION                                                              
The Company is involved in pending and threatened litigation in the normal      
course of its business in which claims for alleged economic and punitive damages
have been asserted. Some of these cases have been filed as purported class      
actions and some cases have been filed in certain jurisdictions that permit     
punitive damage awards disproportionate to the actual damages incurred. Although
there can be no assurances, at the present time, the Company does not anticipate
that the ultimate liability, arising from such pending or threatened litigation,
will have a material adverse effect on the statutory capital and surplus of the 
Company.                                                                        

(B) GUARANTY FUNDS                                                          

Under insurance guaranty fund laws in each state, the District of Columbia and  
Puerto Rico, insurers licensed to do business can be assessed by state insurance
guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies  
to policyholders and claimants. Recent regulatory actions against certain large 
life insurers encountering financial difficulty have prompted various state     
insurance guaranty associations to begin assessing life insurance companies for 
the deemed losses. Most of these laws do provide, however, that an assessment   
may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer's solvency and       
further provide annual limits on such assessments. Part of the assessments paid 
by the Company pursuant to these laws may be used as credits for a portion of   
the associated premium taxes. The Company paid guaranty fund assessments of     
approximately $523, $1,043 and $1,544 in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, of 
which $318, $995, and $548 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively were estimated  
to be creditable against premium taxes.                                         

(C) TAX MATTERS                                                             
The Company's Federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal  
Revenue Service ("IRS"). The Company's 1997 and 1996 Federal income tax returns 
are currently under audit by the IRS. As of March 31, 2000, the audit was in its
initial stage and no material issues had been raised.

Item 28.  Indemnification

  Sections 33-770 to 33-778, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
         Statutes ("CGS") provide that a corporation may provide indemnification
   of or advance expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent.
Reference is hereby made to Section 33-771(e) of CGS regarding
     indemnification of directors and Section 33-776(d) of CGS regarding
  indemnification of officers, employees and agents of Connecticut
    corporations. These statutes provide, in general, that Connecticut
         corporations incorporated prior to January 1, 1997 shall, except to the
   extent that their certificate of incorporation expressly provides
      otherwise, indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents
   against "liability" (defined as the obligation to pay a judgment,
  settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with
      respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses incurred
         with respect to a proceeding) when (1) a determination is made pursuant
      to Section 33-775 that the party seeking indemnification has met the
    standard of conduct set forth in Section 33-771 or (2) a court has
    determined that indemnification is appropriate pursuant to Section
33-774. Under Section 33-775, the determination of and the    
     authorization for indemnification are made (a) by the disinterested
         directors, as defined in Section 33-770(3); (b) by special counsel; (c)
  by the shareholders; or (d) in the case of indemnification of an
       officer, agent or employee of the corporation, by the general counsel
       of the corporation or such other officer(s) as the board of directors
     may specify. Also, Section 33-772 provides that a corporation shall
    indemnify an individual who was wholly successful on the merits or
     otherwise against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection
        with a proceeding to which he was a party because he was a director of
        the corporation. In the case of a proceeding by or in the right of the
         corporation or with respect to conduct for which the director, officer,
       agent or employee was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a
    financial benefit to which he was not entitled, indemnification is
limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
        proceeding against the corporation to which the individual was named a
party.                                                        

 Under the Depositor's bylaws, the Depositor must indemnify both
directors and officers of the Depositor for (1) any claims and
       liabilities to which they become subject by reason of being or having
     been directors or officers of the Depositor and (2) legal and other
      expenses incurred in defending against such claims, in each case, to
the extent such is consistent with statutory provisions.      

        Section 33-777 of CGS specifically authorizes a corporation to procure
indemnification insurance on behalf of an individual who was a
     director, officer, employer or agent of the corporation. Consistent
   with the statute, the directors and officers of the Depositor and
    Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered
under a directors and

      officers liability insurance policy issued to The Hartford Financial
Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.                    

         Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
     Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
    persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
       otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
         public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
        In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
        (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid
       by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
      successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
     such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
         securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion
      of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
         submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
        indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Prospectus describes information you should know before you purchase the   
Select Dimensions AssetManager variable annuity. Please read it carefully.      

Select Dimensions AssetManager variable annuity is a contract between you and   
Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company where you agree to make at least one
Premium Payment to us and we agree to make a series of Annuity Payouts at a     
later date. This Annuity is a flexible premium, tax-deferred, variable annuity  
offered to both individuals and groups. It is:                                  

x  Flexible, because you may add Premium Payments at any time.                  

x  Tax-deferred, which means you don't pay taxes until you take money out or    
until we start to make Annuity Payouts.                                   

x  Variable, because the value of your Annuity will fluctuate with the          
performance of the underlying funds.                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time you purchase your Annuity, you allocate your Premium Payment to     
"Sub-Accounts." These are subdivisions of our Separate Account, an account that 
keeps your Annuity assets separate from our company assets. The Sub-Accounts    
then purchase shares of mutual funds set up exclusively for variable annuity or 
variable life insurance products. These are not the same mutual funds that you  
buy through your stockbroker or through a retail mutual fund. They may have     
similar investment strategies and the same portfolio managers as retail mutual  
funds. This Annuity offers you Funds with investment strategies ranging from    
conservative to aggressive and you may pick those Funds that meet your          
investment goals and risk tolerance. The Sub-Accounts and the Funds are listed  
below:                                                                          

- MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT which purchases shares of Money Market Portfolio of  
the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series          

- NORTH AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES SUB-ACCOUNT which purchases shares of    
North American Government Securities Portfolio of the Morgan Stanley Dean   
Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series (effective September 7, 1999,    
closed to new investments or transfer of existing Contract Values)          

- DIVERSIFIED INCOME SUB-ACCOUNT which purchases shares of Diversified Income

(1) An annual $30 charge deducted on a Contract Anniversary or upon Surrender if
the Contract Value at either of those times is less than $100,000. It is
   deducted proportionately from the Accounts in which you are invested at the
time of the charge.                                                     

The purpose of the Fee Table and Examples is to assist you in understanding     
various costs and expenses that you will pay directly or indirectly. The Fee    
Table and Examples reflect expenses of the Separate Account and underlying      
Funds. We will deduct any Premium Taxes that apply.                             

The Examples should not be considered a representation of past or future        
expenses and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. The Annual
Maintenance Fee has been reflected in the Examples by a method intended to show 
the "average" impact of the Annual Maintenance Fee on an investment in the      
Separate Account. We do this by approximating an "average" 0.06% annual charge.

  in the table above has been restated to reflect the current fees. Prior to
December 31, 1999, the investment adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter   
Advisors Inc., assumed all expenses of the Portfolio and waived the     
    compensation provided for the Portfolio in its management agreement with the
Fund.

    if such fees would cause their respective "Total Fund Operating Expenses" to

    International Allocation Portfolio are annualized estimates. Including these
reductions, it is estimated that "Management Fees", "Other Expenses" and

HIGHLIGHTS                                                                      
HOW DO I PURCHASE THIS ANNUITY?                                                 

You must complete our application or order request and submit it to us for      
approval with your first Premium Payment. Your first Premium Payment must be at 
least $10,000 and subsequent Premium Payments must be at least $500, unless you 
take advantage of Automatic Additions or are part of certain retirement plans.  

 -  For a limited time, usually within ten days after you receive your Contract,
you may cancel your Annuity. You may bear the investment risk for your  
Premium Payment prior to our receipt of your request for cancellation.  

WHAT TYPE OF SALES CHARGE WILL I PAY?                                           

You don't pay a sales charge when you purchase your Annuity.                    

IS THERE AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE?                                             

We deduct this $30.00 fee each year on your Contract Anniversary or when you    
fully Surrender your Annuity, if, on either of those dates, the value of your   
Annuity is less than $100,000.                                                  

WHAT CHARGES WILL I PAY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?                                     

In addition to the Annual Maintenance Fee, you pay three different types of     
charges each year. The first type of charge is the fee you pay for insurance.   
This charge is:                                                                 

Before the Annuity Commencement Date, a mortality and expense risk charge is    
subtracted daily and is equal to an annual charge of 1.50% of your Contract     
Value invested in the Funds. After the Annuity Commencement Date, the mortality 
and expense risk charge drops to 1.25% of your Contract Value invested in the   
Funds.                                                                          

The second type of charge is the fee you pay for the Funds. See the Annual Fund 
Operating Expenses table for more complete information and the Funds'           
prospectuses accompanying this prospectus.                                      

The third type of charge is the administration fee which is subtracted daily and
is equal to an annual rate of 0.15% of Sub-Account Value during both the        
accumulation and annuity phases of the Contract.                                

If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we will subtract an additional charge  
on a daily basis which is equal to an annual charge of .15% of your Contract    
Value invested in the Funds.                                                    

CAN I TAKE OUT ANY OF MY MONEY?                                                 

You may Surrender all or part of the amounts you have invested at any time      
before we start making Annuity Payouts, or after Annuity Payouts begin under the
Payment for a Period Certain Annuity Payout Option.                             

- You may have to pay income tax on the money you take out and, if you Surrender
before you are age 59 1/2, you may have to pay an income tax penalty.       

WILL HARTFORD PAY A DEATH BENEFIT?                                              

Your Contract has a Death Benefit which is equal to the amount payable under the
standard Death Benefit or the Interest Accumulation Death Benefit ("Optional    
Death Benefit"). We pay the Death Benefit if the Contract Owner, joint owner or 
Annuitant, die before we begin to make annuity payments. The Death Benefit      
amount will remain invested in the Sub-Accounts according to your last          
instructions and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds. We
calculate the Death Benefit as of the date we receive a certified death         
certificate or other legal document acceptable to us.                           

If you do not elect the Optional Death Benefit, the Death Benefit will be the   
greater of:                                                                     

- The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any amounts you have     
Surrendered;                                                                

- The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                        

- Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                     

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on Contract  
Anniversaries of Contract Values, Premium Payments and partial Surrenders. We   
will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary prior to the  
deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, whichever is earlier. The Anniversary
Value is equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by 
the dollar amount of any Premium Payments made since that anniversary and       
reduced by the dollar amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary.  
The Maximum Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value        
attained from this series of calculations.                                      

If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, the Death Benefit will be the greater  
of:                                                                             

- the total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any Surrenders:          

- the Contract Value of your annuity;                                           

- your Maximum Anniversary Value or                                             

- your Interest Accumulation Value.                                             

Assuming you have not taken any Surrenders, your Interest Accumulation Value is 
calculated by accumulating interest on your Premium Payments at a rate of 5% per
year up to the deceased's 81(st) birthday or date of death, whichever is        
earlier. If you have taken any Surrenders, the 5% will be accumulated on your   
Premium Payments, but we will make an adjustment for any of the Surrenders. This
adjustment will reduce the Death Benefit under the Optional Death Benefit       
proportionally for the Surrenders. The Death Benefit under the Optional Death   
Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of Premium Payments, less proportional  
adjustments for any Surrenders. If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we will
subtract an additional charge on a daily basis which is equal to an annual      
charge of .15% of your Contract Value invested in the Funds.

The Optional Death Benefit may not be available if the Contract Owner or        
Annuitant is age 75 or older. The Optional Death Benefit is not available in    
Washington.                                                                     

If you purchase your Contract after September 30, 1999, you must elect the      
Optional Death Benefit at the time you send us your initial Premium Payment.    

WHAT ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?                                      

When it comes time for us to make payouts, you may choose one of the following  
Annuity Payout Options: Life Annuity, Life Annuity with a Cash Refund, Life     
Annuity with Payments for a Period Certain, Joint and Last Survivor Life

available at any time.                                                          

You must begin to take payouts by the Annuitant's 90th birthday or the end of   
the 10th Contract Year, whichever is later unless you elect a later date to     
begin receiving payments subject to the laws and regulations then in effect and 
our approval. If you do not tell us what Annuity Payout Option you want before  
that time, we will make payments under Life Annuity with Payments for a ten year
Period Certain.

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

The Separate Account is where we set aside and invest the assets of some of our 
annuity contracts, including this Contract. The Separate Account was established
on June 22, 1994 and is registered as a unit investment trust under the         
Investment Company Act of 1940. This registration does not involve supervision  
by the SEC of the management or the investment practices of the Separate Account
or Hartford. The Separate Account meets the definition of "Separate Account"    
under federal securities law. This Separate Account holds only assets for       
variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account:                               

- Holds assets for your benefit and the benefit of other Contract Owners, and   
the persons entitled to the payouts described in the Contract.              

- Is not subject to the liabilities arising out of any other business Hartford  
may conduct.                                                                

- Is not affected by the rate of return of Hartford's General Account or by the 
investment performance of any of Hartford's other Separate Accounts.        

- May be subject to liabilities from a Sub-Account of the Separate Account that 
holds assets of other variable annuity contracts offered by the Separate    
Account, which are not described in this prospectus.                        

- Is credited with income and gains, and takes losses, whether or not realized, 
from the assets it holds.                                                   

We do not guarantee the investment results of the Separate Account. There is no 
assurance that the value of your Annuity will equal the total of the payments   
you make to us.                                                                 

THE FUNDS                                                                       

The underlying investment for the Contracts are shares of the portfolios of     
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, The Universal   
Institutional Funds, Inc., and Van Kampen Life Investment Trust, all open-ended 
management investment companies. The underlying portfolios corresponding to each
Sub-Account and their investment objectives are described below. Hartford       
reserves the right, subject to compliance with the law, to offer additional     
portfolios with differing investment objectives. The portfolios may not be      
available in all states.                                                        

We do not guarantee the investment results of any of the underlying portfolios. 
Since each underlying portfolio has different investment objectives, each is    
subject to different risks. These risks and the portfolio's expenses are more   
fully described in the accompanying Funds' prospectuses and the Statements of   
Additional Information. The Funds' prospectuses should be read in conjunction   
with this prospectus before investing.

insured), repurchase agreements and high grade corporate debt obligations       
maturing in thirteen months or less.                                            

NORTH AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO (EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 7, 1999,    
CLOSED TO NEW INVESTMENTS OR TRANSFERS OF EXISTING CONTRACT VALUES) -- Seeks to 
earn a high level of current income while maintaining relatively low volatility 
of principal, by investing primarily in investment grade fixed-income securities
issued or guaranteed by the U.S., Canadian or Mexican governments.              

DIVERSIFIED INCOME PORTFOLIO -- Seeks, as a primary objective, to earn a high   
level of current income and, as a secondary objective, to maximize total return,
but only to the extent consistent with its primary objective, by equally        
allocating its assets among three separate groupings of fixed-income securities.
Up to one-third of the securities in which the Diversified Income Portfolio may 
invest will include securities rated Baa/BBB or lower. See the Special          
Considerations for investments for high yield securities disclosed in the Fund's
prospectus.                                                                     

BALANCED GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to provide capital growth with reasonable    
current income by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 60% of its
total assets in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of companies which have
a record of paying dividends and, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, have
the potential for increasing dividends and in securities convertible into common
stock, and at least 25% of its total assets in investment grade fixed-income    
(fixed-rate and adjustable-rate) securities such as corporate notes and bonds   
and obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies and   
its instrumentalities.                                                          

UTILITIES PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to provide both capital appreciation and current   
income.                                                                         

DIVIDEND GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to provide reasonable current income and     
long-term growth of income and capital by investing primarily in common stock of
companies with a record of paying dividends and the potential for increasing    
dividends.                                                                      

VALUE-ADDED MARKET PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to achieve a high level of total return on
its assets through a combination of capital appreciation and current income, by 
investing, on an equally-weighted basis, in a diversified portfolio of common   
stocks of the companies which are represented in the Standard & Poor's 500      
Composite Stock Price Index.                                                    

GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in 
common stocks and securities convertible into common stocks issued by domestic  
and foreign companies.                                                          

AMERICAN OPPORTUNITIES PORTFOLIO (FORMERLY NAMED AMERICAN VALUE                 
PORTFOLIO) -- Seeks long-term capital growth consistent with an effort to reduce
volatility, by investing principally in common stock of companies in industries 
which, at the time of the investment, are believed to be attractively valued    
given their above average relative earnings growth potential at that time.      

MID-CAP EQUITY PORTFOLIO (FORMERLY NAMED MID-CAP GROWTH PORTFOLIO) -- Seeks     
long-term capital growth by investing primarily in equity securities of medium  
sized companies (that is, companies whose equity market capitalization falls    
within the range of companies comprising the S&P 400 Index).                    

GLOBAL EQUITY PORTFOLIO -- Seeks to obtain total return on its assets primarily 
through long-term capital growth and, to a lesser extent, from income, through  
investments in all types of common stocks and equivalents (such as convertible  
securities and warrants), preferred stocks and bonds and other debt obligations 
of domestic and foreign companies, governments and international organizations. 

DEVELOPING GROWTH PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term capital growth by investing      
primarily in common stocks of smaller and medium-sized companies that, in the   
opinion of the Investment Manager, have the potential for growing more rapidly  
than the economy and which may benefit from new products or services,           
technological developments or changes in management.                            

EMERGING MARKETS PORTFOLIO (EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 7, 1999, CLOSED TO NEW          
INVESTMENTS OR TRANSFERS OF EXISTING CONTRACT VALUES) -- Seeks long-term capital
appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of companies in        
emerging market countries. The Emerging Markets Portfolio may invest up to 35%  
of its total assets in high risk fixed-income securities that are rated below   
investment grade or are unrated (commonly referred to as "junk bonds"). See the 
Special Considerations for investments in high yield securities disclosed in the
Fund's prospectus.                                                              

THE UNIVERSAL INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS, INC.:                                        

HIGH YIELD PORTFOLIO -- Seeks above-average total return over a market cycle of 
three to five years by investing primarily in high yield securities (commonly   
referred to as "junk bonds"). The Portfolio also may invest in investment grade 
fixed income securities, including U.S. Government securities, corporate bonds  
and mortgage securities. The Portfolio may invest to a limited extent in foreign
fixed income securities, including emerging market securities. The Investment   
Adviser may use futures, swaps and other types of derivatives in managing the   
Portfolio.                                                                      

MID-CAP VALUE PORTFOLIO -- Seeks above-average total return over a market cycle 
of three to five years by investing in common stocks of companies with          
capitalizations in the range of companies included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index  
(currently $500 million to $6 billion). The Portfolio purchases stocks that     
typically do not pay dividends. The Investment Adviser analyzes securities to   
identify stocks that are undervalued, and measures the relative attractiveness  
of the Portfolio's current holdings against potential purchases.                

EMERGING MARKETS DEBT PORTFOLIO -- Seeks high total return by investing         
primarily in fixed income securities of government and government-related       
issuers and, to a lesser extent, of corporate issuers located in emerging market
countries. The Investment Adviser seeks high total return by investing in a     
portfolio of emerging market debt that offers low correlation to many other     
asset classes. Using macroeconomic and fundamental analysis, the Investment     
Adviser seeks to identify developing countries

that are undervalued and have attractive or improving fundamentals. After the   
country allocation is determined, the sector and security selection is made     
within each county.                                                             

EMERGING MARKETS EQUITY PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term capital appreciation by    
investing primarily in equity securities of issuers in emerging market          
countries. The Investment Adviser seeks to maximize returns by investing in     
growth-oriented equity securities in emerging markets. The Investment Adviser's 
investment approach combines top-down country allocation with bottom-up stock   
selection. Investment selection criteria include attractive growth              
characteristics, reasonable valuations and managements with a strong shareholder
value orientation.                                                              

FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO -- Seeks above-average total return over a market cycle  
of three to five years by investing primarily in a diversified mix of dollar    
denominated investment grade fixed income securities, particularly U.S.         
Government, corporate and mortgage securities. The Portfolio ordinarily will    
maintain an average weighted maturity in excess of five years. The Portfolio may
invest opportunistically in non-dollar denominated securities and below         
investment grade securities; and it may use futures, swaps and other types of   
derivatives in managing the Portfolio.                                          

ACTIVE INTERNATIONAL ALLOCATION PORTFOLIO -- Seeks long-term capital            
appreciation by investing primarily in accordance with country and sector       
weightings determined by the investment adviser in equity securities of non-U.S.
issuers which, in the aggregate, replicate broad-market indices. The Investment 
Adviser seeks to maintain a diversified portfolio of international equity       
securities based on a top-down approach that emphasizes country and sector      
selection and weighting rather than individual stock selection. The Investment  
Adviser capitalizes on the significance of country and sector selection in      
international equity portfolio returns by over and underweighting countries     
based on three factors: (i) valuation; (ii) fundamental change; and             
(iii) short-term market momentum/technicals.                                    

VAN KAMPEN LIFE INVESTMENT TRUST:                                               

STRATEGIC STOCK PORTFOLIO -- Seeks an above average total return through a      
combination of potential capital appreciation and dividend income, consistent   
with the preservation of invested capital. Under normal market conditions, the  
Portfolio's investment adviser seeks to achieve the investment objectives by    
investing in a portfolio of high dividend yielding equity securities of         
companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or in the Morgan Stanley 
Capital International USA Index.                                                

ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO -- Seeks capital appreciation through investments in       
securities believed by the Portfolio's investment adviser to have above average 
potential for capital appreciation.

adviser to several open-end investment companies. MAS is an indirect wholly-    
owned subsidiary of MSDW.                                                       

The Investment Adviser with respect to the Strategic Stock Portfolio and the    
Enterprise Portfolio is Van Kampen Asset Management Inc., a wholly owned        
subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc. Van Kampen Investments Inc. is an     
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of MSDW. Van Kampen Investments Inc. is a      
diversified asset management company with more than two million retail investor 
accounts, extensive capabilities for managing institutional portfolios, and more
than $90 billion under management or supervision as of December 31, 1999. Van

authorized dealers nationwide.                                                  

MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING -- Shares of the Funds may be sold to our other        
separate accounts and our insurance company affiliates or other unaffiliated    
insurance companies to serve as the underlying investment for both variable     
annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, a practice known as     
"mixed and shared funding." As a result, there is a possibility that a material 
conflict may arise between the interests of Contract Owners, and of owners of   
other contracts whose contract values are allocated to one or more of these     
other separate accounts investing in any one of the Funds. In the event of any  
such material conflicts, we will consider what action may be appropriate,       
including removing the Fund from the Separate Account or replacing the Fund with
another underlying fund. There are certain risks associated with mixed and      
shared funding, as disclosed in the Funds' prospectuses.                        

VOTING RIGHTS -- We are the legal owners of all Fund shares held in the Separate
Account and we have the right to vote at the Fund's shareholder meetings. To the
extent required by federal securities laws or regulations, we will:             

- Notify you of any Fund shareholders' meeting if the shares held for your      
Contract may be voted.                                                      

- Send proxy materials and a form of instructions that you can use to tell us   
how to vote the Fund shares held for your Contract.                         

- Arrange for the handling and tallying of proxies received from Contract       
Owners.                                                                     

- Vote all Fund shares attributable to your Contract according to instructions  
received from you, and                                                      

- Vote all Fund shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same
proportion as shares for which instructions have been received.             

If any federal securities laws or regulations, or their present interpretation, 
change to permit us to vote Fund shares on our own, we may decide to do so. You 
may attend any Shareholder Meeting at which shares held for your Contract may be
voted. After we begin to make Annuity Payouts to you, the number of votes you   
have will decrease.                                                             

SUBSTITUTIONS, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS OF FUNDS -- We reserve the right, subject
to any applicable law, to make certain changes to the Funds offered under your  
Contract. We may, in our sole discretion, establish new Funds. New Funds will be
made available to existing Contract Owners as we determine appropriate. We may  
also close one or more Funds to additional Payments or transfers from existing  
Sub-Accounts.                                                                   

We reserve the right to eliminate the shares of any of the Funds for any reason 
and to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares
of any Fund already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate  
Account. To the extent required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940
Act"), substitutions of shares attributable to your interest in a Fund will not 
be made until we have the approval of the Commission and we have notified you of
the change.                                                                     

In the event of any substitution or change, we may, by appropriate endorsement, 
make any changes in the Contract necessary or appropriate to reflect the        
substitution or change. If we decide that it is in the best interest of         
Contracts Owners, the Separate Account may be operated as a management company  
under the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by law, may be de-registered     
under the 1940 Act in the event such registration is no longer required, or may 
be combined with one or more other Separate Accounts.                           

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES -- Hartford has entered into agreements with the        
investment advisers or distributors of many of the Funds. Under the terms of    
these agreements, Hartford provides administrative services and the Funds pay a 
fee to Hartford that is usually based on an annual percentage of the average    
daily net assets of the Funds. These agreements may be different for each Fund  
or each Fund family.                                                            

PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information      
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is     
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future 
performance.                                                                    

When a Sub-Account advertises its STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN, it will usually be 
calculated since the inception of the Separate Account for one year, five years,
and ten years or some other relevant periods if the Sub-Account has not been in 
existence for at least ten years. Total return is measured by comparing the     

P-->49719th Page of 79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 19th
HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                   19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
value of an investment in the Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant      
period to the value of the investment at the end of the period.                 

In addition to the standardized total return, the Sub-Account may advertise a   
NON-STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN that predates the inception of the Separate       
Account. This figure will usually be calculated for one year, five years, and   
ten years or other periods. Non-standardized total return is measured in the    
same manner as the standardized total return described above, except that the   
Annual Maintenance Fee is not deducted. Therefore, non-standardized total return
for a Sub-Account is higher than standardized total return for a Sub-Account.   
These non-standardized returns must be accompanied by standardized total        
returns.                                                                        

If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise YIELD IN ADDITION TO TOTAL RETURN.
The yield will be computed in the following manner: The net investment income   
per unit earned during a recent one month period is divided by the unit value on
the last day of the period. This figure includes the recurring charges at the   
Separate Account level including the Annual Maintenance Fee.                    

The Money Market Fund Sub-Account may advertise YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD. The  
yield of a Sub-Account is based upon the income earned by the Sub-Account over a
seven-day period and then annualized, i.e. the income earned in the period is   
assumed to be earned every seven days over a 52-week period and stated as a     
percentage of the investment. Effective yield is calculated similarly but when  
annualized, the income earned by the investment is assumed to be reinvested in  
Sub-Account units and thus compounded in the course of a 52-week period. Yield  
and effective yield include the recurring charges at the Separate Account level 
including the Annual Maintenance Fee.                                           

We may provide information on various topics to Contract Owners and prospective 
Contract Owners in advertising, sales literature or other materials. These      
topics may include the relationship between sectors of the economy and the      
economy as a whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment     
strategies and techniques (such as systematic investing, Dollar Cost Averaging  
and asset allocation), the advantages and disadvantages of investing in         
tax-deferred and taxable instruments, customer profiles and hypothetical        
purchase scenarios, financial management and tax and retirement planning, and   
other investment alternatives, including comparisons between the Contract and   
the characteristics of and market for such alternatives.                        

THE CONTRACT 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURCHASES AND CONTRACT VALUE                                                    
WHAT TYPES OF CONTRACTS ARE AVAILABLE?                                          

The Contract is an individual or group tax-deferred variable annuity contract.  
It is designed for retirement planning purposes and may be purchased by any     
individual, group or trust, including:                                          

- Any trustee or custodian for a retirement plan qualified under Sections 401(a)
or 403(a) of the Code;                                                      

- Annuity purchase plans adopted by public school systems and certain tax-exempt
organizations according to Section 403(b) of the Code;                      

- Individual Retirement Annuities adopted according to Section 408 of the Code; 

- Employee pension plans established for employees by a state, a political      
subdivision of a state, or an agency of either a state or a political       
subdivision of a state, and                                                 

- Certain eligible deferred compensation plans as defined in Section 457 of the 
Code.                                                                       

The examples above represent Qualified Contracts, as defined by the Code. In    
addition, individuals and trusts can also purchase Contracts that are not part  
of a tax qualified retirement plan. These are known as Non-Qualified Contracts. 

If you are purchasing the Contract for use in an IRA or other qualified         
retirement plan, you should consider other features of the Contract besides tax 
deferral, since any investment vehicle used within an IRA or other qualified    
plan receives tax deferred treatment under the Code.                            

HOW DO I PURCHASE A CONTRACT?                                                   

You may purchase a Contract by completing and submitting an application or an   
order request along with an initial Premium Payment. For most Contracts, the    
minimum Premium Payment is $10,000. For additional Premium Payments, the minimum
Premium Payment is $500. Under certain situations, we may allow smaller Premium 
Payments, for example, if you enroll in Automatic Additions or are part of      
certain tax qualified retirement plans. Prior approval is required for Premium  
Payments of $1,000,000 or more.                                                 

You and your Annuitant must not be older than age 90 on the date that your      
Contract is issued. You must be of legal age in the state where the Contract is 
being purchased or a guardian must act on your behalf.                          

HOW ARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS APPLIED TO MY CONTRACT?                                

Your initial Premium Payment will be invested within two Valuation Days of our  
receipt of a properly completed application or an order request and the Premium 
Payment. If we receive your subsequent Premium Payment before the close of the  
New York Stock Exchange, it will be priced on the same Valuation Day. If we     
receive your Premium Payment after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, it 
will be invested on the next Valuation Day. If we receive your subsequent       
Premium Payment on a Non-Valuation Day, the amount will be invested on the next 
Valuation Day. Unless we receive new instructions, we will invest the           

P-->49720th Page of 79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 20th

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Premium Payment based on your last allocation instructions. We will send you a  
confirmation when we invest your Premium Payment.                               

If the request or other information accompanying the Premium Payment is         
incomplete when received, we will hold the money in a non-interest bearing      
account for up to five Valuation Days while we try to obtain complete           
information. If we cannot obtain the information within five Valuation Days, we 
will either return the Premium Payment and explain why the Premium Payment could
not be processed or keep the Premium Payment if you authorize us to keep it     
until you provide the necessary information.                                    

CAN I CANCEL MY CONTRACT AFTER I PURCHASE IT?                                   

We want you to be satisfied with the Contract you have purchased. We urge you to
closely examine its provisions. If for any reason you are not satisfied with    
your Contract, simply return it within ten days after you receive it with a     
written request for cancellation that indicates your tax-withholding            
instructions. In some states, you may be allowed more time to cancel your       
Contract. We may require additional information, including a signature          
guarantee, before we can cancel your Contract.                                  

You bear the investment risk from the time the Contract is issued until we      
receive your complete cancellation request.                                     

The amount we pay you upon cancellation depends on the requirements of the state
where you purchased your Contract, the method of purchase, the type of Contract 
you purchased and your age.                                                     

HOW IS THE VALUE OF MY CONTRACT CALCULATED BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE?

The Contract Value is the sum of all Accounts. There are two things that affect 
your Sub-Account value: (1) the number of Accumulation Units and (2) the        
Accumulation Unit Value. The Sub-Account value is determined by multiplying the 
number of Accumulation Units by the Accumulation Unit Value. Therefore, on any  
Valuation Day your Contract Value reflects the investment performance of the    
Sub-Accounts and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds.   

When Premium Payments are credited to your Sub-Accounts, they are converted into
Accumulation Units by dividing the amount of your Premium Payments, minus any   
Premium Taxes, by the Accumulation Unit Value for that day. The more Premium    
Payments you put into your Contract, the more Accumulation Units you will own.  
You decrease the number of Accumulation Units you have by requesting Surrenders,
transferring money out of an Account, settling a Death Benefit claim or by      
annuitizing your Contract.                                                      
To determine the current Accumulation Unit Value, we take the prior Valuation   
Day's Accumulation Unit Value and multiply it by the Net Investment Factor for  
the current Valuation Day.                                                      

The Net Investment Factor is used to measure the investment performance of a    
Sub-Account from one Valuation Day to the next. The Net Investment Factor for   
each Sub-Account equals:                                                        

- The net asset value per share of each Fund held in the Sub-Account at the end 
of the current Valuation Day divided by                                     

- The net asset value per share of each Fund held in the Sub-Account at the end 
of the prior Valuation Day; minus                                           

- The daily mortality and expense risk charge adjusted for the number of days in
the period, and any other applicable charge, including any Option Death     
Benefit Charge.                                                             

We will send you a statement in each calendar quarter, which tells you how many 
Accumulation Units you have, their value and your total Contract Value.         

CAN I TRANSFER FROM ONE SUB-ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER?                                 

TRANSFERS BETWEEN SUB-ACCOUNTS -- You may transfer from one Sub-Account to      
another before and after the Annuity Commencement Date at no extra charge. Your 
transfer request will be processed on the day that it is received as long as it 
is received on a Valuation Day before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. 
Otherwise, your request will be processed on the following Valuation Day. We    
will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer. You are responsible 
for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any errors     
within 30 days of receiving the confirmation.                                   

SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS -- We reserve the right to limit the number of
transfers to 12 per Contract Year, with no transfers occurring on consecutive   
Valuation Days. We also have the right to restrict transfers if we believe that 
the transfers could have an adverse effect on other Contract Owners. In all     
states except Florida, Maryland and Oregon, we may:                             

- Require a minimum time period between each transfer,                          

- Limit the dollar amount that may be transferred on any one Valuation Day, and 

- Not accept transfer requests from an agent acting under a power of attorney   
for more than one Contract Owner.                                           

We also have a restriction in place that involves individuals who act under a   
power of attorney for multiple Contract Owners. If the value of the Contract    
Owner's Accounts add up to more than $2 million, we will not accept transfer    
instructions from the power of attorney unless the power of attorney has entered
into a Third Party Transfer Services Agreement with us.                         

Some states may have different restrictions.                                    

TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSFERS -- In most states, you can make transfers:     

- By calling us at (800) 862-6668

Transfer instructions you send electronically are considered to be received by  
Hartford at the time and date stated on the electronic acknowledgement Hartford 
returns to you. If the time and date indicated on the acknowledgement is before 
the close of the New York Stock Exchange on a Valuation Day, the instructions   
will be carried out that day. Otherwise, the instructions will be carried out at
the close of the New York Stock Exchange the next Valuation Day. If you do not  
receive an electronic acknowledgement, you should telephone us as soon as       
possible.                                                                       

We will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer. You are          
responsible for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any
errors within 30 days of receiving the confirmation.                            

Telephone or Internet transfer requests may currently only be cancelled by      
calling us at (800) 862-6668 before the close of the New York Stock Exchange.   

Hartford, our agents or our affiliates are NOT responsible for losses resulting 
from telephone or electronic requests that we believe are genuine. We will use  
reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions received by telephone or     
through our website are genuine, including a requirement that contract owners   
provide certain identification information, including a personal identification 
number. We record all telephone transfer instructions. We reserve the right to  
suspend, modify, or terminate telephone or electronic transfer privileges at any
time.                                                                           

POWER OF ATTORNEY -- You may authorize another person to make transfers on your 
behalf by submitting a completed Power of Attorney form. Once we have the       
completed form on file, we will accept transfer instructions from your          
designated third party, subject to any transfer restrictions in place, until we 
receive new instructions in writing from you. You will not be able to make      
transfers or other changes to your Contract if you have authorized someone else 
to act under a Power of Attorney.                                               

CHARGES AND FEES                                                                

There are 5 charges and fees associated with the Contract and the Optional Death
Benefit charge:                                                                 

1. MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE                                            

For assuming risks under the Contract before the Annuity Commencement Date, we  
will deduct a daily charge at the annual rate of 1.50 % of Contract Value       
(estimated at .95% for mortality and .55% for expenses). After the Annuity      
Commencement Date, we will deduct a daily charge totaling 1.25% per year of     
Contract Value (estimated at .90% for mortality and .35% for expense).          

- MORTALITY RISK -- There are two types of mortality risks that we assume, those
 made while your Premium Payments are accumulating and those made once Annuity
Payouts have begun.                                                         

During the period your Premium Payments are accumulating, we are required to    
cover any difference between the Death Benefit paid and the Surrender Value.    
These differences may occur during periods of declining value. The risk that we 
bear during this period is that actual mortality rates may be lower than        
anticipated.                                                                    

Once Annuity Payouts have begun, we may be required to make Annuity Payouts as  
long as the Annuitant is living, regardless of how long the Annuitant lives. We 
would be required to make these payments if the Payout Option chosen is the Life
Annuity, Life Annuity With Payments for a Period Certain or Joint and Last      
Survivor Life Annuity Payout Option. The risk that we bear during this period is
that the actual mortality rates, in aggregate, may be lower than the expected   
mortality rates.                                                                

- EXPENSE RISK -- We also bear an expense risk that the Annual Maintenance Fee  
 collected before the Annuity Commencement Date may not be enough to cover the
actual cost of selling, distributing and administering the Contract.        

Although variable Annuity Payouts will fluctuate with the performance of the    
underlying Fund selected, your Annuity Payouts will NOT be affected by (a) the  
actual mortality experience of our Annuitants, or (b) our actual expenses if    
they are greater than the deductions stated in the Contract. Because we cannot  
be certain how long our Annuitants will live, we charge this percentage fee     
based on the mortality tables currently in use. The mortality and expense risk  
charge enables us to keep our commitments and to pay you as planned.            

2. ADMINISTRATION FEE                                                           

To cover the costs of administering your Contract, we deduct a daily charge     
which is equal to an annual rate of 0.15% of Sub-Account Value during both the  
accumulation and annuity phases of the Contract. There is not necessarily a     
relationship between the amount of administrative charge deducted for your      
Contract and the amount of expenses that are attributed to your Contract.       

3. ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE                                                       

The Annual Maintenance Fee is a flat fee that is deducted from your Contract    
Value to reimburse us for expenses relating to the administrative maintenance of
the Contract and the Accounts. The annual $30 charge is deducted on a Contract  
Anniversary or when the Contract is fully Surrendered if the Contract Value at  
either of those times is less than $100,000. The charge is deducted             
proportionately from each Account in which you are invested.                    

WHEN IS THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE WAIVED?                                      

We will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee if your Contract Value is $100,000 or  
more on your Contract Anniversary or when you fully Surrender your Contract. We 
reserve the right to waive the Annual Maintenance Fee under certain conditions. 

4. PREMIUM TAXES                                                                

We deduct Premium Taxes, if required, by a state or other government agency.    
Some states collect the taxes when Premium Payments are made; others collect at 
Annuitization. Since we pay Premium Taxes when they are required by applicable  
law, we may deduct them from your Contract when we pay the

taxes, upon Surrender, or on the Annuity Commencement Date. The Premium Tax rate
varies by state or municipality. Currently, the maximum rate charged by any     
state is 3.5% and 4% in Puerto Rico.                                            

5. CHARGES AGAINST THE FUNDS                                                    

The Separate Account purchases shares of the Funds at net asset value. The net  
asset value of the Fund shares reflects investment advisory fees and            
administrative expenses already deducted from the assets of the Funds. These    
charges are described in the Funds' prospectuses accompanying this prospectus.  

OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT CHARGE -- If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we    
will subtract an additional charge on a daily basis which is equal to an annual 
charge of .15% of your Contract Value invested in the Funds.                    

WE MAY OFFER, IN OUR DISCRETION, REDUCED FEES AND CHARGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT    
LIMITED TO THE MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE, AND THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE    
FEE, FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS (INCLUDING EMPLOYER SPONSORED SAVINGS PLANS) WHICH   
MAY RESULT IN DECREASED COSTS AND EXPENSES. REDUCTIONS IN THESE FEES AND CHARGES
WILL NOT BE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST ANY CONTRACT OWNER.                 

DEATH BENEFIT 
WHAT IS THE DEATH BENEFIT AND HOW IS IT CALCULATED?                             

Your Contract has a Death Benefit which is equal to the amounts payable under   
the standard Death Benefit or the Optional Death Benefit. We pay the Death      
Benefit if the Contract Owner, joint owner or Annuitant, die before we begin to 
make annuity payments. The Death Benefit amount will remain invested in the     
Sub-Accounts according to your last instructions and will fluctuate with the    
performance of the underlying Funds. We calculate the Death Benefit as of the   
date we receive a certified death certificate or other legal document acceptable
to us.                                                                          

If you do not elect the Optional Death Benefit, the Death Benefit will be the   
greater of:                                                                     

- the total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any amounts you have     
Surrendered;                                                                

- The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                        

- Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                     

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on Contract  
Anniversaries of Contract Values, Premium Payments and partial Surrenders. We   
will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary prior to the  
deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, whichever is earlier. The Anniversary
Value is equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by 
the dollar amount of any Premium Payments made since that anniversary and       
reduced by the dollar amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary.  
The Maximum Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value        
resulting from this series of calculations.                                     

If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, the Death Benefit will be the greater  
of:                                                                             

- the total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any Surrenders;          

- the Contract Value of your annuity;                                           

- your Maximum Anniversary Value or                                             

- your Interest Accumulation Value.                                             

Assuming you have not taken any Surrenders, your Interest Accumulation Value is 
calculated by accumulating interest on your Premium Payments at a rate of 5% per
year up to the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, whichever is earlier. 
If you have taken any Surrenders, the 5% will be accumulated on your Premium    
Payments, but we will make an adjustment for any of the Surrenders. This        
adjustment will reduce the Death Benefit under the Optional Death Benefit       
proportionally for the Surrenders. The Death Benefit under the Optional Death   
Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of Premium Payments, less proportional  
adjustments for any Surrenders. If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we will
subtract an additional charge on a daily basis which is equal to an annual      
charge of .15% of your Contract Value invested in the Funds.                    

The Optional Death Benefit may not be available if the Contract Owner or        
Annuitant is age 75 or older. The Optional Death Benefit is not available in    
Washington.                                                                     

If you purchase your Contract after September 30, 1999, you must elect the      
Optional Death Benefit at the time you send us your initial Premium Payment.    

HOW IS THE DEATH BENEFIT PAID?                                                  

The Death Benefit may be taken in one lump sum or under any of the Annuity      
Payout Options then being offered by us. On the date we receive complete        
instructions from the Beneficiary, we will compute the Death Benefit amount to  
be paid out or applied to a selected Annuity Payout Option. When there is more  
than one Beneficiary, we will calculate the Death Benefit amount for each       
Beneficiary's portion of the proceeds and then pay it out or apply it to a      
selected Annuity Payout Option according to each Beneficiary's instructions. If 
we receive the complete instructions on a Non-Valuation Day, computations will  
take place on the next Valuation Day.                                           

The Beneficiary may elect, under the Annuity Proceeds Settlement Option, to     
leave proceeds from the Death Benefit with us for up to five years from the date
of the Contract Owner's death if the Contract Owner died before the Annuity     
Commencement Date. Once we receive a certified death certificate or other legal 
document acceptable to us, the Beneficiary can: (a) make Sub-Account transfers  
and (b) take Surrenders.                                                        

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS -- If the Contract Owner dies before the Annuity         
Commencement Date, the Death Benefit must be distributed within five years after
death. The Beneficiary can choose any Annuity Payout Option that results in     
complete Annuity Payout within five years.                                      

P-->49723rd Page of 79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 23rd
HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                   23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date under an   
Annuity Payout Option with a Death Benefit, any remaining value must be         
distributed at least as rapidly as under the payment method being used as of the
Contract Owner's death.                                                         

If the Contract Owner is not an individual (e.g. a trust), then the original    
Annuitant will be treated as the Contract Owner in the situations described     
above and any change in the original Annuitant will be treated as the death of  
the Contract Owner.                                                             

WHAT SHOULD THE BENEFICIARY CONSIDER?                                           

ALTERNATIVES TO THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS -- The selection of an Annuity Payout
Option and the timing of the selection will have an impact on the tax treatment 
of the Death Benefit. To receive favorable tax treatment, the Annuity Payout    
Option selected: (a) cannot extend beyond the Beneficiary's life or life        
expectancy, and (b) must begin within one year of the date of death.            

If these conditions are NOT met, the Death Benefit will be treated as a lump sum
payment for tax purposes. This sum will be taxable in the year in which it is   
considered received.                                                            

SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If the Beneficiary is the Contract Owner's     
spouse, the Beneficiary may elect to continue the Contract as the contract      
owner, receive the death benefit in one lump sum payment or elect an Annuity    
Payout Option. If the Contract continues with the Spouse as Contract Owner, we  
will adjust the Contract Value to the amount that we would have paid as the     
Death Benefit. This spousal continuation is available only once for each        
Contract.                                                                       

WHO WILL RECEIVE THE DEATH BENEFIT?                                             

The distribution of the Death Benefit is based on whether death is before, on or
after the Annuity Commencement Date.

SURRENDERS                                                                      
WHAT KINDS OF SURRENDERS ARE AVAILABLE?                                         

FULL SURRENDERS BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- When you Surrender your 
Contract before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Surrender Value of the       
Contract will be made in a lump sum payment. The Surrender Value is the Contract
Value minus any applicable Premium Taxes and the Annual Maintenance Fee. The    
Surrender Value may be more or less than the amount of the Premium Payments made
to a Contract.                                                                  

PARTIAL SURRENDERS BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may request a    
partial Surrender of Contract Values at any time before the Annuity Commencement
Date. There are two restrictions:                                               

- The partial Surrender amount must be at least equal to $100, our current      
minimum for partial Surrenders, and                                         

- The Contract must have a minimum Contract Value of $500 after the Surrender.  
We reserve the right to close your Contract and pay the full Surrender Value
if the Contract Value is under the minimum after the Surrender. If your     
Contract was issued in Texas, a remaining value of $500 is not required to  
continue the Contract if Premium Payments were made in the last two Contract
Years.                                                                      

FULL SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may Surrender your   
Contract on or after the Annuity Commencement Date only if you selected the     
Payment For a Period Certain Annuity Payout Option. Under this option, we pay   
you the Commuted Value of your Contract. The Commuted Value is determined on the
day we receive your written request for Surrender.                              

PARTIAL SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- Partial Surrenders are
permitted after the Annuity Commencement Date if you elect the Payments for a   
Period Certain Annuity Payout Option, but check with your tax advisor because   
there may be adverse tax consequences.                                          

HOW DO I REQUEST A SURRENDER?                                                   

Requests for full Surrenders must be in writing. Requests for partial Surrenders
can be made in writing or by telephone. We will send your money within seven    
days of receiving complete instructions. However, we may postpone payment of    
Surrenders whenever: (a) the New York Stock Exchange is closed, (b) trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange is restricted by the SEC, (c) the SEC permits and   
orders postponement, or (d) the SEC determines that an emergency exists to      
restrict valuation.                                                             

WRITTEN REQUESTS -- To request a full or partial Surrender, complete a Surrender
Form or send us a letter, signed by you, stating:                               

- the dollar amount that you want to receive, either before or after we withhold
taxes and deduct for any applicable charges,                                

- your tax withholding amount or percentage, if any, and                        

- your mailing address.                                                         

If there are joint Contract Owners, both must authorize all Surrenders. For a   
partial Surrender, specify the Accounts that you want your Surrender to come    
from, otherwise, the Surrender will be taken in proportion to the value in each 
Account.                                                                        

TELEPHONE REQUESTS -- To request a partial Surrender by telephone, we must have 
received your completed Telephone Redemption Program Enrollment Form. If there  
are joint Contract Owners, both must sign this form. By signing the form, you   
authorize us to accept telephone instructions for partial Surrenders from either
Contract Owner. Telephone authorization will remain in effect until we receive a
written cancellation notice from you or your joint Contract Owner, we           
discontinue the program; or you are no longer the owner of the Contract. There  
are some restrictions on telephone surrenders, please call us with any          
questions.                                                                      

We may record telephone calls and use other procedures to verify information and
confirm that instructions are genuine. We will not be liable for losses or      
expenses arising from telephone instructions reasonably believed to be genuine. 
WE MAY MODIFY THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TELEPHONE REDEMPTIONS AT ANY TIME.           

Telephone Surrender instructions received before the close of the New York Stock
Exchange will be processed on that Valuation Day. Otherwise, your request will  
be processed on the next Valuation Day.                                         

COMPLETING A POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO ACT ON YOUR BEHALF MAY
PREVENT YOU FROM MAKING SURRENDERS VIA TELEPHONE.                               
WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ABOUT TAXES?                                          

There are certain tax consequences associated with Surrenders:                  

PRIOR TO AGE 59 1/2 -- If you make a Surrender prior to age 59 1/2, there may be
adverse tax consequences including a 10% federal income tax penalty on the      
taxable portion of the Surrender payment. Surrendering before age 59 1/2 may    
also affect the continuing tax-qualified status of some Contracts.              

WE DO NOT MONITOR SURRENDER REQUESTS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SURRENDER IS       
PERMISSIBLE, WITH OR WITHOUT FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTY, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR    
PERSONAL TAX ADVISER.                                                           

MORE THAN ONE CONTRACT ISSUED IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR -- If you own more than 
one contract issued by us or our affiliates in the same calendar year, then     
these contracts may be treated as one contract for the purpose of determining   
the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Please    
consult your tax adviser for additional information.                            

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 403(b) ANNUITIES -- As of December 31, 1988, all  
section 403(b) annuities have limits on full and partial Surrenders.            
Contributions to your Contract made after December 31, 1988 and any increases in
cash value after December 31, 1988 may not be distributed unless you are: (a)   
age 59 1/2, (b) no longer employed, (c) deceased, (d) disabled, or

distributed for hardships prior to age 59 1/2). Distributions prior to age      
59 1/2 due to financial hardship; unemployment or retirement may still be       
subject to a penalty tax of 10%.                                                

WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER BEFORE MAKING ANY   
SURRENDERS. PLEASE SEE THE "FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS" SECTION FOR MORE        
INFORMATION.                                                                    
ANNUITY PAYOUTS                                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BEGIN TO MAKE REGULAR ANNUITY       
PAYOUTS FROM YOUR CONTRACT. YOU, AS THE CONTRACT OWNER, SHOULD ANSWER FIVE      
QUESTIONS:                                                                      

- When do you want Annuity Payouts to begin?                                    

- Which Annuity Payout Option do you want to use?                               

- How often do you want to receive Annuity Payouts?                             

- What level of Assumed Investment Return should you choose?                    

- Do you want Annuity Payouts to be fixed or variable or a combination?         

Please check with your financial advisor to select the Annuity Payout Option    
that best meets your income needs.                                              

1.  WHEN DO YOU WANT ANNUITY PAYOUTS TO BEGIN?                                  

You select an Annuity Commencement Date when you purchase your Contract or at   
any time before you begin receiving Annuity Payouts. You may change the Annuity 
Commencement Date by notifying us within thirty days prior to the date. The     
Annuity Commencement Date cannot be deferred beyond the Annuitant's 90th        
birthday or the end of the 10th Contract Year, whichever is later unless you    
elect a later date to begin redeeming payments subject to the laws and          
regulations then in effect and our approval. If this Contract is issued to the  
trustee of a Charitable Remainder Trust, the Annuity Commencement Date may be   
deferred to the Annuitant's 100th birthday.                                     

The Annuity Calculation Date is when the amount of your Annuity Payout is       
determined. This occurs within five Valuation Days before your selected Annuity 
Commencement Date.                                                              

All Annuity Payouts, regardless of frequency, will occur on the same day of the 
month as the Annuity Commencement Date. After the initial payout, if an Annuity 
Payout date falls on a Non-Valuation Day, the Annuity Payout is computed on the 
prior Valuation Day. If the Annuity Payout date does not occur in a given month 
due to a leap year or months with only 28 days (i.e. the 31st), the Annuity     
Payout will be computed on the last Valuation Day of the month.                 

2.  WHICH ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION DO YOU WANT TO USE?                             

Your Contract contains the Annuity Payout Options described below. The Annuity  
Proceeds Settlement Option is an option that can be elected by the Beneficiary  
after the death of the Contract Owner and is described in the "Death Benefit"   
section. We may at times offer other Annuity Payout Options. Once we begin to   
make Annuity Payouts, the Annuity Payout Option cannot be changed.              

LIFE ANNUITY                                                                    

We make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living. When the Annuitant  
dies, we stop making Annuity Payouts. A Payee would receive only one Annuity    
Payout if the Annuitant dies after the first payout, two Annuity Payouts if the 
Annuitant dies after the second payout, and so forth.                           

LIFE ANNUITY WITH A CASH REFUND                                                 

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living. When the       
Annuitant dies, if the Annuity Payouts already made are less than the Contract  
Value minus any Premium Tax, the remaining value will be paid to the            
Beneficiary. The remaining value is equal to the Contract Value minus any       
Premium Tax minus the Annuity Payouts already made. This option is only         
available for Annuity Payouts using the 5% Assumed Investment Return.           

LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN -- We will make Annuity Payouts 
as long as the Annuitant is living, but we at least guarantee to make Annuity   
Payouts for a time period you select, between 5 years and 100 years minus the   
Annuitant's age. If the Annuitant dies before the guaranteed number of years    
have passed, then the Beneficiary may elect to (a) continue Annuity Payouts for 
the remainder of the guaranteed number of years or (b) receive the Commuted     
Value in one sum.                                                               

For Qualified Contracts, the guaranteed number of years must be less than the   
life expectancy of the Annuitant at the time the Annuity Payouts begin. We      
compute life expectancy using the IRS mortality tables.                         

JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY                                            

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant and Joint Annuitant are   
living. When one Annuitant dies, we continue to make Annuity Payouts to the     
other Annuitant until that second Annuitant dies. When choosing this option, you
must decide what will happen to the Annuity Payout after the first Annuitant    
dies. You must select Annuity Payouts that:                                     

- Remain the same at 100%, or                                                   

- Decrease to 66.67%, or                                                        

- Decrease to 50%.                                                              

For variable-dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent Annuity 
Units. For fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payouts, the percentages represent actual
dollar amounts. The percentage will also impact the Annuity Payout amount we pay
while both Annuitants are living. If you pick a lower percentage, your original 
Annuity Payouts will be higher while both Annuitants are alive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN         

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as either the Annuitant or Joint Annuitant 
are living, but we at least guarantee to make Annuity Payouts for a time period 
you select, between 5 years and 100 years minus the Annuitant's age. If the     
Annuitant and the Joint Annuitant both die before the guaranteed number of years
have passed, then the Beneficiary has two options, (a) continue Annuity Payouts 
for the remainder of the guaranteed number of years or (b) receive the Commuted 
Value in one sum.                                                               

When choosing this option, you must decide what will happen to the Annuity      
Payouts after the first Annuitant dies. You must select Annuity Payouts that:   

- Remain the same at 100%, or                                                   

- Decrease to 66.67%, or                                                        

- Decrease to 50%.                                                              

For variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent Annuity 
Units. For fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent     
actual dollar amounts. The percentage will also impact the Annuity Payout amount
we pay while both Annuitants are living. If you pick a lower percentage, your   
original Annuity Payouts will be higher while both Annuitants are alive.        

PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN                                                   

We will make Annuity Payouts for the number of years that you select. You can   
select between 5 years and 30 years.                                            

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:                                                          
- YOU CANNOT SURRENDER YOUR CONTRACT ONCE ANNUITY PAYOUTS BEGIN, UNLESS YOU HAVE
SELECTED THE PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION.           

- For Non-Qualified Contracts, if you do not elect an Annuity Payout Option,    
fixed Annuity Payouts will automatically begin on the Annuity Commencement  
  Date under the Payments for a Period Certain Annuity Payout Option using a ten
year period certain.                                                        

- For Qualified Contracts and Contracts issued in Texas, if you do not elect an 
Annuity Payout Option, fixed Annuity Payouts will begin automatically on the
Annuity Commencement Date, under the Life Annuity Payout Option.            

3.  HOW OFTEN DO YOU WANT THE PAYEE TO RECEIVE ANNUITY PAYOUTS?                 

In addition to selecting an Annuity Commencement Date and an Annuity Payout     
Option, you must also decide how often you want the Payee to receive Annuity    
Payouts. You may choose to receive Annuity Payouts:                             

- monthly,                                                                      

- quarterly,                                                                    

- semi-annually, or                                                             

- annually.                                                                     

Once you select a frequency, it cannot be changed. If you do not make a         
selection, the Payee will receive monthly Annuity Payouts. You must select a    
frequency that results in an Annuity Payout of at least $50. If the amount falls
below $50, we have the right to change the frequency to bring the Annuity Payout
up to at least $50.                                                             

4.  WHAT LEVEL OF ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN DO YOU PREFER?                      

The Assumed Investment Return ("AIR") is the investment return you select before
we start to make Annuity Payouts. It is a critical assumption for calculating   
variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts. The first Annuity Payout will be based  
upon the AIR. The remaining Annuity Payouts will fluctuate based on the         
performance of the underlying Funds.                                            

Subject to the approval of your State, you can select one of three AIRs: 3%, 5% 
or 6%. The greater the AIR, the greater the initial Annuity Payout. A higher AIR
may result in smaller potential growth in the Annuity Payouts. On the other     
hand, a lower AIR results in a lower initial Annuity Payout, but future Annuity 
Payouts have the potential to be greater.                                       

For example, if the second monthly Annuity Payout is the same as the first, the 
sub-accounts earned exactly the same return as the AIR. If the second monthly   
Annuity Payout is more than the first, the sub-accounts earned more than the    
AIR. If the second Annuity Payout is less than the first, the sub-account earned
less than the AIR.                                                              

Level variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts would be produced if the investment
returns remained constant and equal to the AIR. In fact, Annuity Payouts will   
vary up or down as the investment rate varies up or down from the AIR.          

5.  DO YOU WANT FIXED-DOLLAR AMOUNT OR VARIABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS OR
A COMBINATION OF BOTH?                                                  

You may choose an Annuity Payout Option with fixed-dollar amounts,              
variable-dollar amounts or a combination depending on your income needs.        

FIXED-DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- Once a fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payout
begins, you cannot change your selection to receive variable-dollar amount      
Annuity Payout. You will receive equal fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payouts      
throughout the Annuity Payout period. Fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payout amounts
are determined by multiplying the Contract Value, minus any applicable Premium  
Taxes, by an Annuity rate. The annuity rate is set by us and is not less than   
the rate specified in the fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payout Option tables in   
your Contract.                                                                  

VARIABLE-DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- A variable-dollar amount Annuity      
Payout is based on the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts. The          
variable-dollar amount Annuity Payouts may fluctuate with the performance of the
underlying Funds. To begin making variable-dollar amount Annuity Payouts, we    
convert the first Annuity Payout amount to a set

number of Annuity Units and then price those units to determine the Annuity     
Payout amount. The number of Annuity Units that determines the Annuity Payout   
amount remains fixed unless you transfer units between Sub-Accounts.            

The dollar amount of the first variable Annuity Payout depends on:              

- the Annuity Payout Option chosen,                                             

- the Annuitant's attained age and gender (if applicable), and,                 

- the applicable annuity purchase rates based on the 1983a Individual Annuity   
Mortality table                                                             

- the Assumed Investment Return                                                 

The total amount of the first variable-dollar amount Annuity Payout is          
determined by dividing the Contract Value minus any applicable Premium Taxes, by
$1,000 and multiplying the result by the payment factor defined in the Contract 
for the selected Annuity Payout Option.                                         

The dollar amount of each subsequent variable-dollar amount Annuity Payout is   
equal to the total of:                                                          

Annuity Units for each Sub-Account multiplied by Annuity Unit Value for each    
Sub-Account.                                                                    

The Annuity Unit Value of each Sub-Account for any Valuation Period is equal to 
the Accumulation Unit Value Net Investment Factor for the current Valuation     
Period multiplied by the Annuity Unit factor, multiplied by the Annuity Unit    
Value for the preceding Valuation Period.                                       

COMBINATION ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- You may choose to receive a combination of       
fixed-dollar amount and variable-dollar amount annuity payouts as long as they  
total 100% of your Annuity Payout. For example, you may choose to receive 40%   
fixed-dollar amount and 60% variable-dollar amount to meet your income needs.   

TRANSFER OF ANNUITY UNITS -- After the Annuity Calculation Date, you may        
transfer dollar amounts of Annuity Units from one Sub-Account to another. On the
day you make a transfer, the dollar amounts are equal for both Sub-Accounts and 
the number of Annuity Units will be different. We will transfer the dollar      
amount of your Annuity Units the day we receive your written request if received
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Otherwise, the transfer will be
made on the next Valuation Day.

AUTOMATIC ADDITIONS -- Automatic Additions is an electronic transfer program    
that allows you to have money automatically transferred from your checking or   
savings account, and invested in your Contract. It is available for Premium     
Payments made after your initial Premium Payment. The minimum amount for each   
transfer is $50. You can elect to have transfers occur either monthly or        
quarterly, and they can be made into any Account available in your Contract.    

AUTOMATIC INCOME PROGRAM -- The Automatic Income Program allows you to Surrender
a percentage of your total Premium Payments each Contract Year. We can Surrender
from the Accounts you select systematically on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual,
or annual basis. The Automatic Income Program may change based on your          
instructions after your seventh Contract Year.                                  

ASSET REBALANCER -- Asset Rebalancer is a program that allows you to choose a   
customized allocation for your Sub-Accounts to help you reach your investment   
goals. Over time, Sub-Account performance may cause your Contract's allocation  
percentages to change, but under Asset Rebalancer, your Sub-Account allocations 
are rebalanced to the percentages you have chosen. You can only participate in  
one model at a time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASSIGNMENT -- Ownership of this Contract is generally assignable. However, if   
the Contract is issued to a tax qualified retirement plan, it is possible that  
the ownership of the Contract may not be transferred or assigned. An assignment 
of a Non-Qualified Contract may subject the Contract Values or Surrender Value  
to income taxes and certain penalty taxes.                                      

CONTRACT MODIFICATION -- The Annuitant may not be changed. However, if the      
Annuitant is still living, the Contingent Annuitant may be changed at any time  
prior to the Annuity Commencement Date by sending us written notice. We may     
modify the Contract, but no modification will affect the amount or term of any  
Contract unless a modification is required to conform the Contract to applicable
Federal or State law. No modification will effect the method by which Contract  
Values are determined.

dealers that have entered into distribution agreements with HSD.                

Commissions will be paid by Hartford and will not be more than 7% of Premium    
Payments. From time to time, Hartford may pay or permit other promotional       
incentives, in cash or credit or other compensation.                            

Broker-dealers or financial institutions are compensated according to a schedule
set forth by HSD and any applicable rules or regulations for variable insurance 
compensation. Compensation is generally based on Premium Payments made by       
policyholders or Contract Owners. This compensation is usually paid from the    
sales charges described in this prospectus.                                     

In addition, a broker-dealer or financial institution may also receive          
additional compensation for, among other things, training, marketing or other   
services provided. HSD, its affiliates or Hartford may also make compensation   
arrangements with certain broker-dealers or financial institutions based on     
total sales by the broker-dealer or financial institution of insurance products.
These payments, which may be different for different broker-dealers or financial
institutions, will be made by HSD, its affiliates or Hartford out of their own  
assets and will not affect the amounts paid by the policyholders or Contract    
Owners to purchase, hold or Surrender variable insurance products.

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some of the federal tax consequences which affect these contracts?     

A.  GENERAL                                                                     

Since federal tax law is complex, the tax consequences of purchasing this       
contract will vary depending on your situation. You may need tax or legal advice
to help you determine whether purchasing this contract is right for you.        

Our general discussion of the tax treatment of this contract is based on our    
understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted. A   
detailed description of all federal income tax consequences regarding the       
purchase of this contract cannot be made in the prospectus. We also do not      
discuss state, municipal or other tax laws that may apply to this contract. For 
detailed information, you should consult with a qualified tax adviser familiar  
with your situation.                                                            

B.  TAXATION OF HARTFORD AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT                               

The Separate Account is taxed as part of Hartford which is taxed as a life      
insurance company in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as      
amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, the Separate Account will not be taxed as a  
"regulated investment company" under subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.     
Investment income and any realized capital gains on the assets of the Separate  
Account are reinvested and are taken into account in determining the value of   
the Accumulation and Annuity Units (See "Value of Accumulation Units"). As a    
result, such investment income and realized capital gains are automatically     
applied to increase reserves under the Contract.                                

No taxes are due on interest, dividends and short-term or long-term capital     
gains earned by the Separate Account with respect to Qualified or Non-Qualified 
Contracts.                                                                      

C.  TAXATION OF ANNUITIES -- GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING PURCHASERS OTHER THAN 
QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS                                                      

Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities in general.            

1. NON-NATURAL PERSONS, CORPORATIONS, ETC.                                    

Code Section 72 contains provisions for contract owners which are not natural   
persons. Non-natural persons include corporations, trusts, limited liability    
companies, partnerships and other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
types of legal entities. The tax rules for contracts owned by non-natural       
persons are different from the rules for contracts owned by individuals. For    
example, the annual net increase in the value of the contract is currently      
includible in the gross income of a non-natural person, unless the non-natural  
person holds the contract as an agent for a natural person. There are additional
exceptions from current inclusion for:                                          

- certain annuities held by structured settlement companies,                    

- certain annuities held by an employer with respect to a terminated qualified  
retirement plan and                                                         

- certain immediate annuities.                                                  

A non-natural person which is a tax-exempt entity for federal tax purposes will 
not be subject to income tax as a result of this provision.                     

If the contract owner is a non-natural person, the primary annuitant is treated 
as the contract owner in applying mandatory distribution rules. These rules     
require that certain distributions be made upon the death of the contract owner.
A change in the primary annuitant is also treated as the death of the contract  
owner.                                                                          

2. OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS (NATURAL PERSONS).                                   

A Contract Owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the Contract until an
amount is received or deemed received, e.g., in the form of a lump sum payment  
(full or partial value of a Contract) or as Annuity payments under the          
settlement option elected.                                                      

The provisions of Section 72 of the Code concerning distributions are summarized
briefly below. Also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from   
Contracts obtained in a tax-free exchange for other annuity contracts or life   
insurance contracts which were purchased prior to August 14, 1982.              

a. DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.                

i. Total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in
     gross income equal the "investment in the contract" under Section 72 of the
Code.                                                                 

ii. To the extent that the value of the Contract (ignoring any surrender      
charges except on a full surrender) exceeds the "investment in the    
contract," such excess constitutes the "income on the contract."      

iii. Any amount received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement 
  Date (e.g., upon a partial surrender) is deemed to come first from any
     such "income on the contract" and then from "investment in the contract,"
     and for these purposes such "income on the contract" shall be computed by
      reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph 2.c. below. As a result,
  any such amount received or deemed received (1) shall be includable in
gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such
     "income on the contract," and (2) shall not be includable in gross income
to the extent that such amount does exceed any such "income on the  
    contract." If at the time that any amount is received or deemed received
      there is no "income on the contract" (e.g., because the gross value of the
Contract does not exceed the "investment in the contract" and no    
   aggregation rule applies), then such amount received or deemed received
will not be includable in gross income, and will simply reduce the  
"investment in the contract."                                       

 iv. The receipt of any amount as a loan under the Contract or the assignment or
   pledge of any portion of the value of the Contract shall be treated as an
amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a. and the next     
subparagraph b.                                                       

v. In general, the transfer of the Contract, without full and adequate        
 consideration, will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this
subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b. This transfer rule does not
    apply, however, to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident
to divorce.                                                             

b. DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.                       

Annuity payments made periodically after the Annuity Commencement Date are      
includable in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount         
determined by the application of the ratio of the "investment in the contract"  
to the total amount of the payments to be made after the Annuity Commencement   
Date (the "exclusion ratio").                                                   

i. When the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the     
exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the  
   Annuity Commencement Date, any additional payments (including surrenders)
will be entirely includable in gross income.                          

ii. If the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the Annuitant and,
     as of the date of death, the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross
income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the   
     contract as of the Annuity Commencement Date, then the remaining portion of
     unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable
year of the Annuitant.                                                

iii. Generally, nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the     
 Annuity Commencement Date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and
     shall be fully includable in gross income. However, upon a full surrender
after such date, only the excess of the amount received (after any  
      surrender charge) over the remaining "investment in the contract" shall be
 includable in gross income (except to the extent that the aggregation
rule referred to in the next subparagraph c. may apply).            

c. AGGREGATION OF TWO OR MORE ANNUITY CONTRACTS.                        

Contracts issued after October 21, 1988 by the same insurer (or affiliated      
insurer) to the same Contract Owner within the same calendar year (other than   
certain contracts held in connection with a tax-qualified retirement            
arrangement) will be treated as one annuity Contract for the purpose of         
determining the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement     
Date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An annuity contract received in a tax-free exchange for another annuity contract
or life insurance contract may be treated as a new Contract for this purpose.   
Hartford believes that for any annuity subject to such aggregation, the values  
under the Contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added together  
to determine the taxation under subparagraph 2.a., above, of amounts received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Withdrawals will first  
be treated as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all such       
Contracts is withdrawn. As of the date of this prospectus, there are no         
regulations interpreting this provision.                                        

d. 10% PENALTY TAX -- APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN                             
WITHDRAWALS AND ANNUITY PAYMENTS.                                   

i. If any amount is received or deemed received on the Contract (before or  
    after the Annuity Commencement Date), the Code applies a penalty tax equal
 to ten percent of the portion of the amount includable in gross income,
unless an exception applies.                                          

ii. The 10% penalty tax will not apply to the following distributions         
(exceptions vary based upon the precise plan involved):               

  1.  Distributions made on or after the date the recipient has attained the
age of 59 1/2.                                                  

2.  Distributions made on or after the death of the holder or where the 
holder is not an individual, the death of the primary annuitant.

3.  Distributions attributable to a recipient's becoming disabled.      

    4.  A distribution that is part of a scheduled series of substantially equal
      periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) for the life (or
life expectancy) of the recipient (or the joint lives or life   
expectancies of the recipient and the recipient's designated    
Beneficiary).                                                   

  5.  Distributions of amounts which are allocable to the "investment in the
contract" prior to August 14, 1982 (see next subparagraph e.).  

e. SPECIAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING CONTRACTS OBTAINED THROUGH A TAX-FREE   
      EXCHANGE OF OTHER ANNUITY OR LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS PURCHASED PRIOR TO
AUGUST 14, 1982.                                                  

If the Contract was obtained by a tax-free exchange of a life insurance or      
annuity Contract purchased prior to August 14, 1982, then any amount received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date shall be deemed to come  
(1) first from the amount of the "investment in the contract" prior to August   
14, 1982 ("pre-8/14/82 investment") carried over from the prior Contract, (2)   
then from the portion of the "income on the contract" (carried over to, as well 
as accumulating in, the successor Contract) that is attributable to such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, (3) then from the remaining "income on the contract" and
(4) last from the remaining "investment in the contract." As a result, to the   
extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, such amount is not includable in gross income., In      
addition, to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not   
exceed the sum of (a) such pre-8/14/82 investment and (b) the "income on the    
contract" attributable thereto, such amount is not subject to the 10% penalty   
tax. In all other respects, amounts received or deemed received from such post- 
exchange Contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this         
subparagraph 3.                                                                 

f. REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS                                               
i. Death of Contract Owner or Primary Annuitant                             

Subject to the alternative election or spouse beneficiary provisions in ii or   
iii below:                                                                      

     1. If any Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date and
    before the entire interest in the Contract has been distributed, the
   remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as
        rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of
such death;                                                     

 2. If any Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date, the
        entire interest in the Contract will be distributed within 5 years after
such death; and                                                 

   3. If the Contract Owner is not an individual, then for purposes of 1. or
      2. above, the primary annuitant under the Contract shall be treated as
    the Contract Owner, and any change in the primary annuitant shall be
        treated as the death of the Contract Owner. The primary annuitant is the
       individual, the events in the life of whom are of primary importance in
affecting the timing or amount of the payout under the Contract.

ii. Alternative Election to Satisfy Distribution Requirements                 
   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner described in i. above is
   payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, such beneficiary
    may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that does not extend
 beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary. Distributions must
begin within a year of the Contract Owner's death.                      

iii. Spouse Beneficiary                                                       
   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner is payable to or for the
  benefit of his or her spouse, and the Annuitant or Contingent Annuitant is
  living, such spouse shall be treated as the Contract Owner of such portion
    for purposes of section i. above. This spousal continuation shall apply only
once for this contract.                                                 

3. DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.                                              

The Code requires that investments supporting your contract be adequately       
diversified. Code Section 817 provides that a variable annuity contract will not
be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments   
made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified. 
If a contract is not treated as an annuity contract, the contract

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value.          

The Treasury Department's diversification regulations require, among other      
things, that:                                                                   

- no more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset     
account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment,

- no more than 70% is represented by any two investments,                       

- no more than 80% is represented by any three investments and                  

- no more than 90% is represented by any four investments.                      

In determining whether the diversification standards are met, all securities of 
the same issuer, all interests in the same real property project, and all       
interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment. In the 
case of government securities, each government agency or instrumentality is     
treated as a separate issuer.                                                   

A separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on  
the last day of each calendar quarter or within 30 days after the quarter ends. 
If an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification         
requirements, the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid 
the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis. However, either the company
or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which 
the diversification requirements were not met.                                  

We monitor the diversification of investments in the separate accounts and test 
for diversification as required by the Code. We intend to administer all        
contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will     
maintain adequate diversification.                                              

4. OWNERSHIP OF THE ASSETS IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT.                           

In order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral, assets in 
the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by 
the insurance company and not by the contract owner. It is unclear under what   
circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets  
in the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax        
purposes.                                                                       

The IRS has issued several rulings discussing investor control. These rulings   
say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner, such as the      
ability to select and control investments in a separate account, will cause the 
contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes.       

In its explanation of the diversification regulations, the Treasury Department  
recognized that the temporary regulations "do not provide guidance concerning   
the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated  
asset account may cause the investor, rather than the insurance company, to be  
treated as the owner of the assets in the account." The explanation further     
indicates that "the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a   
segregated asset account may include multiple sub-accounts, but do not specify  
the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular    
sub-accounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets.      
Guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue    
rulings under Section 817(d), relating to the definition of variable contract." 

The final regulations issued under Section 817 did not provide guidance         
regarding investor control, and as of the date of this prospectus, guidance has 
yet to be issued. We do not know if additional guidance will be issued. If      
guidance is issued, we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect.        

Due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control, there is some         
uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets   
for tax purposes. We reserve the right to modify the contract, as necessary, to 
prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account.  

D.  FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING                                              

Any portion of a distribution that is (or is deemed to be) current taxable      
income to the Contract Owner will be subject to federal income tax withholding  
and reporting under the Code. Generally, however, a Contract Owner may elect not
to have income taxes withheld or to have income taxes withheld at a different   
rate by filing a completed election form with us. Election forms will be        
provided at the time distributions are requested.                               

E.  GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS                     

The Contract may be used for a number of qualified retirement plans. If the     
Contract is being purchased with respect to some form of qualified retirement   
plan, please refer to Appendix I for information relative to the types of plans 
for which it may be used and the general explanation of the tax features of such
plans.                                                                          

F.  ANNUITY PURCHASES BY NONRESIDENT ALIENS AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS            

The discussion above provides general information regarding U.S. federal income 
tax consequences to annuity purchasers that are U.S. citizens or residents.     
Purchasers that are not U.S. citizens or residents will generally be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax and withholding on annuity distributions at a 30% rate, 
unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, purchasers may be subject to   
state premium tax, other state and/or municipal taxes, and taxes that may be    
imposed by the purchaser's country of citizenship or residence. Prospective     
purchasers are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser regarding U.S.,  
state, and foreign taxation with respect to an annuity purchase.                

G.  GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFERS                                               

Under certain circumstances, the Internal Revenue Code may impose a "generation 
skipping transfer tax" when all or part of an annuity is transferred to, or a   
death benefit is paid to, an individual two or more generations younger than the
owner. Federal tax law may require us to deduct the tax from your contract, or  
from any applicable payment, and pay it directly to the Internal Revenue        
Service.

APPENDIX I -- INFORMATION REGARDING TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS              

This summary does not attempt to provide more than general information about the
federal income tax rules associated with use of a Contract by a tax-qualified   
retirement plan. Because of the complexity of the federal tax rules, owners,    
participants and beneficiaries are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors 
as to specific tax consequences.                                                

The federal tax rules applicable to owners of Contracts under tax-qualified     
retirement plans vary according to the type of plan as well as the terms and    
conditions of the plan itself. Contract owners, plan participants and           
beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights and benefits of any person may be   
controlled by the terms and conditions of the tax-qualified retirement plan     
itself, regardless of the terms and conditions of a Contract. We are not bound  
by the terms and conditions of such plans to the extent such terms conflict with
a Contract, unless we specifically consent to be bound.                         

Some tax-qualified retirement plans are subject to distribution and other       
requirements that are not incorporated into our administrative procedures.      
Contract owners, participants and beneficiaries are responsible for determining 
that contributions, distributions and other transactions comply with applicable 
law. Tax penalties may apply to transactions with respect to tax-qualified      
retirement plans if applicable federal income tax rules and restrictions are not
carefully observed.                                                             

We do not currently offer the Contracts in connection with all of the types of  
tax-qualified retirement plans discussed below and may not offer the Contracts  
for all types of tax-qualified retirement plans in the future.                  

1. TAX-QUALIFIED PENSION OR PROFIT-SHARING PLANS -- Eligible employers can      
establish certain tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans under section  
401 of the Code. Rules under section 401(k) of the Code govern certain "cash or 
deferred arrangements" under such plans. Rules under section 408(k) govern      
"simplified employee pensions". Tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans  
are subject to limitations on the amount that may be contributed, the persons   
who may be eligible to participate and the time when distributions must         
commence. Employers intending to use the Contracts in connection with           
tax-qualified pension or profit-sharing plans should seek competent tax and     
other legal advice.                                                             

2. TAX SHELTERED ANNUITIES UNDER SECTION 403(b) -- Public schools and certain   
types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations, as specified in  
section 501(c)(3) of the Code, can purchase tax-sheltered annuity contracts for 
their employees. Tax-deferred contributions can be made to tax-sheltered annuity
contracts under section 403(b) of the Code, subject to certain limitations.     
Generally, such contributions may not exceed the lesser of $10,500 (indexed) or 
20% of the employee's "includable compensation" for such employee's most recent 
full year of employment, subject to other adjustments. Special provisions under 
the Code may allow some employees to elect a different overall limitation.      

Tax-sheltered annuity programs under section 403(b) are subject to a PROHIBITION
AGAINST DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONTRIBUTIONS MADE      
PURSUANT TO A SALARY REDUCTION AGREEMENT, unless such distribution is made:     

- after the participating employee attains age 59 1/2;                          

- upon separation from service;                                                 

- upon death or disability; or                                                  

- in the case of hardship (and in the case of hardship, any income attributable 
to such contributions may not be distributed).                              

Generally, the above restrictions do not apply to distributions attributable to 
cash values or other amounts held under a section 403(b) contract as of December
31, 1988.                                                                       

3. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER SECTION 457 -- A governmental employer or a
tax-exempt employer other than a governmental unit can establish a Deferred     
Compensation Plan under section 457 of the Code. For these purposes, a          
"governmental employer" is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an   
agency or an instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State.    
Employees and independent contractors performing services for a governmental or 
tax-exempt employer can elect to have contributions made to a Deferred          
Compensation Plan of their employer in accordance with the employer's plan and  
section 457 of the Code.                                                        

Deferred Compensation Plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the 
Code are called "eligible" Deferred Compensation Plans. Section 457(b) limits   
the amount of contributions that can be made to an eligible Deferred            
Compensation Plan on behalf of a participant. Generally, the limitation on      
contributions is 33 1/3% of a participant's includable compensation (typically  
25% of gross compensation) or, for 2000, $8,000 (indexed), whichever is less.   
The plan may provide for additional "catch-up" contributions during the three   
taxable years ending before the year in which the participant attains normal    
retirement age.                                                                 

All of the assets and income of an eligible Deferred Compensation Plan of a     
governmental employer must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of        
participants and their beneficiaries. For this purpose, custodial accounts and  
certain annuity contracts are treated as trusts. The requirement of a trust does
not apply to amounts under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a tax-exempt         
(non-governmental) employer. In addition, the requirement of a trust does not   
apply to amounts under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a governmental employer  
if the Deferred Compensation Plan is not an eligible plan within the meaning of 
section 457(b) of the Code. In the absence of such a trust,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
amounts under the plan will be subject to the claims of the employer's general  
creditors.                                                                      

In general, distributions from an eligible Deferred Compensation Plan are       
prohibited under section 457 of the Code unless made after the participating    
employee:                                                                       

- attains age 70 1/2,                                                           

- separates from service,                                                       

- dies, or                                                                      

- suffers an unforeseeable financial emergency as defined in the Code.          

Under present federal tax law, amounts accumulated in a Deferred Compensation   
Plan under section 457 of the Code cannot be transferred or rolled over on a    
tax-deferred basis except for certain transfers to other Deferred Compensation  
Plans under section 457 in limited cases.                                       

4. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES ("IRAS") UNDER SECTION 408                   

TRADITIONAL IRAS -- Eligible individuals can establish individual retirement    
programs under section 408 of the Code through the purchase of an IRA. Section  
408 imposes limits with respect to IRAs, including limits on the amount that may
be contributed to an IRA, the amount of such contributions that may be deducted 
from taxable income, the persons who may be eligible to contribute to an IRA,   
and the time when distributions commence from an IRA. Distributions from certain
tax-qualified retirement plans may be "rolled-over" to an IRA on a tax-deferred 
basis.                                                                          

SIMPLE IRAS -- Eligible employees may establish SIMPLE IRAs in connection with a
SIMPLE IRA plan of an employer under section 408(p) of the Code. Special        
rollover rules apply to SIMPLE IRAs. Amounts can be rolled over from one SIMPLE 
IRA to another SIMPLE IRA. However, amounts can be rolled over from a SIMPLE IRA
to a Traditional IRA only after two years have expired since the employee first 
commenced participation in the employer's SIMPLE IRA plan. Amounts cannot be    
rolled over to a SIMPLE IRA from a qualified plan or a Traditional IRA. Hartford
is a non-designated financial institution for purposes of the SIMPLE IRA rules. 

ROTH IRAS -- Eligible individuals may establish Roth IRAs under section 408A of 
the Code. Contributions to a Roth IRA are not deductible. Subject to special    
limitations, a Traditional IRA may be converted into a Roth IRA or a            
distribution from a Traditional IRA may be rolled over to a Roth IRA. However, a
conversion or a rollover from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is not excludable 
from gross income. If certain conditions are met, qualified distributions from a
Roth IRA are tax-free.                                                          

5. FEDERAL TAX PENALTIES AND WITHHOLDING -- Distributions from tax-qualified    
retirement plans are generally taxed as ordinary income under section 72 of the 
Code. Under these rules, a portion of each distribution may be excludable from  
income. The excludable amount is the portion of the distribution that bears the 
same ratio as the after-tax contributions bear to the expected return.          

(a) PENALTY TAX ON EARLY DISTRIBUTIONS  Section 72(t) of the Code imposes an    
    additional penalty tax equal to 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution
 from certain tax-qualified retirement plans. However, the 10% penalty tax
does not apply to a distributions that is:                              

- Made on or after the date on which the employee reaches age 59 1/2;           

- Made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the employee) on or after the death
of the employee;                                                            

- Attributable to the employee's becoming disabled (as defined in the Code);    

- Part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the employee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the employee and his or her     
designated beneficiary;                                                     

- Except in the case of an IRA, made to an employee after separation from       
service after reaching age 55; or                                           

- Not greater than the amount allowable as a deduction to the employee for      
eligible medical expenses during the taxable year.                          

In addition, the 10% penalty tax does not apply to a distribution from an IRA   
that is:                                                                        

- Made after separation from employment to an unemployed IRA owner for health   
insurance premiums, if certain conditions are met;                          

- Not in excess of the amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses,  
as defined by section 72(t)(7) of the Code; or                              

- A qualified first-time homebuyer distribution meeting the requirements        
specified at section 72(t)(8) of the Code.                                  

If you are a participant in a SIMPLE IRA plan, you should be aware that the 10% 
penalty tax is increased to 25% with respect to non-exempt early distributions  
made from your SIMPLE IRA during the first two years following the date you     
first commenced participation in any SIMPLE IRA plan of your employer.          

(b) MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX  If the amount distributed is less than the
   minimum required distribution for the year, the Participant is subject to a
50% penalty tax on the amount that was not properly distributed.        

An individual's interest in a tax-qualified retirement plan generally must be   
distributed, or begin to be distributed, not later than the Required Beginning  
Date. Generally, the Required Beginning Date is April 1 of the calendar year    
following the later of:                                                         

- the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70 1/2; or              

- the calendar year in which the individual retires from service with the       
employer sponsoring the plan.

HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                   35
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Required Beginning Date for an individual who is a five (5) percent owner   
(as defined in the Code), or who is the owner of an IRA, is April 1 of the      
calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual attains age   
70 1/2.                                                                         

The entire interest of the Participant must be distributed beginning no later   
than the Required Beginning Date over:                                          

- the life of the Participant or the lives of the Participant and the           
Participant's designated beneficiary, or                                    

- over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Participant or  
 the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's designated
beneficiary.                                                                

Each annual distribution must equal or exceed a "minimum distribution amount"   
which is determined by dividing the account balance by the applicable life      
expectancy. This account balance is generally based upon the account value as of
the close of business on the last day of the previous calendar year. In         
addition, minimum distribution incidental benefit rules may require a larger    
annual distribution.                                                            

If an individual dies before reaching his or her Required Beginning Date, the   
individual's entire interest must generally be distributed within five years of 
the individual's death. However, this rule will be deemed satisfied, if         
distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the         
individual's death to a designated beneficiary and distribution is over the life
of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life  
expectancy of the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is the individual's surviving
spouse, distributions may be delayed until the individual would have attained   
age 70 1/2.                                                                     

If an individual dies after reaching his or her Required Beginning Date or after
distributions have commenced, the individual's interest must generally be       
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at
the time of the individual's death.                                             

(c) WITHHOLDING  In general, regular wage withholding rules apply to            
distributions from IRAs and plans described in section 457 of the Code. 
 Periodic distributions from other tax-qualified retirement plans that are
made for a specified period of 10 or more years or for the life or life 
 expectancy of the participant (or the joint lives or life expectancies of
    the participant and beneficiary) are generally subject to federal income tax
   withholding as if the recipient were married claiming three exemptions. The
recipient of periodic distributions may generally elect not to have     
 withholding apply or to have income taxes withheld at a different rate by
providing a completed election form.                                    

Mandatory federal income tax withholding at a flat rate of 20% will generally   
apply to other distributions from such other tax-qualified retirement plans     
unless such distributions are:                                                  

- the non-taxable portion of the distribution;                                  

- required minimum distributions; or                                            

- direct transfer distributions.                                                

Direct transfer distributions are direct payments to an IRA or to another       
eligible retirement plan under Code section 401(a)(31).                         

Certain states require withholding of state taxes when federal income tax is    
withheld.

engaged in the business of writing life insurance and annuities, both individual

Puerto Rico, except New York. On January 1, 1998, Hartford's name changed from  
ITT Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company to Hartford Life and Annuity    
Insurance Company. We were originally incorporated under the laws of Wisconsin  
on January 9, 1956, and subsequently redomiciled to Connecticut. Our offices are

Hartford, CT 06104-2999. We are ultimately controlled by The Hartford Financial

 CALCULATION OF YIELD AND RETURN

YIELD OF A MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT. As summarized in the Prospectus under the  
heading "Performance Related Information," the yield of a money market          
Sub-Account for a seven day period (the "base period") will be computed by      
determining the "net change in value" (calculated as set forth below) of a      
hypothetical account having a balance of one accumulation unit of the           
Sub-Account at the beginning of the period, subtracting a hypothetical charge   
reflecting deductions from Contract Owner accounts, and dividing the difference 
by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period to obtain the   
base period return, and then multiplying the base period return by (365/7) with 
the resulting yield figure carried to the nearest hundredth of one percent. Net 
changes in value of a hypothetical account will include net investment income of
the account (accrued daily dividends as declared by the underlying funds, less  
daily expense charges of the account) for the period, but will not include      
realized gains or losses or unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the      
underlying fund shares.                                                         

The effective yield is calculated by compounding the base period return by      
adding 1, raising the sum to a power equal to 365 divided by 7 and subtracting 1
from the result, according to the following formula:                            

Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)TO THE POWER OF 365/7] - 1     

A MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT'S YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD WILL VARY IN RESPONSE TO 
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND IN THE EXPENSES OF THE SUB-ACCOUNT. THE      
CURRENT YIELD

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


YIELDS OF SUB-ACCOUNTS. As summarized in the Prospectus under the heading       
"Performance Related Information," yields of Sub-Accounts will be computed by   
annualizing a recent month's net investment income, divided by a Portfolio      
share's net asset value on the last trading day of that month. Net changes in   
the value of a hypothetical account will assume the change in the underlying    
mutual fund's "net asset value per share" for the same period in addition to the
daily expense charge assessed, at the sub-account level for the respective      
period. The Sub-Accounts' yields will vary from time to time depending upon     
market conditions and, the composition of the underlying funds' portfolios.     
Yield should also be considered relative to changes in the value of the         
Sub-Accounts' shares and to the relative risks associated with the investment   
objectives and policies of the underlying Portfolio.                            

THE YIELD REFLECTS RECURRING CHARGES ON THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT LEVEL, INCLUDING   
THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE.                                                     

Yield calculations of the Sub-Accounts used for illustration purposes reflect   
the interest earned by the Sub-Accounts, less applicable asset based charges    
assessed under the Contract over the base period. Yield quotations based on a 30
day period are computed by dividing the dividends and interests earned during   
the period by the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period,
according to the following formula:                                             

Example:                                                                        

Current Yield Formula for the Sub-Account  2[((A-B)/(CD) + 1)TO THE

Where         A = Dividends and interest earned during the period.              
        B = Expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).
        C = The average daily number of units outstanding during the
   period that were entitled to receive dividends.
      D = The maximum offering price per unit on the last day of
the period.

At any time in the future, yields and total return may be higher or lower than  
past yields and there can be no assurance that any historical results will      
continue.                                                                       

CALCULATION OF TOTAL RETURN. As summarized in the Prospectus under the heading  
"Performance Related Information," total return is a measure of the change in   
value of an investment in a Sub-Account over the period covered. The formula for
total return used herein includes three steps: (1) calculating the value of the 
hypothetical initial investment of $1,000 as of the end of the period by        
multiplying the total number of units owned at the end of the period by the unit
value per unit on the last trading day of the period; (2) assuming redemption at
the end of the period and deducting any applicable contingent deferred sales    
charge and (3) dividing this account value for the hypothetical investor by the 
initial $1,000 investment and annualizing the result for periods of less than   
one year. Standardized total return will be calculated since inception of the   
Separate Account for one year, five years and ten years or some other relevant  
periods if a Sub-Account has not been in existence for at least ten years.      

The following are the standardized average annual total return quotations for   
the Sub-Accounts for 1, 5, and 10 year periods. (These returns assume a         
mortality and risk expense charge of 1.50% and an Annual Maintenance Fee of     
$30.)

non-standardized total return. This figure will usually be calculated since the 
inception of the underlying fund for one year, five years, and ten years or     
other periods. Non-standardized total return is measured in the same manner as  
the standardized total return described above, except that the Annual           
Maintenance Fee is not deducted. Therefore, non-standardized total return for a 
Sub-Account is higher than standardized total return for a Sub-Account.         

The following are the non-standardized annualized total return quotations for   
the Sub-Accounts for 1, 5, and 10 year periods. (These returns assume a         
mortality and risk expense charge of 1.50%.)

return in advertisements or in information furnished to present or prospective  
shareholders. Each Sub-Account may from time to time include its yield and total
return in advertisements or information furnished to present or prospective

its total return (and yield in the case of certain Sub-Accounts) the ranking of 
those performance figures relative to such figures for groups of other annuities

The total return and yield may also be used to compare the performance of the   
Sub-Accounts against certain widely acknowledged outside standards or indices   
for stock and bond market performance. The Standard & Poor's Composite Index of 
500 Stocks (the "S&P 500") is a market value-weighted and unmanaged index       
showing the changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks relative to the 
base period 1941-43. The S&P 500 is composed almost entirely of common stocks of
companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the common stocks of a
few companies listed on the American Stock Exchange or traded over-the-counter  
are included. The 500 companies represented include about 400 industrial, 60    
transportation and 40 financial services concerns. The S&P 500 represents about 
80% of the market value of all issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange.    

The NASDAQ-OTC Composite Price Index (The "NASDAQ Index") is a market           
value-weighted and unmanaged index showing the changes in the aggregate market  
value of approximately 3,500 stocks relative to the base measure of 100.00 on   
February 5, 1971. The NASDAQ Index is composed entirely of common stocks of     
companies traded over-the-counter and often through the National Association of 
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations ("NASDAQ") system. Only those           
over-the-counter stocks having only one market maker or traded on exchanges are 
excluded.                                                                       

The Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE Index (the "EAFE Index") is an    
unmanaged index, which includes over 1,000 companies representing the stock     
markets of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East. The EAFE Index is  
weighted by market capitalization, and therefore, it has a heavy representation 
in countries with large stock markets, such as Japan.                           

The Shearson Lehman Government Bond Index (the "SL Government Index") is a      
measure of the market value of all public obligations of the U.S. Treasury; all 
publicly issued debt of all agencies of the U.S. Government and all             
quasi-federal corporations; and all corporate debt guaranteed by the U.S.       
Government. Mortgage-backed securities, flower bonds and foreign targeted issues
are not included in the SL Government Index.                                    

The Shearson Lehman Government/Corporate Bond Index (the "SL                    
Government/Corporate Index") is a measure of the market value of approximately  
5,300 bonds with a face value currently in excess of $1.3 trillion. To be       
included in the SL Government/Corporate Index, an issue must have amounts       
outstanding in excess of $1 million, have at least one year to maturity and be  
rated "Baa" or higher ("investment grade") by a nationally recognized rating    
agency.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT THREE AND TO THE OWNERS OF UNITS OF INTEREST THEREIN:          

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of        
Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company Separate Account Three (Money       
Market, North American Government Securities, Balanced Growth, Utilities,       
Dividend Growth, Value-Added Market, Growth, American Opportunities, Global

sub-accounts), (collectively, the Account) as of December 31, 1999, and the     
related statements of operations and the statements of changes in net assets for
the periods presented. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Account's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these      
financial statements based on our audits.                                       

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by      
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.          

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of the Account as of December 31,
1999, and the results of its operations and the changes in its net assets for   
the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting          
principles.

HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY                                     
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 1999 
1.  ORGANIZATION:                                                             

    Separate Account Three (the Account) is a separate investment account within
   Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (the Company) and is registered
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a unit investment trust
  under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Both the Company and
  the Account are subject to supervision and regulation by the Department of
Insurance of the State of Connecticut and the SEC. The Account invests  
    deposits by variable annuity contractowners of the Company in various mutual
funds (the Funds) as directed by the contractowners.                    

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:                                          

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the    
Account, which are in accordance with generally accepted accounting     
principles in the investment company industry:                          

a)  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS--Security transactions are recorded on the trade
  date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains and
       losses on the sales of securities are computed on the basis of identified
cost of the fund shares sold. Dividend and capital gains income is
 accrued as of the ex-dividend date. Capital gains income represents
     dividends from the Funds which are characterized as capital gains under
tax regulations.                                                  

  b)  SECURITY VALUATION--The investments in shares of the Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, the Van Kampen Life   
   Investment Trust, and the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Universal Funds,
       Inc. are valued at the closing net asset value per share as determined by
the appropriate Fund as of December 31, 1999.                     

c)  UNIT TRANSACTIONS--Unit transactions are executed based on the unit   
values calculated at the close of the business day.               

 d)  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES--The operations of the Account form a part of, and
       are taxed with, the total operations of the Company, which is taxed as an
      insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code. Under current law, no
    Federal income taxes are payable with respect to the operations of the
Account.                                                          

 e)  USE OF ESTIMATES--The preparation of financial statements in conformity
       with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
      estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported
    amounts of income and expenses during the period. Operating results in
the future could vary from the amounts derived from management's  
estimates.                                                        

3.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACCOUNT AND RELATED CHARGES:                        

a)  MORTALITY AND EXPENSE UNDERTAKINGS--The Company, as issuer of variable
     annuity contracts, provides the mortality and expense undertakings and,
       with respect to the Account, receives a maximum annual fee of up to 1.50%
  of the Account's average daily net assets. The Company also provides
administrative services and receives an annual fee of 0.15% of the
Account's average daily net assets.                               

   b)  DEDUCTION OF ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE--Annual maintenance fees are deducted
       through termination of units of interest from applicable contract owners'
    accounts, in accordance with the terms of the contracts. These charges
are reflected in surrenders for benefit payments and fees on the  
accompanying statements of changes in net assets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
----------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors of                                                    
Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company:                                    

We have audited the accompanying statutory balance sheets of Hartford Life and  
Annuity Insurance Company (a Connecticut Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Hartford Life Insurance Company) (the Company) as of December 31, 1999 and   
1998, and the related statutory statements of operations, changes in capital and
surplus, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1999. These statutory financial statements are the responsibility of the    
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these      
statutory financial statements based on our audits.                             

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

The Company presents its financial statements in conformity with statutory      
accounting practices as described in Note 2 of notes to statutory financial     
statements. When financial statements are presented for purposes other than for 
filing with a regulatory agency, auditing standards generally accepted in the   
United States require that an auditors' report on them state whether they are   
presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the    
United States. The accounting practices used by the Company vary from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States as explained and quantified  
in Note 2.                                                                      

In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter discussed in the preceding 
paragraph, the statutory financial statements referred to above do not present  
fairly, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the      
United States, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, or the results of its operations or its cash flows for each of the three  
years in the period ended December 31, 1999.                                    

In our opinion, the statutory financial statements referred to above present    
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of   
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity 
with statutory accounting practices as described in Note 2.                     

Hartford, Connecticut

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
(STATUTORY BASIS)

(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:                                    

Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (the "Company") is a wholly owned   
subsidiary of Hartford Life Insurance Company ("HLIC"), which is an indirect    
subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI"). HLI is indirectly majority owned by  
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("The Hartford"). On February 10,
1997, HLI filed a registration statement, as amended, with the Securities and   
Exchange Commission relating to the initial public offering of HLI Class A      
Common Stock (the "Offering"). Pursuant to the Offering on May 22, 1997, HLI    
sold to the public 26 million shares, representing approximately 18.6% of the   
equity ownership of HLI.                                                        

In 1998, the Company changed its name to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance    
Company from ITT Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company.                   

The Company offers a complete line of fixed and variable annuities, as well as  
variable, universal and traditional individual life insurance.                  

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:                                  
BASIS OF PRESENTATION                                                           

The accompanying statutory basis financial statements of the Company were       
prepared in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or        
permitted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and   
the State of Connecticut Department of Insurance. Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year    
presentation.                                                                   

Current prescribed statutory accounting practices include accounting            
publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general        
administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass        
accounting practices approved by state insurance departments. The Company does  
not follow any permitted statutory accounting practices that have a material    
effect on statutory surplus, statutory net income or risk-based capital.        

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets  
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could      
differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates include those used  
in determining the liability for aggregate reserves for future benefits and the 
liability for premium and other deposit funds. Although some variability is     
inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are       
adequate.                                                                       

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES VERSUS GAAP                                      

Statutory accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles     
("GAAP") differ in certain significant respects. These differences principally  
involve:                                                                        

(1) treatment of policy acquisition costs (commissions, underwriting and selling
expenses, etc.) which are charged to expense when incurred for statutory
 purposes rather than on a pro-rata basis over the expected life and gross
profit stream of the policy for GAAP purposes;                          

(2) recognition of premium revenues, which for statutory purposes are generally 
 recorded as collected or when due during the premium paying period of the
contract and which for GAAP purposes, for universal life policies and   
 investment products, generally only consist of charges assessed to policy
account balances for cost of insurance, policy administration and       
  surrenders. When policy charges received relate to coverage or services to
be provided in the future, the charges are recognized as revenue on a   
    pro-rata basis over the expected life and gross profit stream of the policy.
 Also, for GAAP purposes, premiums for traditional life insurance policies
are recognized as revenues when they are due from policyholders;        

(3) development of liabilities for future policy benefits, which for statutory  
purposes predominantly use interest rate and mortality assumptions      
prescribed by the NAIC which may vary considerably from interest and    
mortality assumptions used under GAAP;                                  

(4) providing for income taxes based on current taxable income only for         
statutory purposes, rather than establishing additional assets or       
 liabilities for deferred Federal income taxes to recognize the tax effect
related to reporting revenues and expenses in different periods for     
financial reporting and tax return purposes or required under GAAP;     

(5) excluding certain assets designated as non-admitted assets (e.g., negative  
Interest Maintenance Reserve, and past due agents' balances) from the   
balance sheet for statutory purposes by directly charging surplus;      

(6) the calculation of post retirement benefits obligation which, for statutory 
    accounting, excludes non-vested employees whereas GAAP liabilities include a
 provision for such employees; statutory and GAAP accounting permit either
   immediate recognition of the liability or straight-line amortization of the
liability over a period not to exceed 20 years. For GAAP, The Hartford's
    obligation was immediately recognized, whereas for statutory accounting, the
obligation is being recognized ratably over a 20 year period;

(7) establishing a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to    
default and equity risk associated with certain invested assets (Asset  
Valuation Reserve) for statutory purposes; as well as the deferral and  
amortization of realized gains and losses, caused by changes in interest
 rates during the period the asset is held, into income over the remaining
life to maturity of the asset sold (Interest Maintenance Reserve) for   
statutory purposes; whereas on a GAAP basis, no such formula reserve is 
required and realized gains and losses are recognized in the period the 
asset is sold;                                                          

(8) the reporting of reserves and benefits net of reinsurance ceded for         
   statutory purposes; whereas on a GAAP basis, reserves are reported gross of
reinsurance with reserve credits presented as recoverable assets;       

(9) the reporting of fixed maturities at amortized cost for statutory purposes, 
whereas GAAP requires that fixed maturities be classified as            
"held-to-maturity," "available-for-sale" or "trading," based on the     
Company's intentions with respect to the ultimate disposition of the    
security and its ability to affect those intentions. The Company's bonds
    were classified on a GAAP basis as available-for-sale and accordingly, those
investments and common stocks were reflected at fair value with the     
corresponding impact included as a separate component of Stockholder's  
  Equity; as well as the change in the basis of the Company's other invested
    assets, which consist primarily of limited partnership investments, which is
  recognized as income under GAAP and as a change in surplus under statutory
accounting; and                                                         

(10) statutory accounting calculates separate account liabilities using         
 prescribed actuarial methodologies, which approximate the market value of
separate account assets less applicable surrender charges. The separate 
account surplus generated by these reserving methods is recorded as an  
 amount due to or from the separate account on the statutory basis balance
   sheet, with changes reflected in the statutory basis results of operations.
 On a GAAP basis, separate account assets and liabilities are held at fair
value.                                                                  

As of and for the years ended December 31, the significant differences between  
Statutory and GAAP basis net income and capital and surplus for the Company are 
as follows:

AGGREGATE RESERVES FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND LIABILITY FOR PREMIUM AND OTHER      
DEPOSIT FUNDS                                                                   

Aggregate reserves for payment of future life, health and annuity benefits were 
computed in accordance with applicable actuarial standards. Reserves for life   
insurance policies are generally based on the 1958 and 1980 Commissioner's      
Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables and various valuation rates ranging from 2.5%
to 6%. Accumulation and on-benefit annuity reserves are based principally on    
individual annuity tables at various rates ranging from                         

2.5% to 8.75% and using the Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method      
("CARVM").                                                                      
The Company has established separate accounts to segregate the assets and       
liabilities of certain life insurance and annuity contracts that must be        
segregated from the Company's general assets under the terms of its contracts.  
The assets consist primarily of marketable securities and are reported at market
value. Premiums, benefits and expenses of these contracts are reported in the   
statutory basis statements of operations.                                       

An analysis of Annuity Actuarial Reserves and Deposit Liabilities by Withdrawal 
Characteristics as of December 31, 1999 (including general and separate account 
liabilities) is as follows:

INVESTMENTS                                                                     

Investments in bonds are carried at amortized cost. Bonds that are deemed       
ineligible to be held at amortized cost by the NAIC Securities Valuation Office 
("SVO") are carried at the appropriate SVO published value. When a reduction in 
the value of a security is deemed to be unrecoverable, the decline in value is  
reported as a realized loss and the carrying value is adjusted accordingly.     
Short-term investments consist of money market funds and are stated at cost,    
which approximates fair value. Common stocks are carried at fair value with the 
current year change in the difference from cost reflected in surplus. Mortgage  
loans, which are carried at cost and approximate fair value, include investments
in assets backed by mortgage loan pools. Other invested assets are generally    
recorded at fair value.                                                         

The Asset Valuation Reserve ("AVR") is designed to provide a standardized       
reserving process for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity  
risks associated with invested assets. The AVR balances were $4,935 and $21,782 
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Additionally, the Interest      
Maintenance Reserve ("IMR") captures net realized capital gains and losses, net 
of applicable income taxes, resulting from changes in interest rates and        
amortizes these gains or losses into income over the life of the bond or        
mortgage sold. The IMR balance as of December 31, 1999 is an asset balance of   
$981 and is reflected as a component of non-admitted assets in Unassigned Funds 
in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The IMR balance as of        
December 31, 1998 is a liability balance of $452 and is reflected as an other   
liability. The net capital (losses) gains transferred to the IMR in 1999, 1998  
and 1997 were $(1,255), $852 and $(719), respectively. The amount of income     
(expense) amortized from the IMR in 1999, 1998 and 1997 included in the         
Company's Statements of Operations, was $178, $(207), and $(85), respectively.  
Realized capital gains and losses, net of taxes, not included in the IMR are    
reported in the statutory basis statements of operations. Realized investment   
gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.             

CODIFICATION                                                                    

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles in March   
1998. The proposed effective date for this statutory accounting guidance is     
January 1, 2001. It is expected that Connecticut, the Company's domiciliary     
state, will adopt these accounting standards and, therefore, the Company will   
make the necessary accounting and reporting changes required for implementation.
The Company has not yet determined the impact that these new accounting         
standards will have on its statutory basis financial statements.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of   
each class of financial instruments: fair value of bonds, short-term            
investments, common stock, and other invested assets approximate those          
quotations published by the NAIC; policy loans and mortgage loans carrying      
amounts approximates fair value; and fair value of liabilities on deposit funds 
and other benefits is determined by forecasting future cash flows and           
discounting the forecasted cash flows at current market rates.                  

4. REINSURANCE:                                                                 
The Company cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum     
losses. Such transfer does not relieve the Company of its primary liability to  
the policyholder. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result 
in losses to the Company. The Company reduces this risk by evaluating the       
financial condition of reinsurers and monitoring for possible concentrations of 
credit risk.                                                                    

The Company cedes significant portions of its variable annuity business written 
since 1994 to RGA Reinsurance Company ("RGA"). Certain core annuity products    
were excluded from this reinsurance arrangement beginning in the second quarter 
of 1999 and, as such, the amounts ceded to RGA have declined significantly.     

In 1995, The Hartford was "spun-off" from ITT Industries, Inc. and became its   
own, autonomous entity. In conjunction with this spin-off, the assets and       
liabilities of Lyndon Insurance Company (Lyndon) were merged into the Company.  
The statutory net assets contributed to the Company as a result of this         
transaction were approximately $112 million and were reflected as an increase in
Gross Paid-In and Contributed Surplus at December 31, 1995. This amount was     
approximately $41 million lower than the value of net assets contributed on a   
GAAP basis.                                                                     

The majority of the business written in Lyndon was assumed from an unaffiliated 
insurer. In 1998, this unaffiliated insurer recaptured the inforce blocks of    
business it had been ceding to the Company through Lyndon. In conjunction with  
this commutation transaction, the Company transferred statutory basis reserves  
of $26,404. Additionally, the Company received fair value consideration for the 
bonds it transferred which exceeded the statutory statement value of these      
assets by $25,622. As a result of this activity, the Company recognized a       
pre-tax gain from this transaction of $52,026 in its 1998 Statements of         
Operations.                                                                     

There were no material reinsurance recoverables from reinsurers outstanding as  
of and for the years ended, December 31, 1999 and 1998.

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:                                                  

Transactions between the Company and its affiliates, relate principally to tax  
settlements, reinsurance, insurance coverages, rental and service fees, capital 
contributions and payments of dividends. In addition, certain affiliated        
insurance companies purchased group annuity contracts from the Company to fund  
pension costs and claim annuities to settle casualty claims. Substantially all  
general insurance expenses related to the Company, including rent and benefit   
plan expenses, are initially paid by The Hartford. Direct expenses are allocated
using specific identification and indirect expenses are allocated using other   
applicable methods. Indirect expenses include those for corporate areas which,  
depending on type, are allocated based on either a percentage of direct expenses
or on utilization.                                                              

The Company has also invested in bonds of its affiliates, Hartford Financial    
Services Corporation and HL Investment Advisors, Inc., and common stock of its  
subsidiary, Hartford Life, LTD.                                                 

For additional information, see Notes 4, 6, and 8.                              

6. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:                                                        
The Company and The Hartford have entered into a tax sharing agreement under    
which each member in the consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return will make  
payments between them such that, with respect to any period, the amount of taxes
to be paid by the Company, subject to certain adjustments, generally will be    
determined as though the Company were filing separate Federal, state and local  
income tax returns.                                                             

As long as The Hartford continues to own at least 80% of the combined voting    
power and 80% of the value of the outstanding capital stock of HLI, the Company 
will be included for Federal income tax purposes in the affiliated group of     
which The Hartford is the common parent. The Hartford and its non-life          
subsidiaries filed a single consolidated Federal income tax return for 1998 and 
1997 and intend to file a separate consolidated Federal income tax return for   
1999. The life insurance companies filed a separate consolidated Federal income 
tax return for 1998 and 1997 and intend to file a separate consolidated Federal 
income tax return for 1999. Federal income taxes (received) paid by the Company 
for operations and capital gains (losses) were $(8,815), $25,780, and $(14,499) 
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The effective tax rate was (73)%, 27%, and
(28)% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

7. CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AND SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS:                   

The maximum amount of dividends which can be paid to shareholders by Connecticut
domiciled insurance companies, without prior approval, is generally restricted  
to the greater of 10% of surplus as of the preceding December 31st or the net   
gain from operations for the previous year. Dividends are paid as determined by 
the Board of Directors and are not cumulative. No dividends were paid in 1999,  
1998 or 1997. The amount available for dividend in 2000 is approximately        
$60,855.                                                                        

8. PENSION, RETIREMENT, AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: 

All employees that work for The Hartford's life insurance companies are included
in The Hartford's non-contributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans   
provide pension benefits that are based on years of service and the employee's  
compensation during the last ten years of employment. The Hartford's funding    
policy is to contribute annually an amount between the minimum funding          
requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,  
as amended, and the maximum amount that can be deducted for U.S. Federal income 
tax purposes. Generally, pension costs are funded through the purchase of group 
pension contracts sold by affiliates. The costs that were allocated to the      
Company for pension related expenses were $762, $1,045 and $840 for 1999, 1998  
and 1997, respectively.                                                         

Employees of The Hartford's life insurance companies are also provided, through 
The Hartford, certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible      
retired employees. The contribution for health care benefits depends on the     
retiree's date of retirement and years of service. In addition, this benefit    
plan has a defined dollar cap, which limits average company contributions. The  
Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care and life insurance          
obligations through trust funds where such prefunding can be accomplished on a  
tax effective basis. Postretirement health care and life insurance benefits     
expense allocated to the Company was not material to the results of operations  
for 1999, 1998 or 1997.                                                         

The assumed rate in the per capita cost of health care (the health care trend   
rate) was 7.1% for 1999, decreasing ratably to 5.0% in the year 2003. Increasing
the health care trend rates by one percent per year would have an immaterial    
impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual      
expense. To the extent that the actual experience differs from the inherent     
assumptions, the effect will be amortized over the average future service of    
covered employees.                                                              

Substantially all of The Hartford's life insurance companies' employees are     
eligible to participate in The Hartford's Investment and Savings Plan. Under    
this plan, designated contributions, which may be invested in Class A Common    
Stock of HLI or certain other investments, are matched to a limit of 3% of      
compensation.                                                                   

9. SEPARATE ACCOUNTS:                                                           
The Company maintains separate account assets totaling $44.9 billion and $32.9  
billion as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Separate account assets 
are segregated from other investments and reported at fair value. Separate      
account liabilities are determined in accordance with prescribed actuarial      
methodologies, which approximate the market value less applicable surrender     
charges. The resulting surplus is recorded in the general account statement of  
operations as a component of Net Transfers to Separate Accounts. The Company's  
separate accounts are non-guaranteed, wherein the policyholder assumes          
substantially all the investment risk and rewards. Investment income (including 
investment gains and losses) and interest credited to policyholders on separate 
account assets are not separately reflected in the statutory statements of      
operations.                                                                     

Separate account management fees, net of minimum guarantees, were $493 million, 
$363 million, and $252 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and are    
recorded as a component of fee income on the Company's statutory basis          
Statements of Operations.

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES:                                     
(a) LITIGATION                                                              
The Company is involved in pending and threatened litigation in the normal      
course of its business in which claims for alleged economic and punitive damages
have been asserted. Some of these cases have been filed as purported class      
actions and some cases have been filed in certain jurisdictions that permit     
punitive damage awards disproportionate to the actual damages incurred. Although
there can be no assurances, at the present time, the Company does not anticipate
that the ultimate liability, arising from such pending or threatened litigation,
will have a material adverse effect on the statutory capital and surplus of the 
Company.                                                                        

(b) GUARANTY FUNDS                                                          

Under insurance guaranty fund laws in each state, the District of Columbia and  
Puerto Rico, insurers licensed to do business can be assessed by state insurance
guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies  
to policyholders and claimants. Recent regulatory actions against certain large 
life insurers encountering financial difficulty have prompted various state     
insurance guaranty associations to begin assessing life insurance companies for 
the deemed losses. Most of these laws do provide, however, that an assessment   
may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer's solvency and       
further provide annual limits on such assessments. Part of the assessments paid 
by the Company pursuant to these laws may be used as credits for a portion of   
the associated premium taxes. The Company paid guaranty fund assessments of     
approximately $523, $1,043 and $1,544 in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, of 
which $318, $995, and $548 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively were estimated  
to be creditable against premium taxes.                                         

(c) TAX MATTERS                                                             
The Company's Federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal  
Revenue Service ("IRS"). The Company's 1997 and 1996 Federal income tax returns 
are currently under audit by the IRS. As of March 31, 2000, the audit was in its
initial stage and no material issues had been raised.
