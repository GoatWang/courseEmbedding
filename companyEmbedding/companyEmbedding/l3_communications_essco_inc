Why ESSCO














Radome leader for over 50 years. Our acquisition by L3, a Fortune 250 company, provided ESSCO with the financial  stability to fund our continued growth and product development and access to  immense technical expertise and resources. This association has allowed  us to continue to build on our philosophy of providing the best performing  radomes in the world. Our commitment to excellence is what has separated  ESSCO from its competition for over half a century and will continue to be our  guiding principal as we move to the future.














What is a Radome














Radome antennas are precision instruments. Whether used for satellite communications,  air traffic control, weather tracking or surveillance, an antenna's  performance will suffer immeasurably if it's left to the mercy of the  elements. A radome is an  electromagnetically transparent dome-like structure that houses an antenna. The primary responsibilities of a radome are  to protect an antenna from the ravages of the environment, or to provide an  environment where the antenna is critical for security.









 





Why  ESSCO Radomes 














L3 ESSCO (ESSCO) has always been at the forefront of radome  technology. Throughout our history we  have been market leader in the radome industry and been first to market in the development of new membrane  materials, geometric designs, radome hydrophobic coatings and radome tuning  technology. As the industry leader in  radome technology, we are in a unique position to provide creative–cost  effective solutions to your requirements.

Radome Accessories
Accessories can be  added to any radome. Typical accessory offerings include::

Doors, hatches and windows 
Exterior accessories
Interior accessories
Installation accessories 
Maintenance accessories
Climate control equipment

DOORS, HATCHES AND WINDOWS
Base Access Hatches and Doors are used to gain access to the inside and outside of the radome.  Doors and/or base access hatches are located near the base of the radome for  direct entry into ground-mounted radomes or for access to catwalks on  tower-mounted radomes. Sizes range from approximately (26 in. x 26 in.) to (30 in. x 78 in.)
Large Equipment Doors or Access Openings
When large equipment needs to be moved on a regular basis, ESSCO can  design access doors to meet that requirement.   For sandwich radomes, we can also design quick removable  panels to lower the overall costs associated with large equipment doors.
Panel Removal Kits
For infrequent equipment access, it is possible to remove panels near  the base of the radome. Contact us to discuss your specific application as  these requirements differ significantly depending on the type of radome  utilized in your application.
Zenith Hatches and Vents are  often used on larger radomes to gain access to the upper exterior portion of  the radome. The zenith hatch can also be combined with a vent to provide a  simple ventilation system using natural convection to minimize stratification  of air inside the radome.  This is  accomplished by installing a manually adjustable louver at the base of the radome  resulting in a stack effect of airflow within the radome.  Where more ventilation is required a forced  ventilation system can be used.
A Boresight Window can be used to allow  alignment of the enclosed antenna without removal of a radome panel. An optically  transparent Lexan window (typically less than ½" thick) can be installed  in any designated radome panel.          
EXTERIOR ACCESSORIES 
Aircraft  Warning Light assemblies mark the radome in accordance with FAA requirements  or in-country requirements. The aircraft warning light includes a lightning rod  and can include a maintenance rope and pulley assembly. For international customers,  please review your local codes governing this equipment prior to placing an  order.
Lightning Protection  Systems, including a lightning arrestor, down conductors and grounding  wires, are generally used on sandwich radomes. Depending on site locations and  requirements, occasionally more robust systems are required to provide adequate  safety, as lightning is a random and unpredictable event. It should  be noted that total prevention or 100%  protection is impossible as the purpose of any lightning protection system is to mitigate the effects of lightning as  much as possible. In this regard, ESSCO has designed and provided multiple lighting rod systems in the U.S. and other areas meeting the requirements of  FAA-STD 019B and D.  For NATO and  countries throughout Europe, we have provided lightning protection systems  meeting IEC 62305-1. Metal  Space radomes act as a Faraday cage and do not require a separate lighting rod  unless equipped with an aircraft warning light, in which case it is provided  with the assembly and connected to the radome frame work at the top of the  radome to provide multiple uninterrupted conductive paths from the rod to the  base of the radome.          
INTERIOR ACCESSORIES 
Interior Lifting  Slings, Interior Lighting and Internal Zenith Ladders make it easy to work  on the enclosed antenna and help minimize antenna downtime.
INSTALLATION ACCESSORIES
Anchor Bolt Templates ensure accuracy of the interface between the radome and its foundation.  Unless installing a radome on an already  existing foundation, we strongly recommend ordering this accessory at the same  time as the radome in order to provide an accurate interface between the radome  and its foundation. Radome Lifting  Slings can lift an assembled radome on and off its foundation to reduce  antenna downtime; and Installation Tool Kits assist in radome  installation efforts.          
MAINTENANCE ACCESSORIES 
            ESSCO can  supply Anchor Points at the radome zenith to allow for safety line  attachment, Maintenance Rope and Pulley Assemblies, Climber's Harness Kits,  External Rope Ladders, Panel Repair Kits and Spare Panels, for ease of periodic maintenance for any  radome. ESSCO recommends  that a spare panel kit be purchased at the same time as the radome to avoid  costly setup charges and minimum material buys, if the spare panels are bought  at a later time. Contact ESSCO to discuss the right complement of panels to order for  your radome.
CLIMATE CONTROL EQUIPMENT 
            A  radome itself does not require any type of climate control, however in certain  cases where sensitive electronics could be affected by humidity or temperature,  or when trying to make the atmosphere more comfortable for personnel working  inside, environmental equipment, such as heaters, ventilation blowers,  dehumidifiers or air conditioners, may be necessary to control the  environment.
The table below provides an overview of  climate control systems that are typically used.  Please contact us to discuss your specific site conditions and equipment sizing.

In  this section you will find some of the tutorials and white papers that L3 ESSCO  has published over the years. After reading this material you will come to  understand why L3 ESSCO has been considered the world's leading authority on  radomes since 1961.  To this day, many of the papers L3 ESSCO has  published has set industry standards, and been adopted for determining radome  performance.
Tutorials          

IFR  Definition
              Every large radome has  joints in order to put the radome together.  These joints have EM wave  scattering properties that are very different from the scattering properties of  the panel surface and thus, the EM distortions introduced by the joints have to  be accounted for separate from those introduced by the panel.  To account  for these distortions the radome industry adopted what is referred to as the  IFR (Induced Field Ratio) approach to determine the overall scattering levels  of the radome and thus their performance.


The  Importance of Hydrophobic Coating
              It has been well  documented for years that water on the surface of a radome has a negative  effect with regards to antenna performance. This tutorial provides information  on the importance of using hydrophobic coatings to minimize transmission loss  in rain environments.


Noise Temperature of Metal Space Frame Radomes
              In a Metal Space Frame  Radome many engineers assume that the total transmission loss of the radome is  made up of the the losses due to the dielectric membranes plus the loss of the  metal space frame.  This is not the case and this tutorial provides  information on all of the components that make up the total transmission loss of  a metal space frame radome.


Using Metal in Radomes
              For many years it was assumed  that metal should not be used in front of an antenna aperture as it would block  RF energy.  Learn why the use of metal in some parts of a radome will  actually provide better overall performance.


Radome Selector Guide 
              The Radome Selector Guide provides an  overview of the four major types of ground based radomes.  The guide will  help you in choosing the best radome for your application.  In cases where  this is not clear, we recommend that you contact us and let one of  our sales professionals determine the best radome for your needs.
