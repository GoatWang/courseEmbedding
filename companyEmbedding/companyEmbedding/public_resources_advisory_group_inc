Letter From The President


Welcome,

Public Resources Advisory Group (“PRAG”) is a leading independent financial advisory firm serving state and local governments and their agencies and authorities, not-for-profits and other entities that secure funding in the public capital markets. PRAG is an independent investment advisor that is fully registered as a Municipal Advisor with the MSRB and SEC.
Since our founding in 1985, PRAG has experienced significant growth.  In our first year, we advised on 14 issues totaling just over $1.4 billion. This was only about 0.5% of the total market that year. In 2015 we advised on 155 issues totaling over $30.9 billion, almost 10% of the total market share. Based on this dollar volume, Thomson Reuters ranked PRAG third largest municipal advisory firm in the country in 2015.
In addition to our growth in market share, we are proud of our client retention. Several clients have retained PRAG as financial advisor since we were founded in 1985 while we have advised many others for more than twenty years. Our growth and our client retention result from three main features of our firm: independence, service and integrity.  They also reflect the development of a staff that is recognized for its quantitative capabilities, its understanding of markets and its knowledge of credit.
If you need assistance with financial planning, capital financing or investment advice, our professionals will provide optimal service.
 

Sincerely,

Steven Peyser
President
Public Resources Advisory Group

PRAG President Speaks at Bond Buyer Conference

February 19, 2015August 4, 2015PRAG 


February 19, 2015
Steven Peyser, President of PRAG, spoke at the The Bond Buyer’s National Outlook 2015 Conference held February 18 in New York City.  A highly debated topic on his panel, “Municipal Advisors Assuming a More Regulated Role,” was the Independent Registered Municipal Advisor, or IRMA, exemption, part of the SEC’s municipal advisor, or MA, registration rule, which went into effect last year.  The exemption allows an underwriter to avoid having to register as a MA as long as the issuer retains, as its own MA, an advisor that doesn’t have ties to an underwriting firm and says that it will rely on the MA’s advice.    Mr. Peyser discussed tweaking the exemption including the idea that the SEC grant another exemption for sophisticated issuers, which have historically used IRMAs, a suggestion that has garnered support from the industry.  Regulators recognized that the new MA rules may still have to be developed, as apparent by SEC Chief Counsel Rebecca Olsen’s statement there was “a lot of work left to do” on the rules in 2015. For more information on this panel and on The Bond Buyer’s National Outlook 2015 Conference please see the article “Municipal Advisors Concerned About IRMA Exemption” published in the February 18, 2015  The Bond Buyer.
