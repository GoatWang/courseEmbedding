Please be patient - there are more than 500 billion data points

"How many patients does this search cover?" -- This is a representative sampling of the
											iTrials Data Universe™, with ~36,000,000 patients or so. The main production database has
											many more.
"How long does a search take?" -- Most searches take only a few seconds. 
											The DirectConnect™ platform is indication-agnostic; it doesn't focus on specific illnesses or conditions.
											All data from all of our network sources (more than 200) is included, so if you search for a very common
											diagnosis (diabetes, cardiovasculer ailments, etc.), your search may take quite a while to complete!
											"I thought you would have more/less patients with [x] condition?" -- There can be a lot of
											reasons why the counts coming back from a search don't match the numbers you're expecting. These include:
											
Multiple ways to encode an indication in a patient history (ICD9, ICD10, various modifiers,
												references in unstructured data, etc.)
												Conditions with poor long term prognosis removing patients from the data set.
												Widely varying published incidence rates.
												Different naming conventions. For instance, Hunter Disease won't return any records - 
												you'll need to seearch for mucopolysaccharidosis.
											
"How can I get more information on the patient population I found?" -- Under the patient
											and provider counts, you'll see a Search ID - copy this number, and contact
											sales@itrials.com - you'll get a quick reply, and someone can
											tell you what metrics and analytics are available for your patient population.
											"What information is available on the patient population I found?" -- Everything. Patient
											locations, gender information, patient age, complete medical histories over several years including diagnoses,
											procedures, injections, labs, health plan metrics, out of pocket expenses, adjudications, modifiers, plan
											changes, provider and practice histories, referral events, and more. This longitudinal data set is what
											drives the DirectConnect analytics platform, and it can be generating business intelligence for your
											most challenging projects in a matter of minutes - call now:

Case Studies





When our CRO failed to develop productive sites, iTrials stepped in and with their evidence-based analysis, identified a pool of physicians who would become productive sites. iTrials then customized an outreach program and screened 20 sites within 60 days of our initial request."
-Bradley R. Newman, Global Product Director, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals

Scientific reasoning tells us that because of genetic differences, patients with similar tumors may respond differently to specific treatment regimens. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that we offer the optimal outcome to each and every patient.
-Richard Gaynor, M.D., Vice President, cancer research and global oncology platform leader at Lilly, on engaging iTrials to help identify and randomize ethnically relevant patients for the study.View Case Study





Our iTrials sites [yielded] more patients than our first 23 sites had enrolled over the previous 18 months. These types of results saved us over $1,000,000 in burn over a year period.
-Heather Neill, RN, CCRP, Associate Director of Clinical Affairs and Project ManagementView Case Study





With our NIH/Duke University study, we are able to see in real-time the impact our study protocol criteria have on patient identification allowing us to iteratively alter and therefore optimize our study design and presumably positively impact study outcome.
-Keith Sullivan, MD, Professor of Medicine and Head, Division of Medical Oncology and Transplantation, Duke UniversityView Case Study




Provisio was formed in 2003 in Nashville, Tennessee, to address the continuing problem of finding qualified patients and investigators for clinical trials. Since that time, we've worked with hundreds of clients, each with challenges ranging from finding enough patients to pull a trial out of rescue mode to providing detailed analytics for presentation to the FDA and NIH. Now, with DirectConnect, we bring our industry-leading toolset to your desktop! With a DirectConnect subscription, your team can log into the iTrials Data Universe and directly create pools of eligible patients in real time, and then generate the answers you need to make your study a success!
DirectConnect works in most browsers, as well as most smartphones and tablets. Reports can be scheduled for delivery by email, and additional report delivery options are available, such as PDF and Microsoft Word documents. For enterprise users, DirectConnect can be rebranded with your logo and layout choices, and reseller licensing is available. Subscriptions are configurable, with each subscription including 7 basic reports, and premium reports can be mixed, matched and added at any time. Or, work with Provisio's Professional Services Group, and have business intelligence generated and delivered directly to your team as soon as it's completed (example analysis targeting populations with Crohn's Disease: 3214S32_DD2_Crohns_Blinded.pdf).
