TreeHouse Health adds Reemo as the twelfth Portfolio Company to join the ecosystem.







Reemo is extremely excited to join the TreeHouse Health community. Being surrounded by other companies, leaders, and investors sets us up for continued success and growth in this space.


Minneapolis, MN (PRWEB)
May 02, 2016
 TreeHouse Health, an innovation center designed to invest in emerging healthcare companies and help accelerate their growth, announces the addition of a twelfth Portfolio Company, Reemo, a healthcare technology company that transforms existing wearable and home automation systems into an integrated user-centric monitoring platform for senior living providers and their members.
“We are happy to welcome Reemo into the TreeHouse Health ecosystem. They have a product and vision that has the potential to improve the life of their customers in a meaningful way while reducing cost from the system. We anticipate their continued growth during their time at TreeHouse Health,” says J.D. Blank, Managing Director at TreeHouse Health.   
Reemo’s software works with exisiting wearables and was designed to reimagine the senior living experience. This is done by enabling people to use their wearables to control their home electronics by using simple gestures, while giving caregivers the tools and information to prevent falls before they happen. Reemo feels their technology will help tackle the lack of independence that often results from mobility limitations, and improving the overall quality of life for users living with a monitoring solution.
The Reemo team has been busy securing new customers and partnerships, one large partner being Samsung. Reemo’s technology integrates with Samsung’s Gear S2 Smart Watch and SmartThings technologies to control daily household activities, such as adjusting a thermostat, turning on/off lights, or locking the doors.  
“Reemo is extremely excited to join the TreeHouse Health community. Over the past year, we have continued to grow beyond a great team with awesome technology into a company dedicated solely to our healthcare mission. Being surrounded by other companies, leaders, and investors sets us up for continued success and growth in this space,” says Al Baker, CEO of Reemo.
During the time Portfolio Companies spend at TreeHouse Health, they are exposed to leading established healthcare organizations, investors, clinical collaborators, payers, and other expert resources. The TreeHouse Health ecosystem offers this exposure as well as cash investment, office space, and a strong focus on business development. The Reemo team will have a presence in the TreeHouse Health space and access to the whole ecosystem.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Don Fox of Firehouse of Subs Joins Treehouse Health Board of Managers
Emerging Eye Health Brand to Leverage Franchise Expertise
Bethesda, MD—Treehouse Health, LLC, the country’s first eye care company focused exclusively on treating myopia in children, has appointed Don Fox to its Board of Managers in preparation for expansion. Don is Chief Executive Officer of Firehouse of America, LLC, where he leads the strategic growth of Firehouse Subs, one of America’s leading fast casual restaurant brands. He also serves as its chief spokesperson, sits on various boards of influence in the restaurant community, and is a respected speaker, commentator and published author. Under Don’s leadership, Firehouse Subs has grown from 65 restaurants to more than 1,050 restaurants in 44 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico, and is consistently recognized as one of the best franchises in the country.
“We are thrilled to have attracted a highly-respected executive with extensive multi-unit retail experience to the Treehouse Health Board,” said Matt Oerding, CEO and Co-founder of Treehouse Health. “Don’s wealth of experience will be incredibly valuable to our team as we start to expand our model into other markets.”
“I’m excited to be a part of something really important, giving children better vision for life,” says Fox. “The work done at Treehouse Eyes can change the way myopia is treated, and provide a critically needed service for parents worried about their children’s vision and eye health.” Dr. Gary Gerber, Co-founder and Chief Myopia Reduction Officer of Treehouse Health, added, “This is an exciting time as we take our Treehouse Eyes model into other markets. Over 10 million U.S. children are myopic today, and this number is growing rapidly as children spend less time outdoors and more time reading and on devices. We’ve already got world class scientific and clinical advisors, and Don’s addition to our board is a perfect complement to that team. We want to expand rapidly to address this large and underserved market, and adding Don to our Board helps us to strategically consider the best way to expand our model.”
About Treehouse HealthTreehouse Health was formed to provide an innovative eye care service model to address the growing issue of childhood myopia. Initial reaction to the first Treehouse Eyes centers in metro Washington D.C. has been extremely positive, as the company has educated parents about the opportunity to treat their children’s myopia vs. just getting stronger glasses every year. The company plans to expand later in 2017 and add more centers throughout the U.S. to address this critically important problem.
