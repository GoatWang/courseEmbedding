                           Project Management in Product Development: Leadership Skills and Management Techniques to Deliver Great Products is written
                              for new and aspiring project managers in product development. Although texts on project management are common, the material
                              presented here is unique, instead focusing on product development, a challenging segment of project management because of
                              the high level of uncertainty, the need for a robust set of problem-solving techniques, and a demand for broad cross-functional
                              teams. The book also focuses on more than just project management techniques, including a thorough treatment of transformational
                              and transactional leadership. Other topics covered include problem-solving techniques, development, and continuous improvement
                              of processes required in product development, risk recognition and management, and proper communication with mangers and other
                              stakeholders. Finally, project management techniques used in product development are presented, including the critical path
                              method, scrum and XP, and Kanban/lean project development, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each. *Provides ways
                              to successfully manage product development projects by teaching traditional and advanced project management techniques like
                              Gantt, CPM, Agile, Lean, and others *Covers transformational and transactional leadership, how to create a vision and engage
                              the team, as well as tactics on how to manage a complex set of tasks *Uses a practical, common sense approach to the day-to-day
                              activities of a project manager, including project planning, project process development, problem-solving, project portfolio
                              management, reporting, and more *Presents a thorough comparison of popular project management tools *Includes many examples,
                              cases, and side-bars that are included throughout the book -- Taken from Amazon.com

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Early life[edit]
Johnson was born in Richton, Mississippi, in a three-room sharecropper's shack.[1] When he was two, he moved to Chicago with his mother, Priscilla, after his parents had separated. At the age of eight, while attending Doolittle Elementary School, Johnson also started work as a shoe shine boy. He later attended Wendell Phillips High School but dropped out to work full-time jobs.[2] During the day he was a bus boy and in the evenings he set pins at a local bowling alley.[3] In 1944, he took a job working for Samuel B. Fuller, who owned a cosmetics firm, as a production chemist.
Entrepreneurship[edit]
In 1954, at the encouragement of co-worker, Johnson left the Fuller company and founded Johnson Products with his wife Joan,[4] focusing on the African American male hair care market. Johnson borrowed $250 from a bank and another $250 from a friend to finance the venture.[1] The company’s first product was Ultra Wave, a hair relaxer for men. In 1957, Ultra Sheen, a revolutionary hair straightener that could easily be used in the home, was introduced for women.
During the next quarter century, more product lines were introduced like Afro Sheen.[1] Afro-Sheen, one of Johnson's best-known products, was released in the late 1960s, at a time when the "Afro" became a popular hairstyle for African Americans.
Over the next few decades, Johnson Products continued to grow, focusing its efforts on not only its products line but on training cosmetologists on the proper usage as well. In 1964, Johnson founded Independence Bank, and during the 1970s he became the exclusive sponsor behind the nationally syndicated dance show Soul Train.
In 1971, Johnson Products became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[1]That same year, Johnson became the first African American to serve on the board of directors of Commonwealth Edison.
Awards and honors[edit]
George E. Johnson, Sr. received the Horatio Alger Award in 1981[5] and the Babson Medal in 1983[6]
He received an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science degree from College of the Holy Cross in 1975 and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Babson College in 1976[7]
In popular culture[edit]
A short documentary on George E. Johnson, Sr. and the Johnson Products Company was produced by The Czar of Black Hollywood director Bayer Mack and released by Block Starz Music Television as part of its Profiles of African-American Success video series. [8][9]

During the next quarter century, more product lines were introduced like Afro Sheen.[1] Afro-Sheen, one of Johnson's best-known products, was released in the late 1960s, at a time when the "Afro" became a popular hairstyle for African Americans.
Over the next few decades, Johnson Products continued to grow, focusing its efforts on not only its products line but on training cosmetologists on the proper usage as well. In 1964, Johnson founded Independence Bank, and during the 1970s he became the exclusive sponsor behind the nationally syndicated dance show Soul Train.
In 1971, Johnson Products became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[1]That same year, Johnson became the first African American to serve on the board of directors of Commonwealth Edison.

George E. Johnson, Sr. received the Horatio Alger Award in 1981[5] and the Babson Medal in 1983[6]
He received an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science degree from College of the Holy Cross in 1975 and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Babson College in 1976[7]
In popular culture[edit]

Early life[edit]
Johnson was born in Richton, Mississippi, in a three-room sharecropper's shack.[1] When he was two, he moved to Chicago with his mother, Priscilla, after his parents had separated. At the age of eight, while attending Doolittle Elementary School, Johnson also started work as a shoe shine boy. He later attended Wendell Phillips High School but dropped out to work full-time jobs.[2] During the day he was a bus boy and in the evenings he set pins at a local bowling alley.[3] In 1944, he took a job working for Samuel B. Fuller, who owned a cosmetics firm, as a production chemist.
Entrepreneurship[edit]
In 1954, at the encouragement of co-worker, Johnson left the Fuller company and founded Johnson Products with his wife Joan,[4] focusing on the African American male hair care market. Johnson borrowed $250 from a bank and another $250 from a friend to finance the venture.[1] The company’s first product was Ultra Wave, a hair relaxer for men. In 1957, Ultra Sheen, a revolutionary hair straightener that could easily be used in the home, was introduced for women.
During the next quarter century, more product lines were introduced like Afro Sheen.[1] Afro-Sheen, one of Johnson's best-known products, was released in the late 1960s, at a time when the "Afro" became a popular hairstyle for African Americans.

In 1971, Johnson Products became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[1]That same year, Johnson became the first African American to serve on the board of directors of Commonwealth Edison.
Awards and honors[edit]
