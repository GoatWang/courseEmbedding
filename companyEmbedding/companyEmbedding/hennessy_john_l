Early life[edit]
Hennessy was raised in Huntington, New York, as one of six children.[6] His father was an aerospace engineer and his mother was a teacher before raising her children.[6]
He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University, and his master's degree and Ph.D. in computer science from Stony Brook University.[7] He is married to his high school sweetheart, Andrea Berti.[6]
Career[edit]
Hennessy became a Stanford faculty member in 1977. In 1981, he began the MIPS project to investigate RISC processors, and in 1984, he used his sabbatical year to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to commercialize the technology developed by his research. In 1987, he became the Willard and Inez Kerr Bell Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[7]
Hennessy served as director of Stanford's Computer System Laboratory (1989–93), a research center run by Stanford's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments. He was chair of the Department of Computer Science (1994–96) and Dean of the School of Engineering (1996–99).[7]
In 1999, Stanford President Gerhard Casper appointed Hennessy to succeed Condoleezza Rice as Provost of Stanford University. When Casper stepped down to focus on teaching in 2000, the Stanford Board of Trustees named Hennessy to succeed Casper as president. In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.[8]
In 1997, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).[9]
Hennessy is a board member of Google,[10] Cisco Systems,[11] Atheros Communications,[12] the Daniel Pearl Foundation.[13] and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.[14]
In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for fundamental contributions to engineering education, advances in computer architecture, and the integration of leading-edge research with education".[15]
On October 14, 2010, Hennessy was presented a khata by the 14th Dalai Lama before His Holiness addressed Maples Pavilion.[16]
In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust urging the passage of the DREAM Act;[17] the legislation did not pass the 111th United States Congress.
In 2012, Hennessy was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor.[18] The IEEE awarded Hennessy their highest recognition "for pioneering the RISC processor architecture and for leadership in computer engineering and higher education".[19] In 2012, Hennessy received an honorary doctor of mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo (Canada), in celebration of his profound contributions to modern computer architecture and to post-secondary education.
In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.
In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.[20]
In fall 2016, Hennessy will serve as the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program's inaugural director; this is a $750 million endowment to fully fund graduate students for three years.[21]
Research[edit]
Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with David A. Patterson, two well-known books on computer architecture, Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface and Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach,[2] which introduced the DLX RISC architecture. They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.[citation needed]
Hennessy also contributed to updating Donald Knuth's MIX processor to the MMIX. Both are model computers used in Knuth's classic series, The Art of Computer Programming. MMIX is Knuth's DLX equivalent.
In 2004, he was awarded the Association for Computing Machinery SIGARCH ISCA Influential Paper Award for his 1989 co-authored paper on high performing cache hierarchies.[22] He received the award again in 2009 for his 1994 co-authored paper on the Stanford FLASH multiprocessor.[23]

Early life[edit]
Hennessy was raised in Huntington, New York, as one of six children.[6] His father was an aerospace engineer and his mother was a teacher before raising her children.[6]
He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University, and his master's degree and Ph.D. in computer science from Stony Brook University.[7] He is married to his high school sweetheart, Andrea Berti.[6]
Career[edit]
Hennessy became a Stanford faculty member in 1977. In 1981, he began the MIPS project to investigate RISC processors, and in 1984, he used his sabbatical year to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to commercialize the technology developed by his research. In 1987, he became the Willard and Inez Kerr Bell Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[7]
Hennessy served as director of Stanford's Computer System Laboratory (1989–93), a research center run by Stanford's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments. He was chair of the Department of Computer Science (1994–96) and Dean of the School of Engineering (1996–99).[7]
In 1999, Stanford President Gerhard Casper appointed Hennessy to succeed Condoleezza Rice as Provost of Stanford University. When Casper stepped down to focus on teaching in 2000, the Stanford Board of Trustees named Hennessy to succeed Casper as president. In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.[8]
In 1997, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).[9]
Hennessy is a board member of Google,[10] Cisco Systems,[11] Atheros Communications,[12] the Daniel Pearl Foundation.[13] and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.[14]
In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for fundamental contributions to engineering education, advances in computer architecture, and the integration of leading-edge research with education".[15]
On October 14, 2010, Hennessy was presented a khata by the 14th Dalai Lama before His Holiness addressed Maples Pavilion.[16]
In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust urging the passage of the DREAM Act;[17] the legislation did not pass the 111th United States Congress.
In 2012, Hennessy was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor.[18] The IEEE awarded Hennessy their highest recognition "for pioneering the RISC processor architecture and for leadership in computer engineering and higher education".[19] In 2012, Hennessy received an honorary doctor of mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo (Canada), in celebration of his profound contributions to modern computer architecture and to post-secondary education.
In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.
In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.[20]
In fall 2016, Hennessy will serve as the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program's inaugural director; this is a $750 million endowment to fully fund graduate students for three years.[21]
Research[edit]
Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with David A. Patterson, two well-known books on computer architecture, Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface and Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach,[2] which introduced the DLX RISC architecture. They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.[citation needed]
Hennessy also contributed to updating Donald Knuth's MIX processor to the MMIX. Both are model computers used in Knuth's classic series, The Art of Computer Programming. MMIX is Knuth's DLX equivalent.
In 2004, he was awarded the Association for Computing Machinery SIGARCH ISCA Influential Paper Award for his 1989 co-authored paper on high performing cache hierarchies.[22] He received the award again in 2009 for his 1994 co-authored paper on the Stanford FLASH multiprocessor.[23]

                           As the authors explain in their preface to the Second Edition, computer architecture itself has undergone significant change
                              since 1990. Concentrating on currently predominant and emerging commercial systems, Hennessy and Patterson have prepared entirely
                              new chapters covering additional advanced topics. A new chapter emphasizes superscalar and multiple issues. * Networks : a
                              chapter examines in depth the design issues for small and large shared-memory multiprocessors. This book includes coverage
                              of I/O performance measures; memory : caches and memory-hierarchy design addresses contemporary design issues. It is completely
                              revised on current architectures such as MIPS R4000, Intel 80x86 and Pentium, PowerPC, and HP PA-RISC

                              to provide a new focus on the revolutionary change taking place in industry today: the switch from uniprocessor to multicore

                           worldwide
                           The performance of software systems is dramatically affected by how well software designers understand the basic hardware
                              technologies at work in a system. Similarly, hardware designers must understand the far-reaching effects their design decisions
                              have on software applications. For readers in either category, this classic introduction to the field provides a look deep

                           "Hennessy's original research area was optimizing compilers. His research group at Stanford developed many of the techniques
                              now in commercial use. In 1981, Hennessy started the MIPS project at Stanford with a handful of graduate students. After completing
                              the project in 1984, he took a one-year sabbatical to co-found MIPS Computer Systems, which has since merged with Silicon
                              Graphics. The RISC architecture developed at MIPS has been utilized by a number of companies including DEC, NEC, Siemens,
                              Silicon Graphics, and Tandem. Hennessy's current research at Stanford focuses on the area of designing and exploiting multiprocessors.
                              Most recently, he has been involved in the development of the DASH multiprocessor architecture."--Jacket

                           Information technology (IT) is essential to virtually all of the nation s critical infrastructures making them vulnerable
                              by a terrorist attack on their IT system. An attack could be on the system itself or use the IT system to launch or exacerbate
                              another type of attack. IT can also be used as a counterterrorism tool. The report concludes that the most devastating consequences
                              of a terrorist attack would occur if it were on or used IT as part of a broader attack. The report presents two recommendations
                              on what can be done in the short term to protect the nation s communications and information systems and several recommendations
                              about what can be done over the longer term. The report also notes the importance of considering how an IT system will be
                              deployed to maximize protection against and usefulness in responding to attacks

Description


Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, Fifth Edition, explores the ways that software and technology in the cloud are accessed by digital media, such as cell phones, computers, tablets, and other mobile devices. The book, which became a part of Intel's 2012 recommended reading list for developers, covers the revolution of mobile computing. It also highlights the two most important factors in architecture today: parallelism and memory hierarchy.
This fully updated edition is comprised of six chapters that follow a consistent framework: explanation of the ideas in each chapter; a crosscutting issues section, which presents how the concepts covered in one chapter connect with those given in other chapters; a putting it all together section that links these concepts by discussing how they are applied in real machine; and detailed examples of misunderstandings and architectural traps commonly encountered by developers and architects. Formulas for energy, static and dynamic power, integrated circuit costs, reliability, and availability are included. The book also covers virtual machines, SRAM and DRAM technologies, and new material on Flash memory. Other topics include the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism in high-performance processors, superscalar execution, dynamic scheduling and multithreading, vector architectures, multicore processors, and warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). There are updated case studies and completely new exercises. Additional reference appendices are available online.
This book will be a valuable reference for computer architects, programmers, application developers, compiler and system software developers, computer system designers and application developers.

Reviews


"What has made this book an enduring classic is that each edition is not an update, but an extensive revision that presents the most current information and unparalleled insight into this fascinating and fast changing field. For me, after over twenty years in this profession, it is also another opportunity to experience that student-grade admiration for two remarkable teachers." — From the Foreword by Luiz André Barroso, Google, Inc.
"This is an academic textbook that is also suitable for a far broader readership. Each chapter is organised in the same structure, with the main content supported by case studies and exercises… Having read this book I now have a far better understanding of why processors from all the different designers and manufacturers are so different. Memory hierarchies, multicore architectures and compiler optimisation are all covered in great detail. I was particularly interested in their discussion of graphical processing units and how they are suitable for far more than just graphical workloads… What is great about this book is that it moves with the times. There is a lot of content on processors for mobile computing, and power usage is a pervasive theme. At the other extreme there is an excellent chapter on warehouse scale computers, which offers tremendous insight into the cloud computing infrastructure provided by Google, Amazon and others. If your job has anything to do with IT infrastructure then I recommend this book as a must-read. As an academic text book it has both depth and breadth. And if you're just interested in the topic you'll gain a huge amount of insight into the fundamentals of computer architecture."--The Chartered Institute for IT

                           The performance of software systems is dramatically affected by how well software designers understand the basic hardware
                              technologies at work in a system. Similarly, hardware designers must understand the far-reaching effects their design decisions
                              have on software applications. For readers in either category, this classic introduction to the field provides a look deep
                              into the computer. It demonstrates the relationships between the software and hardware and focuses on the foundational concepts
                              that are the basis for current computer design

                           "Hennessy's original research area was optimizing compilers. His research group at Stanford developed many of the techniques
                              now in commercial use. In 1981, Hennessy started the MIPS project at Stanford with a handful of graduate students. After completing
                              the project in 1984, he took a one-year sabbatical to co-found MIPS Computer Systems, which has since merged with Silicon
                              Graphics. The RISC architecture developed at MIPS has been utilized by a number of companies including DEC, NEC, Siemens,
                              Silicon Graphics, and Tandem. Hennessy's current research at Stanford focuses on the area of designing and exploiting multiprocessors.
                              Most recently, he has been involved in the development of the DASH multiprocessor architecture."--Jacket

                           Information technology (IT) is essential to virtually all of the nation s critical infrastructures making them vulnerable
                              by a terrorist attack on their IT system. An attack could be on the system itself or use the IT system to launch or exacerbate
                              another type of attack. IT can also be used as a counterterrorism tool. The report concludes that the most devastating consequences
                              of a terrorist attack would occur if it were on or used IT as part of a broader attack. The report presents two recommendations
                              on what can be done in the short term to protect the nation s communications and information systems and several recommendations
                              about what can be done over the longer term. The report also notes the importance of considering how an IT system will be
                              deployed to maximize protection against and usefulness in responding to attacks

Early life[edit]
Hennessy was raised in Huntington, New York, as one of six children.[6] His father was an aerospace engineer and his mother was a teacher before raising her children.[6]
He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University, and his master's degree and Ph.D. in computer science from Stony Brook University.[7] He is married to his high school sweetheart, Andrea Berti.[6]
Career[edit]
Hennessy became a Stanford faculty member in 1977. In 1981, he began the MIPS project to investigate RISC processors, and in 1984, he used his sabbatical year to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to commercialize the technology developed by his research. In 1987, he became the Willard and Inez Kerr Bell Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[7]
Hennessy served as director of Stanford's Computer System Laboratory (1989–93), a research center run by Stanford's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments. He was chair of the Department of Computer Science (1994–96) and Dean of the School of Engineering (1996–99).[7]
In 1999, Stanford President Gerhard Casper appointed Hennessy to succeed Condoleezza Rice as Provost of Stanford University. When Casper stepped down to focus on teaching in 2000, the Stanford Board of Trustees named Hennessy to succeed Casper as president. In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.[8]
In 1997, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).[9]
Hennessy is a board member of Google,[10] Cisco Systems,[11] Atheros Communications,[12] the Daniel Pearl Foundation.[13] and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.[14]
In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for fundamental contributions to engineering education, advances in computer architecture, and the integration of leading-edge research with education".[15]
On October 14, 2010, Hennessy was presented a khata by the 14th Dalai Lama before His Holiness addressed Maples Pavilion.[16]
In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust urging the passage of the DREAM Act;[17] the legislation did not pass the 111th United States Congress.
In 2012, Hennessy was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor.[18] The IEEE awarded Hennessy their highest recognition "for pioneering the RISC processor architecture and for leadership in computer engineering and higher education".[19] In 2012, Hennessy received an honorary doctor of mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo (Canada), in celebration of his profound contributions to modern computer architecture and to post-secondary education.
In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.
In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.[20]
In fall 2016, Hennessy will serve as the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program's inaugural director; this is a $750 million endowment to fully fund graduate students for three years.[21]
Research[edit]
Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with David A. Patterson, two well-known books on computer architecture, Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface and Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach,[2] which introduced the DLX RISC architecture. They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.[citation needed]
Hennessy also contributed to updating Donald Knuth's MIX processor to the MMIX. Both are model computers used in Knuth's classic series, The Art of Computer Programming. MMIX is Knuth's DLX equivalent.
In 2004, he was awarded the Association for Computing Machinery SIGARCH ISCA Influential Paper Award for his 1989 co-authored paper on high performing cache hierarchies.[22] He received the award again in 2009 for his 1994 co-authored paper on the Stanford FLASH multiprocessor.[23]

John Leroy Hennessy (born September 22, 1952) is an American computer scientist, academician, and businessman. Hennessy is one of the founders of MIPS Computer Systems Inc. as well as Atheros and served as the tenth President of Stanford University. Hennessy announced that he would step down in the summer of 2016. He was succeeded as President by Marc Tessier-Lavigne.[5] Marc Andreessen called him "the godfather of Silicon Valley."[6]

Early life[edit]
Hennessy was raised in Huntington, New York, as one of six children.[6] His father was an aerospace engineer and his mother was a teacher before raising her children.[6]
He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University, and his master's degree and Ph.D. in computer science from Stony Brook University.[7] He is married to his high school sweetheart, Andrea Berti.[6]
Career[edit]
Hennessy became a Stanford faculty member in 1977. In 1981, he began the MIPS project to investigate RISC processors, and in 1984, he used his sabbatical year to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to commercialize the technology developed by his research. In 1987, he became the Willard and Inez Kerr Bell Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.[7]
Hennessy served as director of Stanford's Computer System Laboratory (1989–93), a research center run by Stanford's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments. He was chair of the Department of Computer Science (1994–96) and Dean of the School of Engineering (1996–99).[7]
In 1999, Stanford President Gerhard Casper appointed Hennessy to succeed Condoleezza Rice as Provost of Stanford University. When Casper stepped down to focus on teaching in 2000, the Stanford Board of Trustees named Hennessy to succeed Casper as president. In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.[8]
In 1997, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).[9]
Hennessy is a board member of Google,[10] Cisco Systems,[11] Atheros Communications,[12] the Daniel Pearl Foundation.[13] and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.[14]
In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for fundamental contributions to engineering education, advances in computer architecture, and the integration of leading-edge research with education".[15]
On October 14, 2010, Hennessy was presented a khata by the 14th Dalai Lama before His Holiness addressed Maples Pavilion.[16]
In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust urging the passage of the DREAM Act;[17] the legislation did not pass the 111th United States Congress.
In 2012, Hennessy was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor.[18] The IEEE awarded Hennessy their highest recognition "for pioneering the RISC processor architecture and for leadership in computer engineering and higher education".[19] In 2012, Hennessy received an honorary doctor of mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo (Canada), in celebration of his profound contributions to modern computer architecture and to post-secondary education.
In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.
In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.[20]
In fall 2016, Hennessy will serve as the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program's inaugural director; this is a $750 million endowment to fully fund graduate students for three years.[21]
Research[edit]
Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with David A. Patterson, two well-known books on computer architecture, Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface and Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach,[2] which introduced the DLX RISC architecture. They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.[citation needed]
Hennessy also contributed to updating Donald Knuth's MIX processor to the MMIX. Both are model computers used in Knuth's classic series, The Art of Computer Programming. MMIX is Knuth's DLX equivalent.
In 2004, he was awarded the Association for Computing Machinery SIGARCH ISCA Influential Paper Award for his 1989 co-authored paper on high performing cache hierarchies.[22] He received the award again in 2009 for his 1994 co-authored paper on the Stanford FLASH multiprocessor.[23]

In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.[8]
In 1997, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).[9]
Hennessy is a board member of Google,[10] Cisco Systems,[11] Atheros Communications,[12] the Daniel Pearl Foundation.[13] and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.[14]
In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for fundamental contributions to engineering education, advances in computer architecture, and the integration of leading-edge research with education".[15]
On October 14, 2010, Hennessy was presented a khata by the 14th Dalai Lama before His Holiness addressed Maples Pavilion.[16]
In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust urging the passage of the DREAM Act;[17] the legislation did not pass the 111th United States Congress.
In 2012, Hennessy was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor.[18] The IEEE awarded Hennessy their highest recognition "for pioneering the RISC processor architecture and for leadership in computer engineering and higher education".[19] In 2012, Hennessy received an honorary doctor of mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo (Canada), in celebration of his profound contributions to modern computer architecture and to post-secondary education.
In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.
In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.[20]
In fall 2016, Hennessy will serve as the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program's inaugural director; this is a $750 million endowment to fully fund graduate students for three years.[21]
Research[edit]
Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with David A. Patterson, two well-known books on computer architecture, Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface and Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach,[2] which introduced the DLX RISC architecture. They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.[citation needed]
Hennessy also contributed to updating Donald Knuth's MIX processor to the MMIX. Both are model computers used in Knuth's classic series, The Art of Computer Programming. MMIX is Knuth's DLX equivalent.
In 2004, he was awarded the Association for Computing Machinery SIGARCH ISCA Influential Paper Award for his 1989 co-authored paper on high performing cache hierarchies.[22] He received the award again in 2009 for his 1994 co-authored paper on the Stanford FLASH multiprocessor.[23]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
