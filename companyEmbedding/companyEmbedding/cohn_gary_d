Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.[46]
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.[47]

Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.[46]
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.[47]

Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.[46]
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.[47]

Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.[46]
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.[47]

Goldman Sachs has rewarded its departing president, Gary D. Cohn, with expedited access to cash and stock payments valued at nearly $300 million, and in doing so has tacitly encouraged another of its executives to accept an influential role in Washington.Late on Tuesday, Mr. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council advising President Trump, disclosed in a securities filing that he and his family members had received ownership that day of 940,908 shares of Goldman stock — a position valued at nearly $220 million. That award came in addition to a cash payout, announced the same day, amounting to about $65 million, leaving him with a total windfall of about $285 million.Given that Mr. Cohn, 56, is required to divest his Goldman shares under federal ethics laws, “we took these actions to enable him to comply with the conflict of interest rules, just as we have done for people in the de Blasio administration,” said Jake Siewert, a company spokesman, referring to the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. Under a standing policy, Mr. Siewert added, Goldman allows departing employees who are entering government service to keep their stock.In recent weeks, someone familiar with Mr. Cohn’s financial plans said, he made substantial donations to various charities in preparation for his new job, and he is poised to sell at least some of his Goldman shares. He is drawing no salary for his work at the White House, the person added.

A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Goldman’s acceleration of its usual curbs on the eligibility of Mr. Cohn’s stock for sale has revived a debate over whether veterans of the firm who enter public service receive special treatment from the firm — or whether the firm receives such treatment from former employees in government.

Some experts on government ethics said Goldman’s treatment of Mr. Cohn smacked of favoritism. “They’re playing a game, and they’re playing a game to make this person feel beholden to Goldman Sachs,” said Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Painter was among lawyers who recently sued Mr. Trump, accusing him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump called the suit meritless.“If Goldman Sachs has a contractual right to keep the stock, but they on a case-by-case basis almost always let you keep the stock if you go into government service, then that’s what’s called an extraordinary payment,” Mr. Painter added.If Mr. Cohn’s exit pay is ultimately defined as an extraordinary payment — typically a payment of more than $10,000 that is in addition to the employer’s existing obligation and at a time when government employment appears possible — he could be barred from participating in matters related to Goldman for two years.

Mr. Cohn, who joined Goldman in 1990 and eventually became its No. 2 executive, was paid well for his 26 years of service, which included traveling the world on client and regulatory matters, serving on the company’s board and handling many of the firm’s day-to-day management issues.A significant portion of the nearly one million Goldman shares that he and his family now own were already eligible for sale. But a substantial amount of stock, mostly in the form of restricted shares, would normally not have been available to be sold for up to three years, according to Tuesday’s regulatory filings.In addition, Goldman bought back Mr. Cohn’s stakes in certain private equity funds and hedge funds managed by the firm, according to one filing. Some of the purchases were made at discounted prices because of the difficulty of selling out of the positions.Goldman’s actions toward Mr. Cohn are part of “a longstanding tradition of encouraging people to give back to their communities when they leave the firm,” Mr. Siewert said, “and that’s an important part of the culture here.”Indeed, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and other financial firms have policies similar to Goldman’s. But some shareholders find the practice objectionable.Last year, an arm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. filed shareholder proposals at Goldman and four other major publicly traded banks (a sixth proposal was later withdrawn) seeking to end the practice of hastening stock sales by employees departing for government service. The proposals, which have been defeated in previous years, reflect the union group’s concerns that relaxing the vesting policies would encourage important employees to leave their jobs.

“The point of equity compensation is to attract and retain executives,” said Brandon Rees, deputy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s investment office. “Ultimately, I think it’s in the best interest of companies that their compensation practices be seen as not compromising the objectivity of government officials.”

Gary Cohn Is the Wrong Choice to Head the Fed








John Tamny


Monday, July 24, 2017
















































While the very healthy growth of finance beyond the traditional banking and investment banking sectors has changed perceptions somewhat, being named a partner at Goldman Sachs remains one of the most prestigious accomplishments on all of Wall Street. It’s well known that a partnership at the world’s most prominent investment bank carries with it cachet that few career designations can match.
Yet what’s less well known is how extraordinarily difficult it is to maintain one’s partner status at Goldman after having been invited into this most meritocratic of Clubs. As a former very senior Goldman investment banker once told me (full disclosure: I worked at Goldman Sachs from 1998 to 2001), and I only slightly paraphrase, “once you’re named partner the clock starts ticking. Unless you achieve something really remarkable very quickly, you’ll be kicked out.”
So while Cohn’s accomplishments recommend him for all sorts of prominent jobs he remains the wrong choice for Fed Chair.
In short, the hardest work for Goldman partners arguably takes place after they’ve reached the proverbial mountaintop.
This is something for the Federal Reserve-focused to keep in mind when thinking about former Goldman #2 Gary Cohn’s desire to replace Janet Yellen as Fed Chairman. Cohn not only made partner at Goldman, he plainly thrived. And he thrived for a very long time.
Whatever one’s view of the Fed, Goldman Sachs, or government in general, what can’t be denied is that Cohn is a remarkably talented person. Sorry, but you just don’t last that long at GS, and at such a high level, unless you’re accomplishing things that very few can.
So while Cohn’s accomplishments alone recommend him for all sorts of prominent jobs in a place where prominence often dies (see Cohn’s former GS colleague, Henry Paulson’s Washington, D.C. stint), he remains the wrong choice for Fed Chair. Importantly, the view that Cohn is the wrong choice has nothing to do with him expanding the central bank’s long overstated power.
The Fed’s Overstated Power
About it, the Fed’s greatest champions think that it can quite literally plan economic growth, that it can dictate specific outcomes of the “money supply” and GDP variety, and that its keen sense of the ridiculous notion of “full employment” allows it to control inflation. What a laugh.
As the 20th century revealed in bright and tragically bloody colors, central planning of any economic outcome is a horrific impossibility. Somehow Fed cheerleaders and their reliably clueless enablers in the media have spared the central bank from the 20th century’s clear verdict about the 100% failure rate of control from the Commanding Heights. That the U.S. economy still booms is a reminder that the Fed has the power to plan next to nothing. Thank goodness.
Economic growth is the greatest enemy rising prices have ever known.
Furthermore, the accepted non-wisdom inside the Fed that says economic growth causes inflation through product and labor shortages ignores the basic laws of economics. To consume is to logically produce first, so the notion that surging production authors shortages ignores how we’re able to consume in the first place. These things balance.
And then as history and logic make abundantly clear, economic growth is the greatest enemy rising prices have ever known. That technological advances are by their very name investment advances that lead to more production in return for less human labor input (thus, lower prices), that production in the U.S. is a global endeavor (think the globalized nature of the production of Boeing and Ford automobiles, to name two), is plainly lost on the Fed’s narrow minds.
Growth itself is what mitigates what is always and everywhere a mirage (labor shortages), except inside the minds of Fed officials. Not only can it not plan or dictate economic outcomes, its discredited models of how the world works indicate that it wouldn’t know what to do even if it could.
As for the Fed’s greatest critics, they needlessly flatter it. Never explained by those convinced that the Fed is the source of nearly every economic ill in the world is how an entity which projects its influence through an antiquated U.S. banking sector, one that represents a small fraction of total domestic credit, could have so much control over the most dynamic economy in the world; one that largely operates free of the risk-averse credit offered up by banks.
Dollar Devaluations
Regarding the popular view among conspiracy theorists that the dollar’s 93% decline has been a creation of the Fed's machinations, history mocks this claim. Lest we forget, major dollar devaluations revealed their ugly head in the 19th century despite the Fed being created in the 20th.
Cohn indicated that a weak currency has a positive impact on the economy. Ok, but it doesn’t.
As for the 20th, it was FDR, not the Fed, who foisted a devalued dollar on an already limping U.S. economy in 1933. It was Richard Nixon and his Treasury department, not the Fed, who chose to de-link the dollar from gold in 1971, thus setting in motion a decade of economic malaise that is always the result of devaluation.
Notable here is that Fed Chairman Eugene Meyer resigned over FDR’s mistake, while Arthur Burns begged Nixon to not commit his. There’s nothing to the Fed’s long association with the dollar’s exchange rate despite the overdone claims of the Fed’s greatest critics. They plainly don’t know why they should despise it.
Still, the dollar paradoxically looms as a reason for President Trump to not appoint Cohn. It does because of the perceptions it will create about the Administration’s stance on the matter.
While the dollar’s exchange rate is plainly not part of the Fed’s portfolio (that’s why Fed officials almost as a rule don’t comment on it), it’s been reported by prominent sources that when he initially met with President-elect Trump ahead of the transition, Cohn indicated that a weak currency has a positive impact on the economy. Ok, but it doesn’t.
The economy is not a blob, it’s just people. People earn dollars, and their economic chances are not enhanced when what they earn is being robbed of its value.
If Trump embraces the discredited FDR, Nixon, Carter, Bush (43) policies in favor of a weak currency, his economic program will fail.
Furthermore, the Trump administration has singled out jobs and opportunity as its major economic focus. This speaks loudly to how crippling a policy in favor of a weak dollar would be. There are quite simply no companies and no jobs without investment first, and when investors commit capital they’re buying dollars in the future. A policy of dollar devaluation would run counter to the very investment necessary for the businesses and jobs that the Administration would like to have materialize.
Applied to Cohn, while the dollar is once again not part of the Fed’s portfolio, his appointment to the central bank’s top spot would likely signal to markets that the Administration shares Cohn’s view that a weak dollar is in the best interests of the U.S., and worse, that it’s the Administration’s policy. To be blunt, if Trump embraces the discredited FDR, Nixon, Carter, Bush (43) policies in favor of a weak currency, his economic program will fail.
The Wrong Choice
The Trump economy will similarly be neutered if the Administration, like the Bush (43) administration, approaches the crucial message of the markets in situational fashion.
Getting right to the point, if we love Wall Street we should love it enough to let the insolvent fail. Just as Silicon Valley would be a tiny fraction of its prosperous self if its weakest start-ups (90% fail) were constantly being propped up with taxpayer dollars, so is the financial system needlessly weakened (and with it, the U.S. economy overall) when its insolvent institutions are having their errors cushioned with the money of others. Here again perception matters.
Cohn’s past disqualifies him despite his immense success at GS.
Whatever Cohn’s view of financial bailouts during what is now a period of relative calm, it’s fair to say that his past could cloud his judgement if Goldman once again finds itself in serious trouble, as it did in 2008.
On the above matter, the bailouts that needlessly caused a crisis in 2008 make Cohn the wrong choice for Fed Chair when we remember how much the Fed influenced the Bush administration’s wrongheaded decision to pursue bailouts back then. In that case, Cohn’s past disqualifies him despite his immense success at GS.
Lest we forget, Paulson was a rather fierce critic of bailouts until he wasn’t. Cohn is a risk for the same reason Paulson turned out to be. He might find a reason to save what shouldn’t be saved. Sorry, but business failure is a sign of progress, and this includes banks and investment banks. Even Goldman Sachs.  After that, the politics or optics of appointing a former GS #2 to the Fed’s top spot make the notion of doing so a non-starter.
And while Cohn has made the correct point that the Fed is but one entity in a world of credit (“They’re constrained by the rest of the world”), arguably the biggest disqualifier beyond the bad politics of his appointment concerns his very own politicking for the job. 19th century political economist Walter Bagehot once observed that central banking positions are desired by “vain, grasping men,” and sure enough Cohn is angling for the job.
He wants to “accomplish things” while at the Fed. And that’s very dangerous.
So did Ben Bernanke. Though a long-time Keynesian with views that were plainly of the left-wing variety, Bernanke, sensing a chance to be appointed Fed Chair, became a “Republican” overnight; suddenly courting prominent members of the right inside and outside Washington, D.C. Bernanke was plainly attracted to the prestige of being Fed Chairman, and his lust for relevance caused him to “do something” more than once while in control. We all know how his tenure turned out.
That Cohn wants the job of Fed Chairman is the surest sign that he, like Bernanke, wants to “accomplish things” while at the Fed. And that’s very dangerous. While the Fed’s relevance on a day to day basis is way overplayed, its role in the 2008 bailouts reminds us that on the odd days the Fed is capable of creating major damage. That Cohn plainly lusts for the job is a sign that he believes the Fed has expansive powers that need to be utilized. For that alone, Gary Cohn is the wrong choice for Fed Chairman.

He wants to “accomplish things” while at the Fed. And that’s very dangerous.
So did Ben Bernanke. Though a long-time Keynesian with views that were plainly of the left-wing variety, Bernanke, sensing a chance to be appointed Fed Chair, became a “Republican” overnight; suddenly courting prominent members of the right inside and outside Washington, D.C. Bernanke was plainly attracted to the prestige of being Fed Chairman, and his lust for relevance caused him to “do something” more than once while in control. We all know how his tenure turned out.
That Cohn wants the job of Fed Chairman is the surest sign that he, like Bernanke, wants to “accomplish things” while at the Fed. And that’s very dangerous. While the Fed’s relevance on a day to day basis is way overplayed, its role in the 2008 bailouts reminds us that on the odd days the Fed is capable of creating major damage. That Cohn plainly lusts for the job is a sign that he believes the Fed has expansive powers that need to be utilized. For that alone, Gary Cohn is the wrong choice for Fed Chairman.

About Gary Cohn


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cohn_(businessman%29
Gary D. Cohn (born August 27, 1960) is an American investment banker. He is currently the president and COO of investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs.
Early life and education
Gary Cohn was born to an eastern European Jewish family, the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn; and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer. Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.
Career
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio. After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990. He was named head of the commodities department, part of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) of the firm, in 1996; in September 2002, he was named head of the division. Since January 2004 Cohn was the co-head of global securities businesses and he was the co-head of Equities since 2003. He was head of the global securities businesses from December 2003, and became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, and director, in June 2006.
Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference which took place in San Francisco in February 2015. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, was on the program as a speaker, answering questions posed to him by Cohn.
Goldman Sachs has fallen under intense scrutiny for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels". Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs in late 2009 for meetings which included proposals – not adopted by the Greek government – to place debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."
Personality and work style
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220 lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing"[7] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.
When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.
Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:
"He’s a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips.”
Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive” value, explaining that a high ranking executive can’t be “all peaches and cream.”
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as “firm,” “strategic” and “driven.” Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough,” and added that “Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head.”
Philanthropy
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in finance.
In 2009, the Hillel building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife. It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.
Cohn has been a supporter of Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time Harlem RBI was given the chance to build their own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI’s director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.
In 2010 the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.
On June 17, 2013 Cohn was honored at the annual “Bid for Kids” gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is “very near and dear to his heart.”
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
Cohn has contributed his opinions on finance and business in prestigious journals and newspapers. In March, 2014 he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal discussing, “The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.
Personal life
Cohn is married to Lisa Pevaroff-Cohn. They have three daughters and they reside in New York City.

Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, is expected to be named director of the National Economic Council, which oversees economic policy in the White House.

Goldman Sachs’s outsize influence in Washington is about to get larger.The longtime second-in-command at Goldman Sachs, Gary D. Cohn, is expected to be named director of the National Economic Council, which oversees economic policy in the White House.Coming fast on the heels of the nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman partner, as Treasury secretary, it will mean that economic policy under the president-elect, Donald J. Trump, will be shaped chiefly by veterans of the Wall Street firm.The position that Mr. Cohn is expected to take up is one that has long been identified with Goldman and its influence in the capital.The role was established by President Bill Clinton and given to Goldman’s co-chairman at the time, Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Rubin’s co-chairman, Stephen Friedman, later held the position under President George W. Bush.

This time, however, the selection of a Goldman insider is at odds with statements made by Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. He repeatedly attacked the financial elite — and Goldman Sachs in particular. Continue reading the main story

In a commercial that ran in the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Trump warned about “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.” The face of Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein — Mr. Cohn’s longtime friend and collaborator — was among the images that flashed ominously on the screen.And Mr. Trump criticized both Hillary Clinton and a primary opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, over their ties to the investment bank. “I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Trump said at one primary debate. “They have total, total control” over Mr. Cruz, he said. “Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.”Since his election, however, Mr. Trump has stocked his future cabinet with a number of Goldman alumni, including Mr. Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and a former Goldman trader, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is now Mr. Trump’s chief strategist.Unlike those two, Mr. Cohn is a longtime top Goldman executive who was helping to guide the firm before and during the financial crisis.

                Outsiders, Insiders and Multimillionaires in Trump’s Cabinet            

                President-elect Donald J. Trump’s cabinet and top staff are shaping up to be a mix of wealthy Washington outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers who have been critical of the Obama administration.

In Mr. Cohn, Mr. Trump is not only turning to yet another Goldman hand — and a registered Democrat — but he is also choosing a financier whose thinking about the economy has stood in contrast to the president-elect’s more nationalistic views.At a conference in Florida  soon after the election, Mr. Cohn said the big problem facing the country and the world was a “global growth issue.”“We’re trying to solve it with domestic policy,” he said. “It’s not going to work.”While Mr. Trump has criticized companies that have moved their work force overseas, Mr. Cohn has been candid about Goldman’s international outlook: “We have a globalized work force, so when I need to go out and hire the incremental worker, I go out and look around the world and see where that incremental worker is available.”

Mr. Cohn, though, has agreed with Mr. Trump about the need to lighten the regulations that have been imposed on banks like Goldman since the financial crisis.In another interview at the conference, with CNBC, Mr. Cohn said he was “cautiously optimistic” about a Trump administration.“We’re all giving President-elect Trump and his transition team the benefit of the doubt,” Mr. Cohn said. “We’re all waiting to see what happens.”

Mr. Cohn, 56, rose through the ranks of Goldman as a trader and is known for his gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, which could help explain his rapport with the plain-spoken Mr. Trump.In recent years, Mr. Cohn has been in line to take over the firm from Mr. Blankfein, and his departure will open the door to a new crop of candidates looking to lead the firm.While he has been registered as a Democrat, Mr. Cohn has donated to both political parties. He has given tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees.

Yet more important, he has become friends with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser.The decision follows an extended courtship in which the Goldman executive visited with Mr. Trump three times, most recently on Thursday.Leaving Wall Street to take a top government post could provide a huge financial gain for Mr. Cohn.He would probably have to sell his Goldman holdings to avoid conflicts of interest with his new role, which would normally generate a big tax bill immediately. But tax regulations allow executive branch appointees to roll the proceeds of such a sale into Treasury securities and defer capital gains taxes.

Mr. Cohn owned 872,712 shares in Goldman as of Nov. 14, according to Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence. As of Friday afternoon’s stock price, that stake was worth about $209 million.Goldman Sachs has already been a beneficiary of the coming Trump administration. Mr. Trump has promised to push back on financial regulations passed since the financial crisis, which have come down particularly hard on Goldman. Since the election, shares of banks and other financial institutions have risen sharply; Goldman’s is up 34 percent.On Friday, Goldman’s shares edged up slightly.Mr. Cohn grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, the son of a real estate developer and electrical contractor. He later attended Gilmour Academy, a private school in the area, and then American University, though he has often spoken of his struggles with dyslexia.After a brief stint at U.S. Steel in his home state — to appease his father, Mr. Cohn said in a speech — he turned to the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983, where he eventually turned to trading silver. He was recruited to Goldman seven years later and became a fast-rising star at the investment bank, following the ascent of his friend Mr. Blankfein.In 1994, Mr. Cohn joined the vaunted partnership at Goldman, in a class that included a number of financial luminaries: Eric M. Mindich, now a hedge fund mogul; J. Michael Evans, formerly a top Goldman executive in China who is now at the Alibaba Group; and Mr. Mnuchin himself.By 2006, Mr. Cohn had become co-president and co-chief operating officer of the firm when Mr. Blankfein took the helm as chief executive. He took sole ownership of the No. 2 spot in 2009 and solidified his role as the heir apparent.Over his career, the 6-foot-3 Mr. Cohn has been known for a brusque and intimidating presence, reportedly looming over traders at their desks. But he has softened that approach over the years as he became more of a financial diplomat, flying to Washington, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and other centers of power.

How to Pass the Certified Occupational Health Nurse (COHN) Exam and Certified Occupational Health Nurse Specialist (COHN-S) Exam, using our easy step-by-step COHN test study guide, without weeks and months of endless studying...

Dear Friend,
On a beautiful late spring afternoon, this past year, a young woman received the devastating news. She had just gotten back her result on the COHN test. It was not what she had hoped for. In fact, it was not even close to the expectations she had considering her past experience and educational background.
She had failed.
Then she remembered her friends and felt even worse. She did not look forward to having to tell them the embarrassing news, especially after she had boasted that it was no big deal. She had been procrastinating about taking the exam because she hated standardized tests, and this only confirmed her hatred.
"What will I do now?" she thought with dismay, slowly realizing the harsh reality of her predicament and its upsetting implications on her future.
How to Solve the Problem
Unfortunately, this hypothetical situation occurs all the time. Someone thought they were going to breeze through the examination, told all their friends, made plans for their future, and then got an embarrassing reality check from the COHN test.
The Certified Occupational Health Nurse (COHN) Exam and Certified Occupational Health Nurse Specialist (COHN-S) Exam are quite simply an objective assessment of a test taker's requisite foundation of knowledge and skills.
COHN test scores are used by the American Board for Occupational Health Nurses, Inc. (ABOHN) as a uniform standard of qualification. While it may not be fair, all of a person's plans for the future may be dependent upon needing a certain COHN test score.
That is the whole purpose of the COHN Exam Secrets study guide: to give test takers the keys to understand how to succeed on the COHN test.
Our Study Guide for the COHN Test Is Unlike Any Other
If you'd like to get the COHN test score you deserve, to quit worrying about whether your score on the COHN test is "good enough," and to beat the test taking game so you can become a Certified Occupational Health Nurse or Certified Occupational Health Nurse-Specialist, then this might be the most important message you read this year.
Our comprehensive study guide for the COHN Exam & COHN-S Exam is written by our test experts, who painstakingly researched the topics and the concepts that you need to know to do your best on the COHN test. Our original research into the Certified Occupational Health Nurse (COHN) Exam and Certified Occupational Health Nurse Specialist (COHN-S) Exam, offered by the American Board for Occupational Health Nurses, Inc. (ABOHN), reveals the specific content areas and the essential skills that are critical for you to know on the COHN test. We've taken the information and developed a study guide that is guaranteed to help you be successful on the COHN test.
Now, we know you may be skeptical, so let us give you three good reasons we can back up what we claim:

The Three Reasons To Believe What We Say
The First Reason:
Our company's name is Mometrix Test Preparation, and we have a team of standardized test researchers who have worked on developing our study guide for the COHN test. The standards for who gets to work on the team are very strict- we demand the best for our customers, and only those who met our exacting standards made the cut. The dedicated research staff have years of combined experience in mastering the content and skills necessary to succeed on the toughest exams.
The Second Reason:
Some academic studies have revealed that test takers do not really benefit from the traditional test preparation process. But we knew there had to be a solution- if test takers were not doing well on the COHN test despite high intelligence, there had to be a set of secret keys to the test that would open the door of success for these test takers.
We believe we have succeeded in finding the secret keys of the exam. What we found was surprising, and in some cases ridiculously simple once explained to the average test taker.
We put the findings together in a thorough, concise study guide that we believe allows any test taker, at any skill level, to improve his or her results dramatically with a minimum of effort.
The Third Reason:
We created the product in part because we were frustrated by the options available to test takers who really wanted to do well on the COHN test.
A common approach is to TEACH the material, instead of TEACHING THE TEST. That's not necessarily good enough for the COHN test- you have to know how to apply the knowledge. Most test takers already have a general knowledge of the material that will be covered on the exam.
One reason some test takers do well on the day of the test is that they have made the critical connection between the material they learned and how to use the material to succeed on the COHN test.
Our guide addresses the difference between merely knowing the material and knowing how to use the material to perform on test day.
You're going to save time, money, and aggravation. You'll learn to avoid the mistakes and the bad strategies that you've been vulnerable to. Just for starters, here are some ways our product can help your score on the COHN test...

How to avoid panicking when you don't know the answer to a question- we offer a systematic method that will serve as the "lifeline" you need to minimize the time wasted on the test questions that leave you stumped
What to do about the tough questions that you have no clue how to answer- don't just give up, use the advice we offer to make sure you give yourself the best chance of getting the right answer
How to use our brainstorming method to get "inside the question" and reveal the hard-to-find clues and some of the subtle things you didn't realize you knew
Do you know what a "hedge phrase" is? Learn why looking for the key "weasel words" in the question can help identify the correct answer
Why "new information" in the answer choices almost always means that the answer choice is wrong- and the way to avoid this trick planted by the clever test writers

The two situations where you should NOT check your answers thoroughly

Test writers will often quote directly from the question in an answer- learn whether this is something you should trust or avoid
Why "extreme statements" in the answer choices are dead giveaways for wrong answers- find out how to detect the subtle differences between reasonable answers and the answers that are almost always wrong
Learn how to group your answer choices into "families" that often narrows down the pool of correct answers- this is a quick way to immediately eliminate one or two of the answer choices and increase your odds of getting the question right

I purchased the Secrets file, and I just wanted to let you know that I passed my test. I just want to thank you again, and hope you have continued success in your ventures. Sincerely, Paul L.
My name is Chris. I used the Secrets study guide for five days. The study guide made the test so easy to understand. Like you said this program is worth 100's of dollars. To me 1,000's!! THANKS, Chris G.
I just had to thank you guys for the test prep! I bought the guide as a last minute prep, I mean maybe 5 hours before the test. Like I said, I had ZERO preparation! I was nervous about the test let alone receiving the score I needed. I read the guide through only once before test time and needless to say, the only way I passed was thanks to your refresher!! Brian
I heard about your website from a friend. I am enrolled in a review course, and in hindsight, I wish I wouldn't have taken my review course and instead spent a fraction of the money on your program. Thank you! Zac L.

Warning: Always Look for These 6 Criteria
There is a lot of confusion surrounding studying for the COHN test, and standardized tests in general. In our opinion, these are the 6 criteria you should always look for in a study guide for the COHN test:
One: The guide must be written by writers who have painstakingly researched the topics and concepts needed to succeed on the COHN test. The blind cannot hope to lead the blind.
Two: The guide must be written in easy-to-use everyday language so all test takers can access the information.
Three: The guide must be to-the-point, with no fluff to distract the test taker from the truly important information.
Four: The guide must address the test first, the material second. If the material was the only thing that was important, then every test taker that understood the material should get a perfect score- that doesn't happen because there's a difference between simply knowing what's on the test and the way you perform on the test. You want a study guide to close that gap.
Five: The guide must motivate the test taker to actually study for the exam. If the guide is hard to read, the time spent studying will be slow and painful, and the results will be meager.
Six: The guide must be guaranteed- if you don't pass with flying colors, you get your money back- no questions asked.

You get at least 10 times your money's worth!
When you consider what's at stake with the exam, we believe the value of our study guide gives you at least ten times your money's worth.
In summary, here's what you get:

Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]

Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.[46]
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.[47]

Early life[edit]
Gary Cohn was born to an Eastern European Jewish family,[7][8] the son of Victor and Ellen Cohn;[9] and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. His father was an electrician who later became a real estate developer.[10] Cohn was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and attended four schools by the time he reached the sixth grade.[11] Cohn studied at Gilmour Academy, and received his bachelor's degree from American University's Kogod School of Business.[10]
Business Career[edit]
Cohn started his career at the U.S. Steel home products division in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] After a few months, he left U.S. Steel and started his career as an options dealer in the New York Mercantile Exchange.[12] He taught himself the basics of options by reading about it in the days between meeting the hiring manager and joining the New York Mercantile Exchange.[13]
Goldman Sachs[edit]
Cohn was recruited by Goldman Sachs in 1990.[14] In 1996, he was named head of the commodities department and in 2002, he was named the head of the entire Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Division (FICC) division. In 2003, he was named co-head of Equities and in January 2004, Cohn was named the co-head of global securities businesses .[15] He became President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and director in June 2006.[16]
In late 2009, Cohn led a delegation from Goldman Sachs to meetings with the government of Greece, which included proposals (that were not adopted) to push debt-due dates far into the future, "much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards."[17] Goldman Sachs had been scrutinized for creating or pitching products used by Greece to "obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in Brussels".[17]
In 2010, Cohn testified to Congress on the role of Goldman Sachs in the 2007-2008 financial crisis.[18] Cohn testified: "During the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business. We did not 'bet against our clients,' and the numbers underscore this fact."[19]
In February 2015, Cohn hosted the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. As host, Cohn asked questions of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., while Cook was on stage.[20]
Compensation[edit]
Cohn's salary at Goldman Sachs was US$22 million in 2014.[21] He received $21 million in 2015.[22]
He received a severance package worth around $285 million – mostly in stock – from Goldman Sachs upon leaving to join the administration of Donald Trump.[23] In the administration he took a salary of $30 thousand.[24][25][26]
National Economic Council director[edit]
Main article: National Economic Council (United States)
On January 20, 2017 Cohn took office as Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in President Donald Trump's administration, a position which did not require Congressional confirmation. By February 11, 2017, The Wall Street Journal described Cohn as an "economic-policy powerhouse"[27][28] and The New York Times called him Trump's "go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth".[29] With the confirmation of Trump's December 12, 2016 nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, being held back by Congressional hearings, Cohn filled in the "personnel vacuum" and pushed "ahead on taxes, infrastructure, financial regulation and replacing health-care law".[27] Had Cohn stayed at Goldman Sachs, some believed he would have become CEO when Lloyd Blankfein vacated that office.[27] His severance package at Goldman Sachs amounted to $285 million.[23] Additionally, Cohn sold a stake valued at $16 million in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank as of 2017.[30]
Cohn supports reinstating the Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate commercial and investment banking.[31][32]
Under the Trump administration Cohn has been cited by the press as a supporter of globalism and has been given nicknames such as "Globalist Gary" and "Carbon Tax Cohn".[33] Along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell they have been referred to by opponents as the "Wall Street-wing" of the Trump administration.[33] He is stated as being at odds with the populist faction led by Steven Bannon.[33][34]
Personality and work style[edit]
Critics of Cohn attribute to him an arrogant, aggressive, abrasive and risk-prone work style. They see his "6-foot 3-inch & 220lbs" as intimidating, as he might "sometimes hike up one leg, plant his foot on a trader's desk, his thigh close to the employee's face and ask how markets were doing."[14] According to former Bear Stearns Asset Management CEO Richard Marin, Cohn's arrogance is at the root of the problem.

When you become arrogant, in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody's a counterparty, not a customer, not a client.[14]

Cohn's supporters see these qualities as advantages. Michael Ovitz, co-founder and former chairman of Creative Artists Agency and former president of The Walt Disney Company, stated that he is impressed with Cohn. Ovitz said:

"He's a trader. He has that whole feel in his body and brain and fingertips."[14]

Ovitz sees Cohn's toughness as a "positive" value, explaining that a high-ranking executive can't be "all peaches and cream."[10][14]
Donna Redel, who was Chairman of the Board of the New York Mercantile Exchange when Cohn worked there as a silver trader, remembers Cohn as "firm," "strategic" and "driven." Martin Greenberg, her predecessor, said Cohn "was tough," and added that "Gary got in with the right people, worked his ass off and used his head."[14]
Personal life[edit]
Cohn is married to Lisa A Pevaroff-Cohn.[35][36] They have three daughters and reside in New York City.[9][12]
Philanthropy[edit]
Cohn and his wife are founding board members of the New York University Child Study Center. The couple funded the Pevaroff Cohn Professorship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in 1999. He financed the Gary D. Cohn Endowed Research Professorship in Finance at American University, his alma mater.[37]
In 2009, the Hillel International building at Kent State University was named the Cohn Jewish Student Center in recognition of a gift from Cohn and his wife.[38] It is the first Hillel building built directly on the campus of a state university.[39]
Cohn has been a supporter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and has supported Harlem RBI since 2011. At that time, Harlem RBI was given the chance to build its own charter school. Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees and Harlem RBI director Rich Berlin asked Cohn if he could help them raise the capital they needed to build the school.[40]
In December 2012, Cohn attended the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief which raised money for the Robin Hood Relief fund to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.[41]
Cohn is active as a trustee of his alma mater, American University, and of his school, Gilmour Academy.[42]
In 2010, the Hospital for Joint Diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center named Cohn the chairman of the HJD Advisory Board.[43]
On June 17, 2013, Cohn was honored at the annual "Bid for Kids" gala in order to raise funds for Harlem RBI and the DREAM charter school. Cohn said in an interview that Harlem RBI is a project that is "very near and dear to his heart."[40]
Published works[edit]
Cohn has written editorials in several popular finance newspapers, websites, and blogs.[citation needed] In March 2014, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, discussing "The Responsible Way to Rein in Super-Fast Trading."[44]
In a June 2015 Financial Times op-ed, Cohn argued that illiquid assets could make clearing houses "part of the problem" in a liquidity crisis.[45]
Memberships[edit]
Cohn is a member of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.[46]
Cohn is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.[47]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Every time you get into a new job, new location, you have an amazing opportunity in front of you. You get to play dumb for as long as people will allow you to play dumb. You get to ask all the dumb questions, you get to ask multiple people the dumb questions, and you get to make mistakes. That's how you stand out in the crowd.
Gary Cohn


Time,
Mistakes,
Opportunity



















Keep yourself motivated. You've got to be motivated, you've got to wake up every day and understand what that day is about; you've got to have personal goals - short term goals, intermediate goals, and long term goals. Be flexible in getting to those goals, but if you do not have goals, you will not achieve them.
Gary Cohn


Goals,
Day,
Short
























There is a finite group of major financial players... and overall, the best thing for all of us is to be in an industry that's well respected, well regarded, and well thought of.

I don't think it's good for anyone to be in the public light - for negative reasons.

China is the big economic engine in Asia, so what happens is, as China growth expands, these countries in the periphery of China, whether it be Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, they end up growing with China because they become big exporters.
Gary Cohn


Growth,
End,
Growing



















Upon graduation, believe it or not, I had no job. I had no interviews. I had no prospects. I had no worries. What I did have, I had passion. I had enormous passion. I had passion for financial markets. I had fallen in love with financial markets.
Gary Cohn


Love,
Passion,
Graduation



















Have a goal. Know where you want to end up. Knowing where you want to end up is a lot easier than figuring out how to start and how to get there. You will figure out how to get there. Do not chart your career. Trust me; you do not want to chart your career.
Gary Cohn


Trust,
Goal,
End
