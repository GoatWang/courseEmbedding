Robert B. Jones













                    
                    Robert B. Jones was born in Houston, Texas in 1946. He is an accomplished futuristic artist and illustrator and a former Chinese linguist for the US Air Force. He grew up in Washington, D.C. and has worked in some of the most security-sensitive places in the country, including the White House, Camp David, and the National Security Agency. His novel "A Chip In Time" is set in the year 2075 in Las Vegas and provides a realistic and harrowing look into the future of Sin City. His second novel "The Hand Is Quicker" featuring detective Danny DeVille continues the exploits of the hero from the first book, with a new case, and, of course, new dangers."The Belt Loop" (Book One) offers a look inside the Colonial Navy of Elber Prime and is set against the star-rich area known as Orion's Belt. This space adventure is packed with realistic action and high-adventure in 2789."The Belt Loop" (Book Two) continues the high-adventure saga of the Colonial Navy of Elber Prime with a resurgence of the Varson Empire, a nomadic race of humanoids hell-bent on destroying the human race and avenging their losses from an earlier conflict."The Belt Loop" (Book Three) finds the Colonial Navy suffering tremendous losses at the hands of the new Varson madman, Bale Phatie. His recently developed "Planet Killer" weapon poses a serious problem for Uri Haad and the rest of the Admiralty and Haad is running out of time to put down the Varson uprising. Will he succeed? Is the Colonial Empire doomed?Jones currently lives in Henderson, Nevada and is busy with his sixth novel.
