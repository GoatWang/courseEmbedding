Sessa Capital Files Detailed Investor Presentation on Ashford 
      Hospitality Prime




Highlights what Sessa Believes are Ashford Prime’s Failed Track 
      Record of Corporate Governance and Financial Performance, and Efforts to 
      Obstruct Common Shareholder Voting Rights


Sessa’s Highly Qualified Director Nominees are Committed to 
      Representing the Rights of All Ashford Prime Shareholders


Urges Shareholders to Vote the WHITE Proxy Card






March 23, 2016 10:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. (“Sessa”), the third largest shareholder of 
      Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE:AHP) (“Ashford Prime” or the 
      “Company”), today announced the release of an investor presentation in 
      connection with Sessa’s slate of five highly qualified nominees for 
      election to the Board of Directors of Ashford Prime at the Company’s 
      upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. The Company has yet to publicly 
      announce the scheduled date of the annual meeting, but has disclosed in 
      response to Sessa’s court case that the meeting is anticipated to occur 
      the week of June 6, 2016.
    

      The presentation outlines why Sessa believes immediate change in Board 
      composition is needed at Ashford Prime, whose shareholders have suffered 
      a destruction of value under the watch of the incumbent Board and its 
      Chairman & CEO Monty Bennett. In contrast to what Sessa views as the 
      incumbent Board’s history of caving in to Chairman Bennett and Ashford 
      Prime’s external advisor Ashford Inc., Sessa’s nominees will be solely 
      aligned with the interests of Ashford Prime’s shareholders. The 
      presentation details why Sessa believes it is time for Ashford Prime to 
      turn the page on the poor governance practices of the past and elect a 
      set of highly qualified new directors.
    

      The Investor Presentation is available on the “Presentation” tab of 
      FixAshfordPrime.com and is being filed with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission.
    

      Sessa urges shareholders to vote the WHITE proxy card for its proposed 
      slate of five board nominees, who possess significant experience in the 
      areas of real estate investing, lodging industry management, capital 
      markets and corporate governance.

SESSA CAPITAL APPEALS TEXAS COURT RULING
 
Sessa Commences Appeal of Court Decision
Denying Stockholders a Choice of Director Nominees
 
New York – May 23, 2016 –
Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. (“Sessa”), owner of 8.2% of the outstanding common shares of Ashford Hospitality Prime,
Inc. (NYSE: AHP) (“Ashford Prime” or the “Company”), today announced that it has commenced an appeal of
the recent decisions by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in connection with Sessa’s proxy
contest with Ashford Prime. The appeal is being taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Sessa intends
to request that the District Court’s orders be stayed and that Ashford Prime’s annual stockholders meeting, which is
currently scheduled for June 10, 2016, be postponed until after the appeal is resolved. Sessa also intends to request that its
appeal be expedited.
 
The District Court held that Maryland’s
business judgment rule protects the decision of the Ashford Prime board to refuse to allow the Sessa nominees to stand for election
against the incumbent directors. In its decisions, the District Court noted that Ashford Prime’s board contends Sessa has
undisclosed plans for the Company that it did not adequately include in its nominee questionnaires in January 2016 or upon further
request. The District Court held that the board “could rationally believe” such plans existed, although the District
Court made no finding as to what those plans might be.
 
The District Court issued a preliminary
injunction prohibiting Sessa from soliciting proxies for its nominees. Accordingly, Sessa will not solicit proxies for its nominees
unless permitted to do so following the outcome of the appeal and the motions filed in connection with the appeal.
 
John Petry, Sessa’s principal, commented,
“We are deeply disappointed in the District Court’s decision, which will deny Ashford Prime stockholders the opportunity
to participate in a competitive director election. We believe that we have been transparent in our disclosures and that all of
our plans and proposals for the Company required to be disclosed under the federal securities laws have been fully disclosed in
our filings on Schedule 13D and in our proxy materials. We intend to vigorously pursue our appeal of the District Court’s
decisions and hope that the courts will ultimately permit Ashford Prime’s stockholders to decide which directors should be
their chosen representatives on the Company’s board.”

Sessa Capital Files Detailed Investor Presentation On Ashford Hospitality Prime






Business Wire




Mar 23, 2016 10:30 AM EDT













 




























































  Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ("Sessa"), the third largest shareholder of Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE:AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company"), today announced the release of an investor presentation in connection with Sessa's slate of five highly qualified nominees for election to the Board of Directors of Ashford Prime at the Company's upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. The Company has yet to publicly announce the scheduled date of the annual meeting, but has disclosed in response to Sessa's court case that the meeting is anticipated to occur the week of June 6, 2016.  The presentation outlines why Sessa believes immediate change in Board composition is needed at Ashford Prime, whose shareholders have suffered a destruction of value under the watch of the incumbent Board and its Chairman & CEO Monty Bennett. In contrast to what Sessa views as the incumbent Board's history of caving in to Chairman Bennett and Ashford Prime's external advisor Ashford Inc., Sessa's nominees will be solely aligned with the interests of Ashford Prime's shareholders. The presentation details why Sessa believes it is time for Ashford Prime to turn the page on the poor governance practices of the past and elect a set of highly qualified new directors.  The Investor Presentation is available on the "Presentation" tab of FixAshfordPrime.com and is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Sessa urges shareholders to vote the WHITE proxy card for its proposed slate of five board nominees, who possess significant experience in the areas of real estate investing, lodging industry management, capital markets and corporate governance.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT  Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ("Sessa Capital") and the other Participants (as defined below) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a definitive proxy statement and an accompanying WHITE proxy card to be used to solicit proxies for, among other matters, the election of its slate of director nominees at the 2016 annual shareholders meeting of Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. ("AHP"). The participants in the proxy solicitation include Sessa Capital, Sessa Capital GP, LLC, Sessa Capital IM, L.P., Sessa Capital IM GP, LLC, John E. Petry, Lawrence A. Cunningham, Philip B. Livingston, Daniel B. Silvers, and Chris D. Wheeler (collectively, the "Participants").

ELECTRONIC ORDER: Defendants have filed an Emergency Motion to Compel the Production of Documents 59 . After reviewing the motion, the Court determines that the following expedited briefing schedule is most appropriate to facilitate this motion's prompt and efficient disposition. Plaintiffs must file a written response by 9:00 a.m. Central on May 2, 2016. The response should include a detailed affidavit or affidavits (or declarations) or other evidence to fully enable the Court to determine whether the documents that Defendants challenge are protected work product or attorney-client privileged communications as to which the privilege and/or protection have not been waived, including (without revealing any protected work product or privileged information) a detailed description of the documents in dispute and a statement of specific and precise reasons for Plaintiffs' claim of protection from disclosure as to each document based on the governing standards. Plaintiffs must be prepared on Monday, May 2, 2016 to provide the challenged documents to the Court for in camera review if -- but only if -- the Court so requests after reviewing the response. Unless the Court informs the parties otherwise, the Court will rule on the motion without a hearing, oral argument, or reply. Plaintiffs should be prepared to produce any documents or electronically stored information at issue in the motion by as early as the morning of May 3, 2016 if the Court grants the motion in whole or in part.

ELECTRONIC ORDER: The Court DENIES in part and GRANTS in part Defendants' Emergency Motion to Compel the Production of Documents 59 . The motion is denied as moot as to the board materials at issue and correspondence with Notre Dame based on Plaintiffs' representation that Plaintiffs have produced all the documents that Defendants seek regarding board meetings and minutes as well as correspondence with Notre Dame. The motion is denied as to the documents reflected in privilege log entries 18, 98, 127, 963, 971, 1082, 1083, 1084, 1085, 1139, 1308, and 1309 because Plaintiffs represent, and the Declaration of David Brooks explains, that those documents are not in fact responsive to Defendants' document requests.The motion is moot as to the documents reflected in privilege log entries 33, 77, 140, 164, 217, 226, 281, 311, 366, 414, and 1350 because Plaintiffs report that they have produced those documents. After carefully reviewing the parties' filings, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have established, through the Declaration of David Brooks and (as necessary and appropriate) an in camera review of some of the documents, that certain of the remaining 44 documents at issue are protected from disclosure, either entirely or with redactions, by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product protection -- specifically, those reflected in privilege log entries 36, 108, 121, 123, 146, 148, 176, 178, 180, 183, 215, 327, 350, 500, 1050, 1051, 1052, 1053, 1070, 1071, 1136, 1164, 1165, 1168, 1169, 1170, 1172, 1173, 1190, 1248, 1346, 1347, 1841, 1853, 1867, 1882, and 1979. The Court denies the motion as to those documents as to any challenge to Plaintiffs withholding or redactions based on attorney-client privilege and/or work-product protection. After carefully reviewing the parties' filings, including conducting an in camera review as to certain of these documents, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have not established the existence and applicability of a so-called business strategy or white knight privilege or immunity under governing law in this case and cannot redact (or entirely withhold) portions of the documents reflected in privilege log entries 36, 109, 183, 249, 280, and 991 based on an assertion that those portions, while not attorney work product or attorney-client privileged communications, constitute proprietary, confidential strategic discussions. The Court grants the motion as to those portions of those documents, which portions must be produced unredacted.After carefully reviewing the parties' filings, including conducting an in camera review, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have not established that the documents reflected in privilege log entries 11 and 12 are protected from disclosure, either entirely or with redactions, by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product protection. Specifically, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to establish that draft board meeting minutes contain legal analysis and attorney work product simply because they were prepared by outside counsel. The Court grants the motion as to those documents. After carefully reviewing the parties' filings, including conducting an in camera review, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have not established that the document reflected in privilege log entries 244, 249, and 280 are protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection. The Court grants the motion as to those documents. After carefully reviewing the parties' filings, including conducting an in camera review, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have not established that the documents reflected in privilege log entries 109 and 991 are protected from disclosure in their entirety by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product protection. Rather, the document logged as entry 109 must be reproduced with redaction of only the email to Mr. Brooks and not the emails being forwarded to Mr. Brooks, and the document logged as entry 991 must be reproduced with redaction only of the draft questions and responses that reflect legal advice, legal analysis, and work product. The Court accordingly grants the motion in part as to these documents. All documents required by this order to be produced or reproduced must be produced by 9:00 a.m. Central on May 3, 2016. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(5), all parties will bear their own costs and fees in connection with Defendants' Emergency Motion to Compel the Production of Documents 59 .

Sessa Capital Highlights Ashford Prime's Admissions Of Corporate Governance Weaknesses






Business Wire




May 10, 2016 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ("Sessa"), owner of 8.2% of the outstanding common shares of Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE:AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company"), today commented on the Company's announcement of a series of last-minute governance proposals that Sessa believes will do little to address the issues that have plagued Ashford Prime since its 2013 spin-off.  Sessa believes the incumbent directors' newest proposal, that Monty Bennett step down as CEO, is merely a ruse to suggest that real governance changes are underway. At most companies, a CEO change would be meaningful. But this is not the case at Ashford Prime, where the incumbent directors relinquished their power to appoint the CEO less than a year ago by approving a highly unusual contractual arrangement. In Sessa's view, changing the Company's CEO will be merely symbolic because, by contract, any CEO will be appointed by Ashford Inc and therefore beholden to Monty Bennett in his role as Ashford Inc's Chairman and CEO. Sessa believes this arrangement renders the Company's latest proposal a mere cosmetic change that leaves Monty Bennett's power over Ashford Prime unchecked.  Sessa also questions the incumbent directors' campaign promise that they might appoint new independent directors if they are re-elected. Sessa agrees that truly independent directors are needed at Ashford Prime, but Sessa believes that the governance problem at Ashford Prime isn't an insufficient number of directors, but rather the conflicts of the existing "independent" directors. The incumbent directors were all identified by Chairman Bennett and have personal, professional and financial intersections with him and his other companies. A larger board would be unwieldy in size, more expensive and chosen by incumbent directors who have already failed to protect shareholders' interests. Sessa believes that shareholders should be wary of director additions sourced by a board that includes:   A director who is a direct subordinate of Chairman Bennett and has worked for him for nearly 15 years;   A high school friend of more than 30 years of Chairman Bennett who serves on the Company's Compensation Committee;   A director whose independence was questioned by RiskMetrics while serving as a director of Ashford Prime's predecessor because of his receipt of a $100,000 bonus;   A director whose affiliated company sold assets to Ashford Prime's predecessor, which later took $50 million in impairment charges on the purchase; and   Two political cronies of Chairman Bennett, Texas State Representatives who raised so much campaign money from Chairman Bennett that he was a leading individual donor to each.    For shareholders who, like Sessa, believe new independent directors are needed, electing Sessa's highly qualified nominees on June 10 is a more direct and immediate path to accomplish this objective.
