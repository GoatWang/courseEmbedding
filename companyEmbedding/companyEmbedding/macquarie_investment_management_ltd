								A world of investments for your clients
							














With managed funds from Macquarie, you can help your clients gain exposure to Australian and international shares, fixed income, infrastructure securities and alternatives.











Finding opportunities that matter for clients







Macquarie Investment Management
A global asset manager with offices throughout Australia, the United States, Europe and Asia, we prioritise autonomy and accountability at the team level in pursuit of opportunities that matter for clients. Our conviction-based, long-term approach to investing has led clients to entrust us to manage more than $300 billion1. In Australia we offer both Macquarie strategies and those managed by other world-class investment managers through the Macquarie Professional Series.











Macquarie Professional Series
Macquarie has searched the world for what we believe are the most outstanding investment managers and have partnered with a select few to bring their signature investment strategies to you and your clients.
They include Analytic Investors LLC, Arrowstreet Capital, Independent Franchise Partners, Polaris Capital Management LLC, Walter Scott & Partners and Winton Capital Management.




























About Australian shares
For more than a quarter of a century, Macquarie has been a leading manager of Australian shares. Our team of more than 25 analysts rigorously researches and evaluates ASX-listed companies. We only invest in those we believe offer your clients the best value and opportunities.



 Macquarie High Conviction Fund A concentrated portfolio of our best ideas in Australian equities  Provides your clients with exposure to a concentrated portfolio of Australian shares that our investment team believes will generate the highest returns. The team's style-neutral, bottom-up portfolio construction process creates increased opportunity for more consistent long-term returns by not depending on the growth and value cycles of the share market. 


 Macquarie Australian Small Companies Fund Seeking exposure to the big opportunities in small companies  Aims to invest in a diversified selection of some of the fastest-growing Australian companies. Give your clients the potential for consistent returns, capital growth and some income. Our investment team identifies potentially attractive 'value' and 'growth' stocks through proprietary quantitative screening and an intense fundamental research process. 

















About international shares
Most of the world's largest and most successful companies list on exchanges outside Australia. Also Asia's emerging markets provide exciting growth opportunities. We've searched the world for the most outstanding investment managers who can help your clients tap into the most exciting investment opportunities, wherever they may be.



 Analytic Global Managed Volatility Fund Global equities with low volatility  Aims to provide a low-volatility and long-term global investment option. . The fund offers the potential for consistent above-index returns over the long term and provides access to Analytic, a pioneer in quantitatively-driven, low-volatility equity investment management. 


 Arrowstreet Global Equity Fund Long-term global equities exposure  Take a long-term approach to investing in global equities. Arrowstreet's fund managers take an active quantitative investment approach that aims to add value through varying market conditions. The fund invests in companies from developed and emerging markets. Macquarie offers unhedged and hedged versions of the fund. 




 IFP Global Franchise Fund Access to leading international brands  IFP's fund managers take a low turn-over, buy-and-hold approach to investing for the fund, with a focus on value and capital preservation. This means they only invest in approximately 20 to 40 high quality companies at a time and focus on businesses with high free cash flow and dominant intangible assets such as a brand, patent, or licences. Macquarie offers unhedged and hedged versions of the fund. 


 Macquarie Asia New Stars No.1 Fund Uncovering new opportunities in Asia  Your clients can capitalise on the potential capital growth of small and mid-sized companies in the world's most dynamic economic region. The fund provides exposure to small to mid-sized businesses in Asia, (excluding Japan), and aims to provide both capital growth and some income. Macquarie's fund managers take a rigorous, bottom-up approach to selecting stock and identifying investments with low valuations and high growth potential. 




 Polaris Global Equity Fund Access a diversified portfolio of value-oriented global equities  Provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of global equities that Polaris believes are the most attractive value opportunities. The fund is actively managed, using a benchmark-unaware, bottom-up, research-driven approach with a focus on sustainable free cash flow. It generally holds between 65 and 100 securities of globally-listed companies, including those in emerging markets and small capitalisation companies. 


 Walter Scott Emerging Markets Fund Access growth companies in emerging markets  Help your clients access the high-growth potential of companies in emerging markets. Walter Scott's bottom-up, fundamental approach to investing focuses on companies from developing economies that offer long-term growth potential. Walter Scott's experienced fund managers pay particular attention to factors such as strong earnings growth, high return on equity and high free cash flow. 




 Walter Scott Global Equity Fund High-growth companies in global markets  Walter Scott scours global markets for what it believes are the world's best companies. Its fundamental, bottom-up investment approach combines detailed financial analysis with business and industry analysis. Your clients can benefit from Walter Scott's selective stock picking and ability to target companies capable of sustainable wealth generation. Macquarie offers unhedged and hedged versions of the fund. 

















About fixed income
Fixed income investments, such as government and corporate bonds, can provide regular income and capital growth for your clients and can help mitigate the risk of investing too heavily in one asset class. Macquarie has over 30 years of fixed income experience and can offer your clients some of what we believe are the best opportunities from around the world.



 Macquarie Diversified Fixed Interest Fund A defensive and multi-sector bond solution  Offers exposure to a diversified portfolio of fixed interest and credit-based investments. Macquarie's fund managers aim to provide a regular income and some capital growth by actively identifying outperforming fixed interest and credit sectors. The fund also minimises currency volatility through hedging. 


 Macquarie Income Opportunities Fund An income solution with a focus on preserving capital  Attempts to provide a regular income at a better rate of return than bank or term deposits by giving your clients exposure to interest-bearing securities issued by a range of different companies. The fund's capital preservation focus means it invests in a diversified portfolio of highly liquid securities. 

















About alternatives
Governments and companies increasingly use private investment to fund large infrastructure projects such as roads, airports and hospitals. Investing in this important asset class offers your clients the potential for stable, inflation-linked income, capital growth and portfolio diversification. Meanwhile, our absolute return fund also has the potential to generate positive returns, even in falling markets.



 Macquarie International Infrastructure Securities Fund Exposure to the global infrastructure assets  Offers your clients a global portfolio of listed infrastructure securities. The fund invests across both developed and emerging markets, as well as across infrastructure sectors. Investment decisions are only made after Macquarie's large specialist infrastructure team has conducted intensive fundamental research. Macquarie offers unhedged and hedged versions of the fund. 


 Winton Global Alpha Fund Diversification to traditional portfolios  Aims to generate long-term returns for your clients through a specialised managed futures trading strategy. With the potential to generate positive returns in both rising and falling markets, the fund can provide valuable portfolio diversification benefits. Winton's investment team's model-driven, automated approach to trading involves analysing market trends and then developing mathematically-based strategies to capitalise on them.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
