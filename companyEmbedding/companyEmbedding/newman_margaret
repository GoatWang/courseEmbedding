 “Health is the expansion of consciousness.” - Newman, 1983



INTRODUCTION


 The theory of health as expanding consciousness stems from Rogers' theory of unitary human beings.  


 The theory of health as expanding consciousness was stimulated by concern for those for whom health as the absence of disease or disability is not possible, (Newman, 2010). 


The theory has progressed to include the health of all persons regardless of the presence or absence of disease,  (Newman, 2010). 


The theory asserts that every person in every situation, no matter how disordered and hopeless it may seem, is part of the universal process of expanding consciousness – a process of becoming more of oneself, of finding greater meaning in life, and of reaching new dimensions of connectedness with other people and the world,  (Newman, 2010).

Link to her Biography 

THEORY DEVELOPMENT 
She was influenced by following theorists:

Martha Rogers

 Martha        Roger’s theory of Unitary Human Beings was the main basis of the        development of her theory, Health as Expanding Consciousness

Itzhak   Bentov – The concept of evolution of consciousness
Arthur Young – The Theory of Process
David Bohm – The Theory of Implicate

ASSUMPTIONS

 Health encompasses conditions heretofore described as illness, or, in medical terms, pathology 
 These pathological conditions can be considered a manifestation of the total pattern of the individual
 The pattern of the individual that eventually manifests itself as pathology is primary and exists prior to structural or functional changes
 Removal of the pathology in itself will not change the pattern of the indivdual 
 If becoming ill is the only way an individual's pattern can manifest itself, then that is health for that person 
 Health is an expansion of consciousness.  

DESCRIPTION OF THE THEORY 


“The theory of health as       expanding consciousness (HEC) was stimulated by concern for those for whom       health as the absence of disease or disability is not possible. Nurses       often relate to such people: people facing the uncertainty, debilitation,       loss and eventual death associated with chronic illness. The theory has       progressed to include the health of all persons regardless of the presence       or absence of disease. The theory asserts that every person in every       situation, no matter how disordered and hopeless it may seem, is part of       the universal process of expanding consciousness – a process of becoming       more of oneself, of finding greater meaning in life, and of reaching new       dimensions of connectedness with other people and the world” (Newman,       2010).


Humans are open to the whole energy system of  the universe and constantly interacting with the energy. With this process of  interaction humans are evolving their individual pattern of whole.


According to Newman understanding  the pattern is essential. The expanding  consciousness is the pattern recognition.


The manifestation of disease depends on the  pattern of individual so the pathology of the diseases exists before the  symptoms appear so removal of disease symptoms does not change the individual  structure.


Newman also redefines nursing according to  her nursing is the process of recognizing the  individual in relation to environment and it is the process of understanding of  consciousness.


The nurse helps to understand       people to use the power within to develop the higher level of       consciousness.


Thus it helps to realize       the disease process, its recovery and prevention.


Newman also explains the       interrelatedness of time, space and movement.


Time and space are the       temporal pattern of the individual, both have complementary relationship.


Humans are constantly       changing through time and space and it shows unique pattern of reality.


NURSING PARADIGMS
Health 

“Health  and illness are synthesized as health - the fusion on one state of being  (disease) with its opposite (non-disease) results in what can be regarded as  health”.

Nursing

Nursing  is “caring in the human health experience”.
Nursing  is seen as a partnership between the nurse and client, with both grow in the  “sense of higher levels of consciousness” 

Human

“The human is unitary,        that is cannot be divided into parts, and is inseparable from the larger        unitary field”
“Persons as individuals,        and human beings as a species are identified by their patterns of        consciousness”…
 “The person does not possess consciousness-the        person is consciousness”.
 Persons are  “centers of consciousness” within an overall pattern of expanding consciousness”  

Environment

Environment is described        as a “universe of open systems”

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
Strengths

Can be applied in any        setting

Abstract
Multi-dimensional
Qualitative 
Little  discussion on environment

	        CRITIQUE
Clarity

 Semantic clarity is evident in the definitions, descriptions, and dimensions of the concepts of the theory.  

 Simplicity 

 The deeper meaning of the theory of health as expending consciousness is complex. 
The theory as a whole must be understood, nut just the isolated concepts.  

Generality

  The theory has been applied in several different cultures 
It  is applicable across the spectrum of nursing care situations. 

 Empirical Precision  

 Quantitative methods are inadequate in capturing the dynamic, changing nature of this theory. 

 Derivable Consequences 

Newman's theory provides an evolving guide for all health-related disciplines. 

CONCLUSION
Newman's theory can be conceptualized as

A grand theory of nursing 
Humans  can not be divided into parts 
Health  is central to the theory  and is seen  “and is seen as a process of developing awareness of self and the environment” 
“Consciousness  is a manifestation of an evolving pattern of person-environment interaction”

Inspiration for a Theory Health as ExpandingConsciousness "Health Encompasses the Whole Person" "Health is a process of expanding consciousness" References Hilary Ledet, R.N. "Health and illness as a unitary process" Theory of Consciousness in Margaret Newman's own words Support of the Theory Experience with my mother’s illness before entering nursing My study with Martha Rogers My fascination with the concepts of movement, time, space and consciousness as I worked with rehab patients The opportunity to present the theory at a 1978 conference, which compelled me to put it all together (Newman, 2008) Assumptions of the Theory Person: Health: Environment: Nurse: Expanding Consciousness: Defining Terms used in Theory Born on October 10, 1933 1962: Bachelor's degree at the University of Tennessee 1964: Master's degree at the University of California 1971: Doctoral degree at New York University a process of becoming more of oneself, of finding greater meaning in life,and of reaching new dimensions of connectedness with other people and the world (Newman, 2008) 1.

These pathological conditions can be considered a manifestation of the total pattern of the individual. 3. The pattern of the individual that eventually manifests itself as pathology is primary and exists prior to structural or functional changes. David Bohm’s Theory of Implicate Order: Ilya Prigogine’s Theory of Dissipative Structures: Arthur Young’s Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness: "A system fluctuates in an orderly manner until the occurrence of a disruptive event (internal and/or external), at which time the system moves in self-organizing but seemingly random, disorderly ways until it chooses a new direction at a higher level of organization" (Newman,  2008). "A person moves through stages of consciousness involving the loss of freedom in the development of self-identity until a turning point is reached when the 'old rules' don't work anymore. The life task is to discover the 'new rules' and move toward increasing freedom and higher consciousness" (Newman, 2013). "an unseen, underlying pattern as the primary order of reality; he called this the implicate order. The explicate order is a manifestation of the implicate order." Health and illness as a unity process" (Newman, 2013). Martha Rogers The Science of Unitary Human Beings: "The health of a human being is a unitary phenomenon, an evolving pattern of human-environment" (McEwen and Wills, 2011). Itzhak Bentov's Pendulum Theory: "Life is a process of expanding consciousness. Consciousness can be seen in the quality of interaction of the system with the environment" (Newman, 2008). The necessity of unconditional love, which manifests itself in sensitivity to self, attention to others, and creativity. The shift from a problem orientation to pattern recognition is a shift to a higher dimension of knowledge. It is important that the practitioner of nursing incorporate the knowledge of earlier realms as special cases of the pattern of the whole. viewed as the totality of the life process, which is evolving toward expanded consciousness ; the fusion of one state of being with its opposite (non-disease) results in health (Newman, 2008)  role of the nurse as a caring, pattern-recognizing presence; and health as a transformative process to more inclusive consciousness (Newman, 2008).  The Nurse develops multifaceted levels of awareness to be able to sense the underlying pattern in a person’s physical appearance and symptoms, emotional conveyances, spiritual insights, mental ponderings, tone of voice, movements, etc. One views the client and environment as unitary, evolving patterns  Nurses attend to the physical manifestations and patterns of interaction of their patients to sense the implicate pattern. . . 1978: Presented my theory for the first time at a conference in New York  Caring in this perspective is nonjudgmental, noninterventionist, and involves being with rather than just doing for; caring in its deepest, most respectful sense. Every person in every situation, no matter how disordered and hopeless it may seem, is part of the universal process of expanding consciousness. 4. Removal of the pathology in itself will not change the pattern of the individual 5. If becoming "ill" is the only way an individual's pattern can manifest itself, then that is health for that person. 6.

Design and Methods/Participants: Research-as-praxis method7 families with children with special needs, at least 5 years old, living in family unit since birth, not hospitalized. If dependent on parents or guardians “child” could be over the age of 21. Relationship to Health as Expanding Consciousness (HEC) Addition of the term practitioner-researcher andfamily participant (FP) emphasizes the praxis unity.Used Prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures tointerpret family patterns.The PRs and FPs experienced pattern recognition, insights and transformations.Pattern recognition occurred in the nurse-family partnership. Research Question: The purpose of the study was to evaluate a new pre-surgerynursing practice model (PNPM) developed from HEC, transpersonal caring, and reflective practice. Design and Methods/Participants: Qualitative evaluation study using phenomenologicalmethods for data generation and analysis.4 nurses and 31 patients participated in the study. Nurseswere staff in the pre-surgical area of a hospital and the patients were waiting for elective surgery. Relationship to Health as Expanding Consciousness (HEC) Nurse presence with the patients facilitated the personal transformationsthat occurred.Nurses came to see meaning in their actions as they apprehended the wholeness of the person-environment interrelationship. The change in nursing practice was a powerful experience. Research Question: To understand how to better care for Hmong women with diabetes using nursing praxis. Design and Methods/Participants: Qualitative phenomenological design specifically community-based collaborative action research based on HEC. 5 Hmong women with Type 2 diabetes and HgbA1c levels over 7.0 wererecruited in a community health clinic Relationship to Health as Expanding Consciousness (HEC) HEC can facilitate understanding of the larger community pattern. The participants perceived a direct link between their health and their patterns ofliving cut off from their preferred way of living, experiencing loss and feeling displaced and devalued. This reflects Newman’s ideas that the pattern of the whole is reflected in the part. The use of plays to reveal the pattern and facilitate pattern recognition and action steps is unique in this study. Design and Methods/Participants: Research Question: What are the interaction patterns of nursing students whowant to quit smoking but are unable to do so? Are there similarities among these patterns?When the students have an opportunity to recognize their patterns within a supportive partnership, what overall life changes occur? Hermeneutic-dialectic design15 nursing students who wanted to quit smoking. Relationship to Health as Expanding Consciousness (HEC) Starting smoking linked to difficulty with relationships and the desire forconnectedness. The evolving pattern of the whole reflectedrelationships with family and community.Recognition of their individual patterns was the focus of the study and notquitting smoking. The partnership was valued by both participantand support person.  Smoking did change as students realized new action potential.Depicting their own life pattern and listening to their tape recorded narrative was a new addition to the method.Full transcriptMore presentations by

Margaret Newman - Theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness




Margaret Newman 1933-
Theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness
The theory of health as expanding consciousness stems from Rogers' theory of unitary human beings. Rogers' assumptions regarding patterning of persons in interaction with the environment are basic to the view that consciousness is a manifestation of an evolving pattern of person-environment interaction. 
  Consciousness is defined as the informational capacity of the system (in this case, the human being); that is, the ability of the system to interact with the environment (Bentov, 1978). Consciousness includes not only the cognitive and affective awareness normally associated with consciousness, but also the interconnectedness of the entire living system, which includes physiochemical maintenance and growth processes as well as the immune system. This pattern of information, which is the consciousness of the system, is part of a larger, undivided pattern of an expanding universe.

Doody's Review Service
Reviewer: Gayle J. Acton, PhD, RNC (University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing)Description: This compilation of the works of Margaret Newman, a major nursing theorist, is intended to highlight the historical development of knowledge within the discipline of nursing as well as Newman's own personal theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness.Purpose: The purpose is to feature Newman's writings that outline the historical perspective of knowledge development within the nursing paradigm as well as the current focus of the discipline and future directions. Newman's past and current works are used to illuminate her ideas about nursing theory and health as well as research methods appropriate for knowledge development within the discipline of nursing.Audience: Although no target audience was delineated by the author, the book is most appropriate for graduate students and nurses educated at the graduate level interested in theory development and or Newman's theory.Features: The overall design of the book is pleasing. It is small in size with large print that is easy to see. The illustrations and tables are very helpful to the reader. It is clearly written and easy to understand. It contains classic as well as current references that enhance the value of the book.Assessment: This book is a valuable reference for those advanced nurses interested in theory and theory development. The book is unique in that Newman uses her historical articles and manuscripts to craft an overview of knowledge development in nursing presenting her definition of health with clinical examples that are very helpful to the reader. In addition, Newman delineates compelling issues facing the profession of nursing both today and in the years to come. This is an important reference for nurses engaged in theory development as well as those students studying theory and is appropriate for individual, bookstore, and nursing education library purchase.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Margaret Newman has the following 1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Diagnostic Radiology
    Radiologists help doctors get a closer look at what’s happening inside your body. If your primary care doctor wants to investigate your symptoms further, they may refer you to a radiologist to get an ultrasound or x-ray. Some radiologists specialize in mammography and breast imaging, which is who you see when you need a mammogram. A Radiologist can also determine if bones are broken or fractured after any kind of accident.


    Radiologists are trained to perform MRIs and CT scans, both of which are used to determine the presence of diseases or disorders and help your doctor properly diagnose you. They can detect anything from tumors, bleeding and infections to bone and muscle disorders.
