Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

We assigned ratings for the securities by comparing the credit risk inherent in the Property with the credit protection offered by the structure. The structure's credit enhancement is quantified by the maximum deterioration in property value that the securities are able to withstand under various stress scenarios without causing an increase in the expected loss for various rating levels. In assigning single borrower ratings, we also consider a range of qualitative issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.

                261The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†

Approximately $750.0 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, November 10, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned provisional ratings to eight classes 
of CMBS securities, issued by Hilton USA Trust 2016-HHV, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-HHV:




Cl. A, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. X-A*, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. X-B*, Assigned (P)Aa3 (sf)


Cl. B, Assigned (P)Aa3 (sf)


Cl. C, Assigned (P)A3 (sf)


Cl. D, Assigned (P)Baa3 (sf)


Cl. E, Assigned (P)Ba3 (sf)


Cl. F, Assigned (P)B3 (sf)




* Reflects interest-only classes




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by a single loan backed by a first 
lien commercial mortgage collateralized by one property, the Hilton 
Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort ("Hilton Hawaiian Village" 
or the "Property"). The ratings are based on the collateral 
and the structure of the transaction.




The Hilton Hawaiian Village is one of Hawaii's premier urban resort 
destinations, situated on twenty-two beachfront acres overlooking 
Waikiki Beach. The Resort features 2,860 guest rooms spread 
across five ocean towers offering views of Waikiki Beach, Diamond 
Head and Downtown Honolulu. The Property offers a host of resort-style 
amenities and services, including 20 food and beverage outlets, 
over 150,000 SF of flexible indoor and outdoor function space, 
three conference centers, five swimming pools, a saltwater 
lagoon, spa grottos, the Mandara Spa and Fitness Center, 
two chapels and over 100 retail tenants. The Property also features 
approximately 130,489 SF of leased retail and restaurant space, 
which is occupied by over 100 tenants.




Waikiki is a densely developed retail and restaurant market, and 
virtually no vacant land is available within the Waikiki district. 
All the prime beachfront locations are currently improved with large hotels. 
The Property provides excellent access to all major demand generators 
in the market.




Moody's approach to rating this transaction involved the application 
of both our Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS methodology 
and our IO Rating methodology. The rating approach for securities 
backed by a single loan compares the credit risk inherent in the underlying 
collateral with the credit protection offered by the structure. 
The structure's credit enhancement is quantified by the maximum deterioration 
in property value that the securities are able to withstand under various 
stress scenarios without causing an increase in the expected loss for 
various rating levels. In assigning single borrower ratings, 
we also consider a range of qualitative issues as well as the transaction's 
structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of commercial real estate loans is determined primarily 
by two factors: 1) the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by the DSCR, and 2) and the severity of loss in the event 
of default, which is largely driven by the LTV of the underlying 
loan.




The first mortgage balance of $1,275,000,000 
represents a Moody's LTV of 109.0%. The Moody's 
First Mortgage Actual DSCR is 2.17X and Moody's First Mortgage 
Actual Stressed DSCR is 0.98X.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Approach 
to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" published 
in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review incorporated the use of the excel-based Large 
Loan Model, which it uses for single borrower and large loan multi-borrower 
transactions. The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels 
based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from our 
Moody's loan level LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining 
proceeds include leverage, loan structure, and property type. 
These aggregated proceeds are then further adjusted for any pooling benefits 
associated with loan level diversity, other concentrations and correlations.




Moody's analysis also uses the CMBS IO calculator which references 
the following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the 
published methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit 
estimates; original and current bond balances grossed up for losses 
for all bonds the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and 
IO type corresponding to an IO type as defined in the published methodology. 





Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5.0%, 
14.3%, and 22.8%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated (P) Aaa (sf) classes would be Aaa (sf), 
Aaa (sf), and Aa2 (sf), respectively. Parameter Sensitivities 
are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate 
over time; rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation 
of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in 
the initial rating process differed. The analysis assumes that 
the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the 
ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
pay downs or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




Moody's ratings address only the credit risks associated with the 
transaction. Other non-credit risks have not been addressed 
and may have a significant effect on yield to investors.




The ratings do not represent any assessment of (i) the likelihood or frequency 
of prepayment on the mortgage loans, (ii) the allocation of net 
aggregate prepayment interest shortfalls, (iii) whether or to what 
extent prepayment premiums might be received, or (iv) in the case 
of any class of interest-only certificates, the likelihood 
that the holders thereof might not fully recover their investment in the 
event of a rapid rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1048075.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
