                                    Patents by Inventor Alex Vayser
                                




                    Alex Vayser has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







ILLUMINATED AND MODULAR SOFT TISSUE RETRACTOR



Publication number:  20170196652
                                            

Abstract:  A surgical retractor for illuminating a surgical field includes an ergonomic handle, a retractor blade coupled with the handle, a quick release mechanism, and an illuminator blade. The retractor blade is adapted to engage and retract tissue, and the quick release mechanism is adapted to couple the handle with the retractor blade. The illuminator blade acts as a waveguide to transmit light by total internal reflection. Light is extracted from the illuminator to illuminate the surgical field. The retractor blade is releasable from the handle without requiring uncoupling of the illuminator blade from the handle and also without requiring optical uncoupling of the illuminator blade from a light source. The retractor may also be adapted to evacuate smoke from the surgical field.

ILLUMINATED TELESCOPING CANNULA



Publication number:  20170100022
                                            

Abstract:  The illumination system described below comprises an arthroscope, endoscope or other suitable surgical tool and an attachable cannula comprising a transparent or semi-transparent material capable of carrying light from the proximal end of the cannula to the distal end of the cannula, thereby illuminating the surgical field. The surgical field is thus illuminated through components that do not occupy space that may otherwise be used for the optics of the arthroscope. The arthroscopic illumination system further comprises one or more illumination sources disposed at the proximal end of the cannula. The illumination source may be optically coupled with the cannula at the hub or other appropriate location. The cannula comprises a sterilizable polymer which functions as a waveguide. A waveguide is a material medium that confines and guides light. When in use, the light source connected to the hub provides light which may be guided to the distal end of the cannula or any other suitable location.

Illuminated clip and methods of use



Patent number:  9574742
                                            

Abstract:  A surgical clip for illuminating tissue in a surgical field has first and second elongate arms and a connector joining the arms together. The arms are biased to expand laterally outward into an expanded configuration in which the arms engage the tissue in the surgical field with enough force to seat the clip without retracting the tissue. A waveguide illuminator is coupled to the first arm, and has a light input portion, a light output portion, and a light conducting portion extending between the light input portion and the light output portion. Light passes through the waveguide illuminator by total internal reflection, and the waveguide illuminator directs light to the tissue. Methods of using the illuminated clip are also disclosed.

Illuminated cannula



Patent number:  9504373
                                            

Abstract:  The illumination system comprises an arthroscope, endoscope or other suitable surgical tool and an attachable cannula comprising a transparent or semi-transparent material capable of carrying light from the proximal end of the cannula to the distal end of the cannula, thereby illuminating the surgical field. The surgical field is thus illuminated through components that do not occupy space that may otherwise be used for the optics of the arthroscope. The arthroscopic illumination system further comprises one or more illumination sources disposed at the proximal end of the cannula. The illumination source may be optically coupled with the cannula at the hub or other appropriate location. The cannula comprises a sterilizable polymer which functions as a waveguide. A waveguide is a material medium that confines and guides light. When in use, the light source connected to the hub provides light which may be guided to the distal end of the cannula or any other suitable location.

Abstract:  An illumination element such as an optical waveguide for illuminating a surgical field in a patient has a light input section, a light transmitting section, and a light output section. The light input section is optically coupled to a proximal section of the light transmitting section and inputs light into the illumination element. The light transmitting section transmits the light preferably by total internal reflection or by other transmission means. The light output section is adjacent a distal section of the light transmitting section which has a light extraction area from which the light exits with an energy density. The light extraction area comprises a bore extending at least partially inward into a distal end of the light output section. A plurality of optical structures is disposed on an inner wall of the bore. The optical structures are configured to extract light from the light output section and direct the extracted light toward the surgical field.

Blade insert illuminator



Patent number:  9468366
                                            

Abstract:  An air gap retractor illumination system includes any suitable retractor such as a McCulloch with a channel in the blade to accommodate an air gap illuminator. The illuminator is preferably made from a suitable light conducting plastic material such as acrylic or polycarbonate or silicone. The illuminator has active portions in which light passes and inactive or dead zones in which light does not pass as a result of the configuration and orientation of the input, output and surfaces of the illuminator. The illuminator is formed to have an air gap surrounding any active portion of the illuminator extending from the light input to the light output portion. The dead zones may include elements to allow the illuminator to securely engage the retractor.
