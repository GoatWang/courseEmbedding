SandRidge Permian Trust Announces Quarterly Distribution






July 27, 2017 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SANDRIDGE PERMIAN TRUST (NYSE: PER) today announced a quarterly 
      distribution for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 (which 
      primarily relates to production attributable to the Trust’s interests 
      from March 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017) of $6.2 million, or $0.119 per unit. 
      The Trust makes distributions on a quarterly basis on or about the 60th 
      day following the completion of each quarter. The distribution is 
      expected to occur on or before August 25, 2017 to holders of record as 
      of the close of business on August 11, 2017.
    

      During the three-month production period ended May 31, 2017, combined 
      sales volumes were slightly lower than the previous period and oil, 
      natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) prices decreased. As no 
      additional development wells will be drilled, the Trust’s production is 
      expected to decline each quarter during the remainder of its life.
    

      The Trust owns royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in 
      the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Andrews County, Texas 
      and is entitled to receive proceeds from the sale of production 
      attributable to the royalty interests. As described in the Trust’s 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the 
      amount of the quarterly distributions is expected to fluctuate from 
      quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a 
      result of actual production volumes, oil, NGL and natural gas prices and 
      the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among 
      other factors. All Trust unitholders share distributions on a pro rata 
      basis.
    

      Volumes, price and distributable income available to unitholders for the 
      period were (dollars in thousands, except per unit):

      Pursuant to IRC Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively 
      connected to a United States trade or business allocated to foreign 
      partners should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under Section 
      1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income 
      from United States sources allocated to foreign partners should be made 
      at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. This is 
      intended to be a qualified notice by SandRidge Permian Trust to nominees 
      and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 
      1.1446-4(b), and while specific relief is not specified for Section 1441 
      income, this disclosure is intended to suffice. Nominees and brokers 
      should withhold at the highest marginal rate, currently 39.6% for 
      individuals, on the distribution made to foreign partners.
    

      This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking 
      statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, 
      other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking 
      statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking 
      statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution 
      to unit holders. The anticipated distribution is based, in part, on the 
      amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from 
      SandRidge Energy, Inc. (“SandRidge”) with respect to the relevant 
      period. Any differences in actual cash receipts by the Trust could 
      affect this distributable amount. The amount of such cash received or 
      expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay 
      distributions) has been and will be significantly and negatively 
      impacted by prevailing low commodity prices, which could remain low for 
      an extended period of time or decline further. Other important factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of 
      the Trust and reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made 
      in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in 
      this press release. Neither SandRidge nor the Trustee intends, and 
      neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included 
      in this press release. An investment in Common Units issued by SandRidge 
      Permian Trust is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all of its 
      other filings with the SEC. The Trust’s quarterly and other filed 
      reports are or will be available over the Internet at the SEC’s web site 
      at http://www.sec.gov.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
SandRidge was founded in 2006 by Tom L. Ward by buying approximately 50% of Riata Energy of Amarillo, Texas. Ward previously co-founded Chesapeake Energy with Aubrey McClendon and was the chief operating officer of that company from 1989 until 1996.[2]
The company went public via an initial public offering on November 5, 2007, selling over 28 million common shares.[3]
On June 19, 2013, after a series of missteps, CEO Tom L. Ward was ousted by the board of the directors and James Bennett became President and CEO.[4] Bennett first joined the company in 2010 and previously worked at GSO Capital Partners.[5]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in the Gulf of Mexico for $750 million.[6]
In 2015, the company acquired Pinon Gathering Company, owner of 370 miles of gathering lines, which reduced Sandridge's lease operating and gathering expense.[7] It also acquired 136,000 net acres in the Niobara shale formation for $190 million in cash.[8] By then, the local fracking boom had largely played out and the economies of Harper, Sumner and adjacent southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma counties suffered under the impact.[9] Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity produced by injected wastes, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, thanks to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in injection well volumes and pressures. SandRidge, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Southcentral Kansas, appealed the order, but soon went into bankruptcy.[10][11]
In 2016, the company went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[12]
Operations[edit]
In the third quarter of 2016, the company produced 49.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (303,000 GJ) per day.[1]
SandRidge owns oil properties in the Mid-Continent, which accounts for 93% of production. It also owns properties in the Permian Basin, West Texas and in the Niobrara Formation of Colorado.[1]
The company has formed 3 public royalty trusts:

Sandridge Permian Trust (NYSE: PER) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Andrews County, Texas.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE: SDT) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Garfield, Grant and Woods counties in Oklahoma.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust II (NYSE: SDR) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Grant, Kay, Noble and Woods counties in northern Oklahoma and Barber, Comanche, Harper and Sumner counties in southern Kansas.

History[edit]
SandRidge was founded in 2006 by Tom L. Ward by buying approximately 50% of Riata Energy of Amarillo, Texas. Ward previously co-founded Chesapeake Energy with Aubrey McClendon and was the chief operating officer of that company from 1989 until 1996.[2]
The company went public via an initial public offering on November 5, 2007, selling over 28 million common shares.[3]
On June 19, 2013, after a series of missteps, CEO Tom L. Ward was ousted by the board of the directors and James Bennett became President and CEO.[4] Bennett first joined the company in 2010 and previously worked at GSO Capital Partners.[5]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in the Gulf of Mexico for $750 million.[6]
In 2015, the company acquired Pinon Gathering Company, owner of 370 miles of gathering lines, which reduced Sandridge's lease operating and gathering expense.[7] It also acquired 136,000 net acres in the Niobara shale formation for $190 million in cash.[8] By then, the local fracking boom had largely played out and the economies of Harper, Sumner and adjacent southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma counties suffered under the impact.[9] Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity produced by injected wastes, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, thanks to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in injection well volumes and pressures. SandRidge, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Southcentral Kansas, appealed the order, but soon went into bankruptcy.[10][11]
In 2016, the company went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[12]
Operations[edit]
In the third quarter of 2016, the company produced 49.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (303,000 GJ) per day.[1]
SandRidge owns oil properties in the Mid-Continent, which accounts for 93% of production. It also owns properties in the Permian Basin, West Texas and in the Niobrara Formation of Colorado.[1]
The company has formed 3 public royalty trusts:

Sandridge Permian Trust (NYSE: PER) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Andrews County, Texas.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE: SDT) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Garfield, Grant and Woods counties in Oklahoma.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust II (NYSE: SDR) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Grant, Kay, Noble and Woods counties in northern Oklahoma and Barber, Comanche, Harper and Sumner counties in southern Kansas.

Is Sandridge Permian Trust Worth a Long-Term Investment?
With 16 years left before the Sandridge Permian Trust closes up shop, will the trust return enough in distributions to make it a worth while investment?

Editorial Note: This article was updated on May 5th, 2015 from the original article published on June 30th, 2014.
Sandridge Permian Trust's (NYSE: PER) spectacular distribution yield of almost 51% is enough to make just about every income investor say, "this is too good to be true." In the case of royalty trusts, that can very much be the case. Now that Sandridge Energy (NYSE: SD) has drilled its last well as part of the covenants with the Permain trust, the Sandridge Permian Trust will go into a state of perpetual decline until Sandridge dissolves the trust in 2031. So, the question for long-term investors is if they can make a decent return on the trust through its distributions before the party is over. To better understand this, let's run through a series of scenarios that will help give a clearer picture of what to expect from this Trust over the long term.
If you are looking at a royalty trust for the first time and are not quite sure what they are and how they operate, check out this quick primer. 
It's not a stock, so change your mind-setA big trap for investors is to think that a royalty trust is a stock. It's not. Over the long term, share prices in a royalty trust should perpetually be in decline as the reserve base for that royalty trust is diminished. The only way a share price can go up is if the value of that commodity goes up faster than the reserve declines. So, when making an investment in an royalty trust, you should base your decision solely on whether the distributions that the trust will exceed the price you pay for a share. 





The Sandridge Permian Trust is quite possibly the most direct way an individual investor can make an investment on oil in the Permian Basin. Unlike the other trusts that have been issued by Sandridge Energy, the Permian trust is predominately an oil trust. Its current production is more than 85% oil, compared to the Sandridge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE: SDT) and Sandridge Mississippian Trust II (NYSE: SDR), which produce about 36% and 45% oil, respectively. 
So, in this specific case, we are making the bet that oil from the wells in this particular part of the Permian basin will generate a return over the life of the wells greater than our original investment, and hopefully that return will be superior to other investment opportunities. 
Breaking down the return scenariosIn reality, we can't predict the long-term return of a royalty trust because, frankly, we have no way of knowing what the price of oil will be in the future. Instead, we can look at the physical characteristics of the wells and how that will impact the distribution over time. Today, Sandridge estimates that the Permian Trust has about 11.8 million barrels of oil equivalent that can be extracted based on today's oil prices. Based on the most recent production numbers, the trust has a reserve to production ratio of a little more than 7.8 years. For the trust to last until its terminal date in 2031, though, that would mean today's production would need to decline 10.3% on average to make the reserve last the entire duration of the trust.
Using this decline estimate and the current annual distribution, we can project a rough estimate of the trust's longtime return. Let's assume the trust's distribution declines at the same rate as production and that when the trust is liquidated at the end of its life, you get 10% of the current value of the trust. Using this assumption, the estimated return over the life of the trust would look something like this:






Source: 10-K via sec.gov, author's calculations.
So, based on those assumptions, and were the price oil to remain constant throughout the life of the trust, then you could potentially generate a greater than 200% your money over this 16 year period. Of course, there are likely to be some changes on oil prices over this time, so here's what those returns would look like if oil prices were to swing 25% in either direction. 



Scenario
Estimated Return Over Life of Trust (16 years)
Compounded Annual Growth Rate


Oil prices remain constant
232%
7.7%


Oil prices increase 25%
313%
9.27%


Oil prices decrease 25%
152%
5.94%



Authors note: These projections assume that distributions from the trust are not reinvested back into the trust
Based on these projections, an optimistic return on the trust would be an annualized compounded return of 9.27%, which assumes that oil prices over the life of the life of the trust will be 25% higher than what they are today. That isn't too much of a stretch considering where oil prices are today. Since 1871, when records were first kept, the S&P 500 has an inflation-adjusted compounded annual growth rate of 6.86%, so investing directly in the Permain Trust has the potential to do much better. 





The one thing that you need to consider, though, is that half of the royalty revenue over the past 6 months has come from settlements of futures contracts that have allowed the Trust to realize higher than market prices on its oil. As these hedging contracts expire, the Trust will be more exposed to the market price of crude oil today and will likely result in much lower distributions. 
What a Fool believesIf you were to invest in the Sandridge Permian Trust and hold it until its liquidation, it's very likely you won't lose money. So, if you are looking to protect your principal over a 15-year period, then perhaps the Sandridge Permian trust is a place to invest since it will likely beat inflation. In fact, at toady's low share price, there is a pretty good chance that the Trust's distribution returns could be greater than the S&P 500. The one concern is that the expiration of those derivative contracts will significantly decrease the Trust's distributions over the next couple of quarters.
At the same time, its future is completely reliant on where oil prices go from here. If history has taught us anything, it's that there is no real way for us to know this. Investors who want to play it safe shouldn't count on oil prices to rise any time soon. Based on this, there are probably better opportunities out there.

The Trust makes distributions on a quarterly basis on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. The distribution is expected to occur on or before February 24, 2017 to holders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2017.During the three-month production period ended November 30, 2016, total sales volumes were slightly lower than the previous period; however, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) prices increased. As no additional development wells will be drilled, the Trust’s production is expected to decline each quarter during the remainder of its life.The Trust owns royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Andrews County, Texas and is entitled to receive proceeds from the sale of production attributable to the royalty interests. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the amount of the quarterly distributions is expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. All Trust unitholders share distributions on a pro rata basis.Volumes, price and distributable income available to unitholders for the period were (dollars in thousands, except per unit):  Sales Volumes               Oil (MBbl)         156     NGL (MBbl)         22     Natural Gas (MMcf)         75     Combined (MBoe)         190     Average Price           Oil (per Bbl)       $   42.93     NGL (per Bbl)       $   17.53     Natural Gas (per Mcf)       $   2.21     Natural Gas (per Mcf) including impact of post-production expenses       $   2.00     Revenues       $   7,235     Expenses           912     Distributable income available to unitholders       $   6,323     Distributable income per unit (52,500,000 units issued and outstanding)       $   0.120                Pursuant to IRC Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively connected to a United States trade or business allocated to foreign partners should be made at the highest marginal rate.
