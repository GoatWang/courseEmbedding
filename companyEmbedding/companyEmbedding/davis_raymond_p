Davis, Raymond P. - The Wall Street Transcript













































 





































Raymond P. Davis
RAYMOND P. DAVIS, President and Chief Executive Officer of Umpqua
Holdings Corporation, is at the forefront of change in the
financial industry. He is leading the charge with unique delivery
systems and pushing the Oregon-based financial services company
into uncharted waters by using e-commerce strategies and adding a
successful brokerage subsidiary to its mix of offerings. Umpqua
Holdings Corporation is the parent company of Umpqua Bank and the
full-service brokerage firm Strand, Atkinson, Williams &York.
Prior to the November 2000 merger of South Umpqua Bank and Valley
of the Rogue Bank, Mr. Davis was the President and CEO of South
Umpqua Bank. He has since overseen the acquisitions of
Independent Financial Network, Linn-Benton Bank and Centennial
Bancorp, creating the largest Oregon-based bank at $2.6 billion
in assets and 68 banking locations. Mr. Davis joined South Umpqua
Bank in 1994 and launched an aggressive expansion together with a
cutting-edge retail-banking strategy. He has brought Umpqua Bank
from third to first in its home market, added several new
locations in markets throughout Oregon, taken the bank public on
the NASDAQ exchange, and created a financial services holding
company, which acquired Oregon’s second-largest full-service
investment firm, Strand, Atkinson, Williams & York. Under his
leadership, the assets of Umpqua Bank grew 10-fold between 1994
and 2001. Before joining Umpqua Bank, Mr. Davis served as
President of the U.S. Banking Alliance, headquartered in Atlanta.

                  REVIEW QUOTES
            

"Ray and his colleagues have remained true to their values, their belief system, their distinctive point of view about what their company could be and the role it could play in their customers' lives. In a book filled with powerful insights, pragmatic takeaways, and colorful stories, this to me is Ray's ultimate lesson, and one that applies in good times and tough times." --From the Foreword by William C. Taylor "I've always believed that great leaders know when to stay the course, adjust, and reinvent. Ray Davis articulates this and much more in "Leading Through Uncertainty," helping leaders understand the importance of outlining a vision and strategy. Ray's smart and practical thoughts on leadership provide great insight, and leaders at all levels will benefit from reading this book." --John Chambers, chairman and CEO, Cisco "Ray Davis understands the complexities of leading effectively regardless of the economic environment. The advice in "Leading Through Uncertainty" is excellent and will improve both your leadership skills and results." -- Tim Boyle, president and CEO, Columbia Sportswear "Ray Davis's "Leading Through Uncertainty" is thoughtful, insightful, and--perhaps most importantly--fundamentally practical. For those who want to make a difference in their organization, this is a must-read." --Diana Oreck, vice president, Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center "Not many companies can say they've emerged from the economic environment of the past few years stronger than they were before it began. Ray Davis can. In "Leading Through Uncertainty," he shares the real-world insight and business practices that today's leaders need to navigate the uncertainty and opportunity of the 21st century economy." --Gary Hamel, author, "What Matters Now" "Ray Davis is that rare combination: a visionary with the straightforward voice of a pragmatist. He understands that today's companies must be flexible, transparent, and customer-centric--and "Leading Through Uncertainty" provides a clear roadmap for anyone in a leadership position on how to get there." --Ed Herlihy, partner, Wachtell Lipton

Reviews
“Ray and his colleagues have remained true to their
values, their belief system, their distinctive point of view about
what their company could be and the role it could play in their
customers’ lives. In a book filled with powerful insights,
pragmatic takeaways, and colorful stories, this to me is
Ray’s ultimate lesson, and one that applies in good times and
tough times.”
—From the Foreword by William C. Taylor
“I’ve always believed that great leaders know when
to stay the course, adjust, and reinvent. Ray Davis articulates
this and much more in Leading Through Uncertainty, helping
leaders understand the importance of outlining a vision and
strategy. Ray’s smart and practical thoughts on leadership
provide great insight, and leaders at all levels will benefit from
reading this book.”
—John Chambers, chairman and CEO, Cisco
“Ray Davis understands the complexities of leading
effectively regardless of the economic environment. The advice in
Leading Through Uncertainty is excellent and will improve
both your leadership skills and results.”
— Tim Boyle, president and CEO, Columbia
Sportswear
“Ray Davis’s Leading Through Uncertainty is
thoughtful, insightful, and—perhaps most
importantly—fundamentally practical. For those who want to
make a difference in their organization, this is a
must-read.”
—Diana Oreck, vice president, Ritz-Carlton
Leadership Center
“Not many companies can say they’ve emerged from the
economic environment of the past few years stronger than they were
before it began. Ray Davis can. In Leading Through
Uncertainty, he shares the real-world insight and business
practices that today’s leaders need to navigate the
uncertainty and opportunity of the 21st century
economy.”
—Gary Hamel, author, What Matters Now
“Ray Davis is that rare combination: a visionary with the
straightforward voice of a pragmatist. He understands that
today’s companies must be flexible, transparent, and
customer-centric—and Leading Through Uncertainty
provides a clear roadmap for anyone in a leadership position on how
to get there.”
—Ed Herlihy, partner, Wachtell Lipton

"Ray Davis's Leading Through Uncertainty is thoughtful, insightful, and—perhaps most importantly—fundamentally practical. For those who want to make a difference in their organization, this is a must-read." —Diana Oreck, vice president, Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center
"I’ve always believed that great leaders know when to stay the course, adjust, and reinvent. Ray Davis articulates this and much more in his playbook for leadership and successfully navigating through uncertainty. He talks about leaders at all levels and understanding the importance of outlining a vision and strategy as well as identifying and catching what I call ‘market transitions.'  Ray’s smart and practical thoughts on leadership provide great insight and leaders would benefit from reading this book.”
—John Chambers, chairman and CEO, Cisco:
It's no secret that the Great Recession has deeply affected many businesses and industries, including banking. Yet the West Coast's largest independent community bank, Umpqua Bank, didn’t just survive this economic storm – it emerged even stronger than it was before.
In Leading Through Uncertainty: How Umpqua Bank Emerged from the Great Recession Better and Stronger than Ever (Jossey-Bass; 978-1-11873302-8; November 2013; e-book available), Umpqua CEO Ray Davis shares the leadership best practices that guide the organization and have led to its success in both good times and challenging times, including its focus on honesty, motivating and inspiring employees, building an outstanding corporate reputation, creating buzz with non-traditional marketing, paying attention to details, and ultimately, growing where others haven’t. 
In this follow-up to his earlier book, Leading for Growth, Davis discusses how Umpqua has differentiated itself from others and grown at a time when so many have faltered.
Umpqua’s strategy delivers the products and sophistication of a large institution with a customer-centric approach that defies industry norms. Even as the aftershocks of the financial crisis continue to drive some banks to the brink of collapse, Umpqua continues to pioneer a new approach.
 And the strategy works: Umpqua has grown to more than 2500 associates and more than 200 bank stores across four states. Leading Through Uncertainty draws on Umpqua’s success to offersmart, concise tips and insight that will help leaders in any industry secure a lasting foothold in this, or any, economy.
