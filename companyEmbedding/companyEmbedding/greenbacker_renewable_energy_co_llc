This offering of securities to which this website relates is currently not available to residents of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Ohio.

            1) Offering price subject to change. Reliance should only be made on the offering price as stated in the current prospectus, as amended and supplemented. 
2) The amount of distributions that will be paid, if any, is uncertain. There is no guarantee the distributions will continue to be paid. We have paid regular monthly distributions to our shareholders since September 2014. We expect to continue paying distributions monthly unless our results of operations, our general financial conditions, general economic conditions or other factors make it imprudent to do so. The timing and amount of distributions will be determined by our board of directors, in its discretion, and may vary from time to time. We have paid and may continue to pay, without limitation, distributions from any source, including, but not limited to borrowings and offering proceeds; provided, however that no funds will be advanced or borrowed for purpose of distributions, if the amount of such distributions would exceed our accrued and received revenues for the previous four quarters, less paid and accrued operating costs with respect to such revenues. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for investment and your overall return will be reduced. From 09/01/14 through 12/31/14, 100% of distributions were paid from capital contributions by the company’s sponsor. Since 01/01/15, distributions have been paid from net investment income as well as offering proceeds. The distribution rates shown became effective 09/01/14. During the period from 09/01/14 through 3/31/15, the distribution rate was 6.53%, 6.27% and 6.00% for Class I, C, and A shares, respectively. For Class C shares, we currently pay distribution fees that accrue daily equal to 1/365th of 0.80% from year to year. The payment of distribution fees will result in a lower amount of distributions being paid to shareholders of Class C shares.

Renewable Energy |  Greenbacker

























 





















 


 




			
Renewable Energy power plants and smaller systems using solar, wind, biomass and other renewable forms of energy represent a growing portion of global energy production. As technology advances, the costs of installing these energy systems have become much more economical leading to a dramatic increase in power generation from these clean and efficient sources.			
		


Projects designed to lower energy usage are very important in a world in which the cost of energy continues to increase. Many new opportunities exist for enhancing energy efficiency including the replacement of conventional lighting with LED Lighting; the installation of heat saving insulation and enhanced windows; combined heat and power systems that utilize energy in a more efficient way just to name a few.			
		

			
Sustainability projects are designed to utilize fewer resources to do the same task or to use waste or recycled materials to achieve economic goals. In a world in which many basic resources are becoming scarcer, sustainability projects are increasingly being undertaken by businesses in order to meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations.

NEW YORK, Sept. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire/ — Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company LLC (“Greenbacker”) announced today that through a wholly-owned subsidiary it signed a definitive agreement on August 28, 2014 to acquire a $880,000 solar portfolio with assets in Boulder, Broomfield, Denver and surrounding areas in Colorado.  The Sunny Mountain Portfolio (“Portfolio”) consists of rooftop and ground mount solar systems located on municipal, commercial and residential properties. Electricity produced by the Portfolio is sold under long term Power Purchase Agreements.  Over 80% of the Portfolio’s revenue is anticipated to come from investment grade counterparties.  In total, the systems are expected to produce approximately 1,090 thousand Kilowatt hours of power in 2015; enough electricity to power approximately 141 homes for one year of typical use.
“With the cost of solar power declining, the industry is experiencing remarkable growth as communities and businesses throughout America seek to reduce their use of fossil fuels in favor of clean, affordable, renewable energy,” stated Charles Wheeler, CEO of Greenbacker.  “We are excited to add these high-quality assets to our portfolio and their long term contractual power purchase agreements help provide stability and predictability of future cash flows.”
About Greenbacker 
Greenbacker is a publicly registered, non-traded limited liability company that expects to acquire a diversified portfolio of income-producing renewable energy power plants, energy efficiency projects and other sustainable investments.

 WHAT IS RENEWABLE ENERGY?


Renewable energy, often referred to as clean energy, is energy that comes from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind, moving water, and geothermal heat. Using established technologies, renewable energy power plants convert the energy of these natural resources into electricity that can be sold to creditworthy entities, such as businesses, utilities and governments, via long-term contractual agreements. Renewable energy power plants can help provide cheap and clean electricity to help power American business, create jobs, and move the United States toward energy independence. As an asset class, renewable energy has historically attracted significant investment from large corporations and sophisticated institutional investors seeking diversification1 and consistent returns. With the introduction of Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company ("Greenbacker"), individual investors can now invest in renewable energy power plants through a professionally managed fund.
