History[edit]




Royal Caribbean headquarters.


Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was formed in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, founded in 1968, and Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988, was then purchased. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.[6]
A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with British First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets.[7]
In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded radically with the creation of new cruise lines: Azamara Club Cruises was created in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises[8] and CDF Croisières de France, aimed at French-language customers, in May 2008.[9] Another new cruise line, TUI Cruises began operations in 2009. The brand is aimed at a German-speaking audience and is a joint venture with TUI AG.[10]
TUI Travel had previously become the owner of 50% of Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007.[11] In October 2008 Royal Caribbean Cruises sold their share of Island Cruises to TUI.[5]

History[edit]




Royal Caribbean headquarters.


Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was formed in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, founded in 1968, and Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988, was then purchased. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.[6]
A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with British First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets.[7]
In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded radically with the creation of new cruise lines: Azamara Club Cruises was created in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises[8] and CDF Croisières de France, aimed at French-language customers, in May 2008.[9] Another new cruise line, TUI Cruises began operations in 2009. The brand is aimed at a German-speaking audience and is a joint venture with TUI AG.[10]
TUI Travel had previously become the owner of 50% of Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007.[11] In October 2008 Royal Caribbean Cruises sold their share of Island Cruises to TUI.[5]

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is an American global cruise company incorporated in Liberia and based in Miami, Florida. It is the world's second-largest cruise line operator, after Carnival Corporation & plc. As of March 2009, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. fully owns three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara Club Cruises. They also hold a 50% stake in TUI Cruises and 49% stakes in Pullmantur Cruises and CDF Croisières de France.[3][4] Previously Royal Caribbean Cruises also owned 50% of Island Cruises, but this was sold to TUI Travel PLC in October 2008.[5]

History[edit]




Royal Caribbean headquarters.


Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was formed in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, founded in 1968, and Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988, was then purchased. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.[6]
A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with British First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets.[7]
In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded radically with the creation of new cruise lines: Azamara Club Cruises was created in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises[8] and CDF Croisières de France, aimed at French-language customers, in May 2008.[9] Another new cruise line, TUI Cruises began operations in 2009. The brand is aimed at a German-speaking audience and is a joint venture with TUI AG.[10]
TUI Travel had previously become the owner of 50% of Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007.[11] In October 2008 Royal Caribbean Cruises sold their share of Island Cruises to TUI.[5]

History[edit]




Royal Caribbean headquarters.


Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was formed in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, founded in 1968, and Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988, was then purchased. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.[6]
A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with British First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets.[7]
In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded radically with the creation of new cruise lines: Azamara Club Cruises was created in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises[8] and CDF Croisières de France, aimed at French-language customers, in May 2008.[9] Another new cruise line, TUI Cruises began operations in 2009. The brand is aimed at a German-speaking audience and is a joint venture with TUI AG.[10]
TUI Travel had previously become the owner of 50% of Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007.[11] In October 2008 Royal Caribbean Cruises sold their share of Island Cruises to TUI.[5]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




Royal Caribbean headquarters.


Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was formed in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, founded in 1968, and Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988, was then purchased. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.[6]
A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with British First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets.[7]
In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded radically with the creation of new cruise lines: Azamara Club Cruises was created in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises[8] and CDF Croisières de France, aimed at French-language customers, in May 2008.[9] Another new cruise line, TUI Cruises began operations in 2009. The brand is aimed at a German-speaking audience and is a joint venture with TUI AG.[10]
TUI Travel had previously become the owner of 50% of Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007.[11] In October 2008 Royal Caribbean Cruises sold their share of Island Cruises to TUI.[5]

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Airfarewatchdog.com

www.airfarewatchdog.com
It's far from the prettiest site on our list of faves, but airfarewatchdog.com provides lots of cheap deals, and insider tips on how to find more. It's also one of the few travel sites that let you search by departure city, for when you just want to get out of town for a few days and don't really care where you end up, as long as the airfare is cheap.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: BookingBuddy

www.bookingbuddy.com
BookingBuddy takes some (not all) of the hassle out of searching the various travel sites for the best fare. Enter your travel details, and BookingBuddy will point you to the different travel sites to find the best deal. I wish it would search them for me and gather the results instead of just redirecting me to them, but at least BookingBuddy saves you from having to enter your travel info nine times on nine different sites.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Farecast

www.farecast.com
Airline tickets are like stocks: the prices fluctuate all the time, seemingly for no reason at all, making it hard to know when to buy. Farecast helps you know what your odds are of getting a good deal. The site is a fare aggregator similar to Kayak, but it includes useful fare predictions (as opposed to Kayak's fare history, which Farecast also has) that guess at what the price fluctuations ought to be in the coming days and weeks. It even rates tickets as "Buy" or "Wait" and tells you how volatile the ticket price is.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Hotwire

www.hotwire.com
In our price testing for this story, Hotwire had the best price for next-weekend flights. Travel partners offer Hotwire unsold inventory (plane seats, etc) at deeply discounted prices, which Hotwire then passes on to users. The only problem is that the service doesn't always tell you which airline you'll be flying or your exact flying time, so if you're choosy about your flights, Hotwire may not be for you.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: InsideTrip

www.insidetrip.com
InsideTrip adds user ratings to the familiar aggregated ticket search formula. Users rate the comfort, speed, and "ease" of flights, and those ratings are added to InsideTrip's search results. Also, you can set priorities using the TripQuality Dashboard; is legroom more important to you than a good on-time percentage? Do you prefer non-stop flights? Newer planes? Customize your results and find the perfect match.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Kayak

www.kayak.com
Kayak and SideStep are the big names in aggregated ticket searching, and are owned by the same company as of December 2007. The sites comb through ticket prices from all the major airlines and sites like CheapTickets.com to find you the best prices. Kayak is a bit more no-nonsense than the other sites we looked at; you'll find lots of useful data, but not a lot of the Web-2.0 extras that SideStep and others have.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Mobissimo

www.mobissimo.com
Mobissimo does the same kind of fare aggregation as Kayak and Farecast, but it puts a "fun" Web-2.0 skin on it. The site doesn't have all the robust features of Kayak and Farecast, but it does have an AJAX UI that lets you move modules around, a scattershot travel blog, and Flickr, weather, and currency-converter widgets.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: SeatGuru

www.seatguru.com
Before selecting your seat on the plane, be sure to visit SeatGuru.com so you know you're picking the best one. The site has seating plans for all the major airlines and plane types, and let you know which seats have the most legroom, nearby power outlets, or seatbacks that don't recline.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: SideStep

www.sidestep.com
SideStep combs the same data and uses the same basic UI as Kayak, but the user experience can be quite different. It's ticket search results will be the same as Kayak's, but SideStep incorporates more content like travel guides and newsletters, and SideStep has a downloadable toolbar that offers side-by-side ticket-price comparisons with travel sites like Expedia. A rep for Kayak and SideStep told me that Kayak is the Google of ticket search, while SideStep is the Yahoo!, and users tend to prefer one over the other.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Yapta

www.yapta.com
Yapta's downloadable plug-in tracks the prices of flights you're interested in, letting you know the best time to pull the trigger. But even if you don't want to download anything, the service can still save you money. Once you've bought your ticket, enter in your flight number, travel dates, and ticket price. If the price drops below what you paid for your ticket, Yapta will let you know via e-mail so can get a voucher for the price difference from the airline. I've done it myself and it's worked every time.Also, starting next month, Yapta will help you find flights instead of just tracking prices for you. The new Flight Finder feature will let you specify your flight preferences and track down flights that meet them.

10 Sites for Cheaper Flights: Bonus: Virgin Air Charter

www.virgincharter.com
Want to fly in style? Virgin Air offers a charter plane service that you can book online. Choose from several different plane sizes (twin-prop through airliner) and be prepared to pay for the luxury of having a plane all to you. I found a twin-prop flight from Dallas to Chicago for $6,000, but prices go way up from there.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
