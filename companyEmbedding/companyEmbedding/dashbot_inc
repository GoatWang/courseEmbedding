dashbot
... is yet another live dashboard solution to monitor your software- or
product development process. Use it for dashboards served by a i.e.
Rasperry PI or as an intranet website.

A live demo can be found on heroku (The project files can be found here:  github.com/hennr/dashbotdemo)
Build it
$ npm install
$ grunt
Run it locally
Follow Build it and then run any of these commands:
# via nginxere; available at https://github.com/sbstnmsch/nginxere
$ nginxere 
# via python
$ cd dist && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
# or by serving ./dist with your favorite web server
Now point your browser to http://localhost:8000
Serve it
To serve the dashboard with nginx or another web server edit the layout.json to
serve your needs and point your web server's root to dist/.
Notes on CORS
For polling other than local URLs (like in the example) start up your browser
with disabled security, i.e. Chrome with:
$ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security
Lay it out
Dashbot's tiles are called visuals. These visuals are designed to fill your
screen. Just edit your layout.json:
[
  [
    { /* Visual A: Row 1, Col 1 - Full width */ }
  ],
  [
    { /* Visual B: Row 2, Col 1 - 50% width */ },
    { /* Visual C: Row 2, Col 2 - 50% width */ }
  ],
  [
    { /* Visual D: Row 3, Col 1 - ~33% width */ },
    { /* Visual E: Row 3, Col 2 - ~33% width */ },
    { /* Visual F: Row 3, Col 3 - ~33% width */ }
  ]
]
Visuals
Choose from a growing set of visuals to serve your needs.
Number Visual Examples
The simplest way to display a number visual with a static value and title:
{
  "visual": "number",
  "title": "Ali Baba and the...",
  "value": 40
}
Make it poll external sources every 60secs:
{
  "visual": "number",
  "title": "Ali Baba and the...",
  "xhr": "/some/url/ali/baba.json",
  "xhrValue": "thieves.count",
  "xhrInterval": 60
}
... whereas the baba.json file has following dynamic content:
{
    "name": "Ali Baba",
    "thieves": {
      "count": 40,
      ...
    }
}
As you can see the value is evaluated against whatever you tell xhrValue
to be. So there is no need to change your existing JSON-files.
If you want you can define a red/ green state:
{
  ...
  "red": "!=40",
  "green": "==40"
}
Display units
To display your values in a special unit just define unit:
{
  ...
  "unit": "percent"
}
or ...
{
  ...
  "unit": "bytes"
}
The bytes unit automatically calculates bytes, kilobytes and megabytes.
Graph Visual
The graph visual displays more than one value in a graph:
{
  "visual": "graph",
  "title": "Application Downloads",
  "value": [2302, 2658, 1987, 2001, 2160, 2852]
}
Enjoy polling external resources by adding xhr and xhrInterval
parameters.
Weather Visual
Just for fun - getting the temperature in your city.
Kindly provided by http://openweathermap.org
{
  "visual": "weather",
  "city": "berlin,de", /* name of your city or lat, lng */
  "unit": "c" /* `c` for celsius, or `f` for fahrenheit */
}
Getting data to it
There are two way to get your data displayed by dashbot.
Write json files to your disk
When serving the ./dist folder (as described in Serve it) you can find dummy json files in the ./dist/data folder which you can update/rewrite periodically e.g. by a cronjob.
Use an external server
Alternatively you can use an external server which serves json and let that server do the updates for you.
This could look like this:
{ "visual": "number", "xhr": "https://api.github.com/users/hennr", "xhrValue": "id"}
Background images
All background images are downloaded from Wikimedia Commons and can be used in
every single visual by defining "class": "<imageid>".

imageid: comets
imageid: milkyway
imageid: night-sky
imageid: skyline
imageid: waterfall
imageid: flower
imageid: desert
imageid: storm
