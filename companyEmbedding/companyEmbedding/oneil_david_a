Framing Info







British photographer, Terry O’Neill, has photographed presidents, prime ministers, rock stars, Oscar winners and the British Royal Family. He chronicled the lives of emerging rock stars and icons of the 60s, including David Bowie, Elton John, The Who, Eric Clapton and Chuck Berry. He photographed The Beatles and The Rolling Stones when they were struggling young bands, and worked closely with Frank Sinatra for over 30 years. His photograph of Faye Dunaway, in Beverly Hills, the morning after she won her Best Actress Oscar for Network, has been nominated as the most iconic Hollywood shot of all time. O’Neill has produced covers for Time, Newsweek, Stern, Paris Match, The Sunday Times Magazine and Vanity Fair, and his work is featured in national galleries and private collections worldwide.

This portrait of David Bowie was part of a studio session in Los Angeles to promote the “Diamond Dogs” album. Bowie picked up the scissors absent-mindedly and O’Neill decided to keep them in the shoot to symbolize the cutting edge nature of Bowie’s music.

Casino Royale was as much fun off set as on. From Sammy Davis Junior turning up to visit his pal David Niven to Sellers goofing around.

Our Logo
THE CELTIC KNOT in our logo symbolizes our commitment to an interwoven relationship among client, architect, builder and subcontractors. It is our firm belief that this close relationship is necessary for a successful project.








I just wanted to thank you and your whole team for everything you’ve done to allow us to live in our amazing house… It’s really been a wonderful blessing for our family and you and your team were a huge part of making it happen. Anyway, I suspect what you guys do is rewarding for many reasons, but I thought it might be nice to hear that among them is that it creates wonderful places for people to raise and be with their families. Thanks again.
C.B., Homeowner



I have worked with O’Neill Development for over twenty years. They have consistently proven their commitment to providing the highest quality product time after time. To me, O’Neill represents the very best that our industry has to offer.
R.R.Colleague



Over the past 25 years my firm has worked with O’Neill Development on more than 20 projects ranging from modest renovations to projects of considerable scope, sophistication and complexity. They have brought a dependable team of high quality craftspeople and subcontractors to each of our projects. They stand behind their work and have been fair and accommodating in their dealings with our clients. I look forward to working with them in the years ahead.
David Neumann, FAIA Colleague



I have worked with O’Neill Development for over twenty years on both new homes and renovations. By every standard – quality of workmanship, timely completion of work, and service after completion – they are at the top of the list. Because of that and because of the quality of of their job superintendents and subcontractors, they have become our go-to partner in all of our high performance and Passive House projects.
David PeabodyPeabody Architects



Everyone from O’Neill Development involved with our residential addition project was professional and personable. They were responsive to the client’s needs, organized, met the schedule deadlines and provided the highest level of craftsmanship.
W. G.Colleague



The O’Neills are not just builders, they are artists and it shows on every one of their jobs. The architecture is carefully chosen and they have a team of old school, carpenters, project managers, and other technicians that run things the way a job should be run, ie confidently, competently, and thoroughly. Brendan brings his artistic eye to each plan and “boring” has no place in the finished product. We have been doing independent quality control services for O’Neill for about 10 years or more. We look at every component including HVAC, Electric, plumbing, structure, exterior finishes, and final finishes If there is one distinguishing characteristic of their work it is that we find the latest technical innovations combined with the best of the old construction techniques, that is a rare combination these days.
J.C.W.Colleague



Thank you for all your work on our house!
Daniel and Lia Royle



My company has worked for O’Neill Development on projects ranging in scope from small additions, to multimillion dollar homes. In every case they have provided impressive customer service to their clients, and provide some of the highest quality work in the area. We work with a large number of area General Contractors, and our experience has been that nobody does it better, or is more honest with their clients than they are.
S.N.Colleague



We’ve so dearly enjoyed living here over the years, Brendan. Joan just loves this house so much. We have wonderful, happy memories from living here – kids, dogs, friends, family, the stuff that counts.
Rick Bernthal



We still love our house (after 12 yrs) as much as or more than when we moved in. Thanks!
Ned WilliamsPresident Mater Dei School

ABOUT THE PVA, DAVID O'NEILL

Prior to his appointment, David's entire career was in the Thoroughbred horse racing industry, most of which was spent managing data for The Jockey Club and Equibase Company - racing's official database for racing information.
David serves on LFUCG’s Vacant Property Review Commission and the Infill and Redevelopment Committee and is actively engaged in pressing issues facing the community including growth, economic development and gentrification and other housing related topics.
