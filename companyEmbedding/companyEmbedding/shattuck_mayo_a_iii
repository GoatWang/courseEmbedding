Early life and education[edit]
Shattuck was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1954. He attended the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts.[5] Shattuck's father was "heavily involved in the Boston investment community," and he managed Harvard's endowment and also served as a managing director at one of Boston's most respected institutional money managers. Shattuck's father passed away in 1974.[5]
Shattuck received a Bachelor of Arts from Williams College in 1976 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1980. Shattuck graduated as an Arjay Miller Scholar.[6][7][8]
Career[edit]
Not much is known about Shattuck's career before joining Alex. Brown & Sons at its San Francisco office, where he played a role in arranging funding for various high-tech clients and public offerings for companies such as Microsoft and America Online. By 1991 he became president and chief operating officer at Alex. Brown, second to future CIA Executive Director A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard.
In 1997, they helped engineer the company's sale to Bankers Trust for $1.7 billion. After Bankers Trust was acquired by Deutsche Bank, Shattuck served as Chairman of the Board of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and also served as heads of Investment Banking and Private Banking. Shattuck resigned on September 12, 2001 as head of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.[9]
On October 26, 2001, Shattuck was appointed President and CEO of Constellation Energy Group, and was elected Chairman of the Board in July 2002.
While Shattuck was CEO of Constellation Energy, the price of electricity paid by residential customers in the service area of the CEG wholly owned company BGE increased 72% when the temporary electricity rate price caps, which had set the price of electricity below the market price and were instituted with the deregulation of the electric market in Maryland, ended. In 2008, the stock price of Constellation Energy dropped from a $107.97 high to a low of $13.00.[10] Shattuck was paid $15.7 million in 2010. The Maryland governor complained about Shattuck's pay, as did the editorial page of The Baltimore Sun, members of the Maryland Legislature, and some of the largest Constellation shareholders, to no avail. Shattuck chaired the company’s board, the same board that set his pay.[11]
After Exelon completed its acquisition of Constellation Energy, Shattuck assumed the new role of Executive Chairman reporting under Exelon CEO Christopher Crane. Shattuck retired from Exelon on February 28, 2013 [12]
Other affiliations[edit]
In 1997, Mayo Shattuck was made trustee of the Seagram Company, Ltd.
Shattuck has several other notable past and current affiliations, including directorships at Gap, Inc and Capital One,[13] positions on several lobbying and policy advocacy organizations (including the Edison Electric Institute, the Nuclear Energy Institute and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations), board memberships at several educational institutions (Johns Hopkins, Stanford and the University of Maryland) and at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.
Personal life[edit]
Shattuck was married to Molly Shattuck (née George), his second wife, known for being the oldest Baltimore Ravens cheerleader in NFL history and, later, for having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy.[14][15][16] They have three children, Spencer, Wyatt and Lillian, and in March 2014, Molly Shattuck said she had separated from Mayo Shattuck.[17] On September 29, 2014, Mayo Shattuck filed for divorce. On November 3, 2014, the Shattucks were officially divorced in Baltimore County.[18]
Shattuck has two children, Mayo IV and Kathleen (Katie), from his first marriage to Jennifer W. Budge.[19][20]

Early life and education[edit]
Shattuck was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1954. He attended the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts.[5] Shattuck's father was "heavily involved in the Boston investment community," and he managed Harvard's endowment and also served as a managing director at one of Boston's most respected institutional money managers. Shattuck's father passed away in 1974.[5]
Shattuck received a Bachelor of Arts from Williams College in 1976 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1980. Shattuck graduated as an Arjay Miller Scholar.[6][7][8]
Career[edit]
Not much is known about Shattuck's career before joining Alex. Brown & Sons at its San Francisco office, where he played a role in arranging funding for various high-tech clients and public offerings for companies such as Microsoft and America Online. By 1991 he became president and chief operating officer at Alex. Brown, second to future CIA Executive Director A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard.
In 1997, they helped engineer the company's sale to Bankers Trust for $1.7 billion. After Bankers Trust was acquired by Deutsche Bank, Shattuck served as Chairman of the Board of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and also served as heads of Investment Banking and Private Banking. Shattuck resigned on September 12, 2001 as head of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.[9]
On October 26, 2001, Shattuck was appointed President and CEO of Constellation Energy Group, and was elected Chairman of the Board in July 2002.
While Shattuck was CEO of Constellation Energy, the price of electricity paid by residential customers in the service area of the CEG wholly owned company BGE increased 72% when the temporary electricity rate price caps, which had set the price of electricity below the market price and were instituted with the deregulation of the electric market in Maryland, ended. In 2008, the stock price of Constellation Energy dropped from a $107.97 high to a low of $13.00.[10] Shattuck was paid $15.7 million in 2010. The Maryland governor complained about Shattuck's pay, as did the editorial page of The Baltimore Sun, members of the Maryland Legislature, and some of the largest Constellation shareholders, to no avail. Shattuck chaired the company’s board, the same board that set his pay.[11]
After Exelon completed its acquisition of Constellation Energy, Shattuck assumed the new role of Executive Chairman reporting under Exelon CEO Christopher Crane. Shattuck retired from Exelon on February 28, 2013 [12]
Other affiliations[edit]
In 1997, Mayo Shattuck was made trustee of the Seagram Company, Ltd.
Shattuck has several other notable past and current affiliations, including directorships at Gap, Inc and Capital One,[13] positions on several lobbying and policy advocacy organizations (including the Edison Electric Institute, the Nuclear Energy Institute and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations), board memberships at several educational institutions (Johns Hopkins, Stanford and the University of Maryland) and at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.
Personal life[edit]
Shattuck was married to Molly Shattuck (née George), his second wife, known for being the oldest Baltimore Ravens cheerleader in NFL history and, later, for having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy.[14][15][16] They have three children, Spencer, Wyatt and Lillian, and in March 2014, Molly Shattuck said she had separated from Mayo Shattuck.[17] On September 29, 2014, Mayo Shattuck filed for divorce. On November 3, 2014, the Shattucks were officially divorced in Baltimore County.[18]
Shattuck has two children, Mayo IV and Kathleen (Katie), from his first marriage to Jennifer W. Budge.[19][20]

The couple met in April 2009, one month before Mr. Markov graduated from Stanford and moved to New York.“I thought he was very smart, very funny and very nice, and we just sort of clicked,” said Ms. Shattuck, who was one academic year behind Mr. Markov. “It was frustrating to finally meet someone I could see a future with, but to know that it probably wouldn’t last because he was moving across the country.”Still, they decided to give their brief, newfound love a chance by embarking on a long-distance relationship.

Brown & Sons at its San Francisco office, where he played a role in arranging funding for various high-tech clients and public offerings for companies such as Microsoft and America Online.

Molly Shattuck charged with sexual relationship with a minor




Molly Shattuck, the former Ravens cheerleader who was married to onetime Constellation Energy CEO Mayo A. Shattuck III, was arrested Wednesday and charged with third-degree rape and unlawful sexual contact with a 15-year-old boy, Delaware State Police said.The 47-year-old mother of three, who has been active in local charities such as the United Way of Central Maryland and the Baltimore School for the Arts, is accused of giving alcohol to the boy, who is her son's classmate, and performing oral sex on him at a Delaware beach house over the Labor Day weekend, according to an affidavit for a search warrant filed in Baltimore County District Court.Shattuck was arraigned Wednesday morning in Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Del. She pleaded not guilty and was released on $84,000 bond — on the condition that she have no contact with the alleged victim or other minors except her own children, according to the Delaware attorney general's office. She was also required to turn in her passport, officials said."She is maintaining her innocence," said Shattuck's defense lawyer, Eugene Maurer, of Wilmington, Del. "She is obviously quite distraught." Shattuck is due back in court Dec. 3 for a case review, Maurer said.

A Delaware grand jury handed up a nine-count indictment against Shattuck on Monday, and it was unsealed Wednesday. She was charged with two counts of third-degree rape, which carries a potential sentence of two to 25 years in prison on each count; four counts of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree, with a penalty of up to three years in prison, and three counts of providing alcohol to a minor, which carries a fine of $100 to $500 and could lead to an order of community service or imprisonment of up to 60 days.










The news that Molly Shattuck, the former Ravens cheerleader and ex-wife of a prominent businessman, was charged in Delaware with third-degree rape and unlawful sexual contact with a teenage boy has instantly spread across the country and even overseas on sites in England and Australia.



According to the affidavit, the boy — a student at the McDonogh School — told police that Shattuck began a flirtation with him on the social networking site Instagram in May.The Baltimore Sun does not name alleged victims of sexual crimes.The McDonogh School issued a statement Wednesday saying that administrators contacted police in late September as soon as they learned of allegations involving a student and a parent of another student.

"The safety and well-being of our students is our greatest priority at all times," Headmaster Charles W. Britton wrote to parents of McDonogh students in an email Wednesday. The letter said the parent — who was not named — had been banned from campus.









Shattuck, a self-styled fitness and lifestyle guru who was the oldest cheerleader in the history of the NFL, began sending provocative messages to the boy in the spring saying, "we would have fun together," according to the affidavit.The two had sexual contact in the parking lot of a Columbia movie theater, the affidavit said, and also drove to a middle school parking lot  where they kissed in the back seat of Shattuck's Cadillac Escalade.In the summer, she would pick up the boy during his lunch breaks from a class and drive him to the parking garage of the T. Rowe Price building in Owings Mills where they would "get in the back of the car and kiss or 'make out,'" according to the affidavit.Over Labor Day weekend, the boy joined Shattuck and her three children — who range in age from 11 to 15 — and their friends at a Bethany Beach rental home, according to the affidavit. The boy, who had traveled to the beach separately, asked his father for permission to spend the night with Shattuck's family. Shattuck, documents say, assured the boy's father that "there was no alcohol or drugs at the residence and she was the only adult."However, she shared wine with the alleged victim while he played "music and games" with the other boys, according to the affidavit. Around 2 a.m., Shattuck left the younger children asleep in the rental home and took the alleged victim and other teenagers to a liquor store and purchased Miller Lite and Bud Light beer for them, the document states.Back at the house, Shattuck asked the alleged victim to help her walk the dog. Once they got outside, she began kissing and fondling him, then performed oral sex on him, according to the affidavit. The boy then went up to a rooftop deck, where he and the other teens drank alcohol.Shattuck then "came up and said that [the alleged victim] needs to go to bed," according to the affidavit.The boy then went into Shattuck's bedroom, where she stripped to her underwear, performed oral sex on him again and told him she would be willing to have intercourse, the affidavit states. He decided to leave the bedroom. The boy's father picked him up in the morning, and the boy has not had contact with Shattuck since the incident, according to the affidavit.According to the letter from the headmaster of the McDonogh School, he learned of allegations against a parent on Sept. 24. Britton said in the letter that he immediately reported the allegations to Baltimore County police."I want you to know that the parent has been prohibited from entering McDonogh's campus," he wrote, "and additional security measures have been in place to assure the safety of our students since the incident was reported."Delaware authorities said in a statement that Baltimore County police contacted them Sept. 26 to report that the 15-year-old had said he had an inappropriate relationship with a woman later identified as Shattuck.Delaware State Police searched Shattuck's North Baltimore home Oct. 1, seizing items they identified as "pertinent to the investigation." The affidavit gave police permission to seize Shattuck's cellphone, computers and other electronic devices as well as the "pink lace bra and underwear" that the alleged victim said Shattuck wore at the beach house.Howard County police said Wednesday that the alleged incident at the Columbia movie theater was not reported to authorities at the time.Police are investigating the allegations, said Howard police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn.Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott D. Shellenberger said his office had "reviewed the facts and the circumstances of the allegations" but was deferring prosecution due to the "seriousness of the allegations in Delaware.""Should additional facts come to light or circumstances change in the case in Delaware, this decision will be revisited," Shellenberger said.A spokeswoman with the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore said Shattuck had not been charged by that agency. The agency will neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, she said.

No one answered Shattuck's front door — still decorated with black and orange streamers for Halloween — at her home Wednesday morning. Neighbors either declined to comment or said they did not know the Shattucks well.Mayo Shattuck, who before joining Constellation was chairman of the board of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, referred calls to a family spokesman, George P. Stamas, also formerly with the investment firm."Mr. Shattuck is shocked and saddened about the allegations against his ex-wife, from whom he is divorced," said Stamas, now a senior partner at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Washington. "He is focused on the care and welfare of his children, who are with him, and is deeply concerned about others affected by this. He requests that the privacy of his children be respected."Mayo Shattuck is now chairman of Exelon Corp., the Chicago-based energy giant that acquired Constellation in 2012.Michelle N. Lipkowitz, a Baltimore-based attorney representing Molly Shattuck, said her client has resigned from all of her nonprofit boards, including the Baltimore School for the Arts, United Way and the National Children's Museum."It is a difficult time for all involved," Lipkowitz said, declining further comment.The United Way of Central Maryland said Molly Shattuck, who sat on their board and was "a longtime volunteer," is barred from any future participation with the organization, according to spokeswoman Danielle Hogan.The allegations about Molly Shattuck had circulated through Baltimore for weeks before the indictment was handed up. As rumors spread, a website promoting her book, "Molly Shattuck Vibrant Living," went into maintenance mode and her various social media accounts were shut down."It's the talk of the town. It's probably the most sensational thing that's ever hit Baltimore," said Lainy LeBow-Sachs, executive vice president at the Kennedy Kreiger Institute and a prominent player in the local philanthropic community." I think it's a very sad time. It's sad for the children and the family, and it's sad for her. The whole thing is just pathetic."Adam Rosenberg, executive director of the nonprofit Baltimore Child Abuse Center, said people mistakenly tend to trivialize the impact of sexual abuse on a teenage male. Speaking not about the alleged victim in the Shattuck case but about teenage boys in general, he said, "Even though he may look and act like an adult, his brain is not there yet. A 15-year-old doesn't know he is being manipulated, he is being taken advantage of and ultimately exploited."Rosenberg suggested that parents closely monitor their children's use of social media."It takes a community to protect children," he said. "If other adults and children are seeing behavior between adults and children that doesn't seem right, they need to report it."The former Molly Ann George grew up in the small manufacturing town of Kittanning, Pa., about 50 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. She was captain of the varsity cheerleading team and voted most popular in high school. She graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1989, where she majored in marketing.She met her future husband in the mid 1990s when she was working in marketing at Alex. Brown. At the time, Mayo Shattuck was president and chief operating officer of the investment bank. Shattuck and his first wife, Jennifer, with whom he has two children, divorced in 1995. Molly and Mayo were married in 1997.Molly Shattuck became the oldest cheerleader in NFL history when she joined the Ravens squad at age 38 in 2005. Her husband had been deeply involved in the sale of a minority ownership position in the team about five years earlier. Ravens spokesman Kevin Byrne declined to comment on the allegations.She launched a health and exercise website, video and book called "Molly Shattuck Vibrant Living." The book, which was published in March, offers a 21-day plan to "transform your body, burst with energy, and live your life with purpose."She appeared, with her mother, Joan George, in a 2008 episode of the Fox reality show "Secret Millionaire." Shattuck and George posed as low-wage workers in a Pennsylvania mining town, got to know a few people who were in need, then, with the big reveal, gave away close to $200,000 to those they had met.In 2005, Molly Shattuck told The Sun that she didn't have a serious boyfriend in high school and skipped the senior prom to hike in the Grand Canyon. She had seen other girls in her town marry young and never leave."I guess I was focused on other things," she said in the profile. "I knew I was going to leave. I knew I was going to see the world."julie.scharper@baltsun.comjean.marbella@baltsun.comtwitter.com/juliemoretwitter.com/jean_marbellaBaltimore Sun reporters Jessica Anderson, Doug Donovan, Justin Fenton, Justin George and Carrie Wells contributed to this article.

Early life and education[edit]
Shattuck was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1954. He attended the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts.[5] Shattuck's father was "heavily involved in the Boston investment community," and he managed Harvard's endowment and also served as a managing director at one of Boston's most respected institutional money managers. Shattuck's father passed away in 1974.[5]
Shattuck received a Bachelor of Arts from Williams College in 1976 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1980. Shattuck graduated as an Arjay Miller Scholar.[6][7][8]
Career[edit]
Not much is known about Shattuck's career before joining Alex. Brown & Sons at its San Francisco office, where he played a role in arranging funding for various high-tech clients and public offerings for companies such as Microsoft and America Online. By 1991 he became president and chief operating officer at Alex. Brown, second to future CIA Executive Director A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard.
In 1997, they helped engineer the company's sale to Bankers Trust for $1.7 billion. After Bankers Trust was acquired by Deutsche Bank, Shattuck served as Chairman of the Board of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and also served as heads of Investment Banking and Private Banking. Shattuck resigned on September 12, 2001 as head of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.[9]
On October 26, 2001, Shattuck was appointed President and CEO of Constellation Energy Group, and was elected Chairman of the Board in July 2002.
While Shattuck was CEO of Constellation Energy, the price of electricity paid by residential customers in the service area of the CEG wholly owned company BGE increased 72% when the temporary electricity rate price caps, which had set the price of electricity below the market price and were instituted with the deregulation of the electric market in Maryland, ended. In 2008, the stock price of Constellation Energy dropped from a $107.97 high to a low of $13.00.[10] Shattuck was paid $15.7 million in 2010. The Maryland governor complained about Shattuck's pay, as did the editorial page of The Baltimore Sun, members of the Maryland Legislature, and some of the largest Constellation shareholders, to no avail. Shattuck chaired the company’s board, the same board that set his pay.[11]
After Exelon completed its acquisition of Constellation Energy, Shattuck assumed the new role of Executive Chairman reporting under Exelon CEO Christopher Crane. Shattuck retired from Exelon on February 28, 2013 [12]
Other affiliations[edit]
In 1997, Mayo Shattuck was made trustee of the Seagram Company, Ltd.
Shattuck has several other notable past and current affiliations, including directorships at Gap, Inc and Capital One,[13] positions on several lobbying and policy advocacy organizations (including the Edison Electric Institute, the Nuclear Energy Institute and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations), board memberships at several educational institutions (Johns Hopkins, Stanford and the University of Maryland) and at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.
Personal life[edit]
Shattuck was married to Molly Shattuck (née George), his second wife, known for being the oldest Baltimore Ravens cheerleader in NFL history and, later, for having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy.[14][15][16] They have three children, Spencer, Wyatt and Lillian, and in March 2014, Molly Shattuck said she had separated from Mayo Shattuck.[17] On September 29, 2014, Mayo Shattuck filed for divorce. On November 3, 2014, the Shattucks were officially divorced in Baltimore County.[18]
Shattuck has two children, Mayo IV and Kathleen (Katie), from his first marriage to Jennifer W. Budge.[19][20]

Early life and education[edit]
Shattuck was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1954. He attended the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts.[5] Shattuck's father was "heavily involved in the Boston investment community," and he managed Harvard's endowment and also served as a managing director at one of Boston's most respected institutional money managers. Shattuck's father passed away in 1974.[5]
Shattuck received a Bachelor of Arts from Williams College in 1976 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1980. Shattuck graduated as an Arjay Miller Scholar.[6][7][8]
Career[edit]
Not much is known about Shattuck's career before joining Alex. Brown & Sons at its San Francisco office, where he played a role in arranging funding for various high-tech clients and public offerings for companies such as Microsoft and America Online. By 1991 he became president and chief operating officer at Alex. Brown, second to future CIA Executive Director A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard.
In 1997, they helped engineer the company's sale to Bankers Trust for $1.7 billion. After Bankers Trust was acquired by Deutsche Bank, Shattuck served as Chairman of the Board of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and also served as heads of Investment Banking and Private Banking. Shattuck resigned on September 12, 2001 as head of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.[9]
On October 26, 2001, Shattuck was appointed President and CEO of Constellation Energy Group, and was elected Chairman of the Board in July 2002.
While Shattuck was CEO of Constellation Energy, the price of electricity paid by residential customers in the service area of the CEG wholly owned company BGE increased 72% when the temporary electricity rate price caps, which had set the price of electricity below the market price and were instituted with the deregulation of the electric market in Maryland, ended. In 2008, the stock price of Constellation Energy dropped from a $107.97 high to a low of $13.00.[10] Shattuck was paid $15.7 million in 2010. The Maryland governor complained about Shattuck's pay, as did the editorial page of The Baltimore Sun, members of the Maryland Legislature, and some of the largest Constellation shareholders, to no avail. Shattuck chaired the company’s board, the same board that set his pay.[11]
After Exelon completed its acquisition of Constellation Energy, Shattuck assumed the new role of Executive Chairman reporting under Exelon CEO Christopher Crane. Shattuck retired from Exelon on February 28, 2013 [12]
Other affiliations[edit]
In 1997, Mayo Shattuck was made trustee of the Seagram Company, Ltd.
Shattuck has several other notable past and current affiliations, including directorships at Gap, Inc and Capital One,[13] positions on several lobbying and policy advocacy organizations (including the Edison Electric Institute, the Nuclear Energy Institute and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations), board memberships at several educational institutions (Johns Hopkins, Stanford and the University of Maryland) and at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.
Personal life[edit]
Shattuck was married to Molly Shattuck (née George), his second wife, known for being the oldest Baltimore Ravens cheerleader in NFL history and, later, for having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy.[14][15][16] They have three children, Spencer, Wyatt and Lillian, and in March 2014, Molly Shattuck said she had separated from Mayo Shattuck.[17] On September 29, 2014, Mayo Shattuck filed for divorce. On November 3, 2014, the Shattucks were officially divorced in Baltimore County.[18]
Shattuck has two children, Mayo IV and Kathleen (Katie), from his first marriage to Jennifer W. Budge.[19][20]

Former Constellation Energy CEO (now Exelon executive chairman) Mayo A. Shattuck III makes a lot of money. Probably more than you. I’m not saying he’s the richest person in Baltimore, but among the area’s public company CEOs he was the highest paid last year — by far — with a gross income of $17.4 million (if you figure in retirement benefits and stock awards), according to a Sun investigative report.
It’s easy to hate on this figure, especially when you discover that Constellation recorded $300 million in losses last year, and when you divide it by 2,080 and realize the guy essentially makes $8,365 an hour. That’s about 740 times the living wage in Baltimore City and about 1,150 times minimum wage.
And this is right about where the Occupy movement’s consensus on what’s wrong with the country ends — absurd income inequality. So what do we do about it? That’s where opinions really diverge. Certainly an easy — but maybe not very effective — option is to simply call out the most perversely wealthy among us and make some calculations with their salary to indulge in righteous anger (and to some extent, awe) at the fantastic wealth a few individuals happen to command.
If you want to tinker around with some disturbing numbers while you figure out how to make capitalism work backwards, visit the Sun‘s interactive chart, “Executive Compensation in Maryland – 2011” and compare it to MIT’s living wage calculator for Baltimore City.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
