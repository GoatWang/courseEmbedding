If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Ranks Highest in Full Service Investor Satisfaction for Second Consecutive Year


 






Costa Mesa, Calif.: 6 April 2017 — Emerging affluent investors—defined as Millennials1 with $100,000 in investable assets—currently control the largest portion of at-risk assets managed by full service financial advisors, according to the J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study,SM released today. Surprisingly, half (48%) of emerging affluent investors currently working with an advisor say they “probably will” or “definitely will” leave their current firm, compared with just 8% among all other generations of investors. "Wealth managers have been slow to focus on Millennials because they don’t yet have the assets Boomers do, but when looking at potential money in motion—even in the short term—the picture looks quite different," said Mike Foy, director of the wealth management practice at J.D. Power. "With the emergence of robo-advisors and self-directed platforms, investors have more options than ever, both within and outside the traditional full-service channel."The study captures the clearest evidence to date of a historic generational shift that is currently unfolding in the wealth management space. Noting distinct differences between Millennials and other generational groups on indicators such as overall satisfaction, economic outlook, advisor and firm loyalty, and advocacy/referrals, this year’s study suggests that advisory firms will need to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of this growing customer base.Following are some of the key generational findings in the study:Millennial money in motion: An alarming 48% of emerging affluent Millennials indicate they will definitely or probably leave their current provider in the next 12 months versus only 8% of other investors. While emerging affluent Millennials still represent just 8% of the overall available investable asset pool, they represent 55% of assets held by investors who are currently at risk of leaving their current investment firm.Evolving investor needs: Today, just 54% of full service investors have a documented financial plan and while those plans generally address retirement planning, these investors are much less likely to feel they are addressing other financial goals that are a higher priority for Millennials (e.g., major purchase or education planning) or for Boomers who are leaving the work force (e.g., capital preservation or estate planning).Brave new world of referrals: The firms that are able to create loyalty among Millennial clients today can expect significant ongoing rewards. Among those clients identified as highly likely to recommend, Millennials made more positive recommendations during the past 12 months (an average of 8.1 per client) than did Boomers (3.3 per client) and Gen X (3.7 per client) combined. But advisors and firms need to actively cultivate this referral source: Millennials indicated they would be more likely to provide referrals if their advisor asked (40%) or they were incentivized to do so (39%).Risk of channel defection: One-fourth (25%) of full-service Millennial investors have either tried, or are actively using, a robo-advisor platform and 28% of them rate their satisfaction with this platform higher than for their full-service firm. Also, more than one-third (34%) have a secondary self-directed account, suggesting a flexibility and openness to a variety of service models not exhibited by investors in other generational groups. Study RankingsCharles Schwab & Co., Inc. (838) ranks highest in overall investor satisfaction for a second consecutive year, followed by Fidelity Investments (835) and Edward Jones (833).The U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study, now in its 15th year, measures overall investor satisfaction with full service investment firms in seven factors (in order of importance): financial advisor; investment performance; account information; product offerings; commissions and fees; website; and problem resolution. This year, overall investor satisfaction is up 15 points to 819 (on a 1,000-point scale) from 2016.The study was fielded in January 2017 and is based on responses from more than 6,500 investors who make some or all of their investment decisions with a financial advisor.For more information about the 2017 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-full-service-investor-satisfaction-study.See the online press release at http://www.jdpower.com/pr-id/2017037.J.D.

What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

                      1. Unlimited ATM fee rebates apply to cash withdrawals using the Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum debit card (also referred to as a "check card" or "Visa check card") wherever it is accepted. ATM fee rebates do not apply to any fees other than fees assessed for using an ATM to withdraw cash from your Schwab Bank account. Schwab Bank makes its best effort to identify those ATM fees eligible for rebate, based on information it receives from Visa and ATM operators. In the event that you have not received a rebate for a fee that you believe is eligible, please call a Schwab Bank Client Service Specialist for assistance at 888-403-9000. Schwab Bank reserves the right to modify or discontinue the ATM fee rebate at any time.
                      

                      2. Schwab Bank does not assess foreign transaction fees (i.e., a fee to convert US Dollars to local currency) to debit cardholders.
                      

                        3. Funds deposited at Charles Schwab Bank are insured, in aggregate, up to $250,000 based on account ownership type, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                      

                        Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking accounts are available only as linked accounts with Schwab One® accounts. The Schwab One brokerage account has no minimum balance requirements, and there is no requirement to fund this account, when it is opened with a linked High Yield Investor Checking account.

Annual guaranteed income8
Beginning at age 65 you can receive 5% of the Protected Payment Base for the single life rider and 4.5% for the joint life rider.
Beginning as early as age 59½
, you can begin receiving annual withdrawals ranging from 3.5-6.5% of the Benefit Base depending on age and single or joint life. See details.


The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits referenced above are optional riders for which you will incur an additional charge, as shown above. The Protected Payment/Benefit Base on which the guaranteed lifetime income is based is not a contract value, cannot be accessed like a cash value, and cannot be left to your beneficiaries as a death benefit. Additionally, a GLWB will not preserve your contract value, which will decrease with each withdrawal until it reaches zero, although payments under the terms of the rider will still continue for life. Restrictions and limitations apply. See the prospectus for details. 


Death benefit 
 
 


Return of account value
Beneficiaries receive any remaining contract value, less premium taxes prior to annuitization.
Beneficiaries receive current account value (less premium taxes). Available for those age 85 or under at time of purchase.


Optional death benefits
 If protecting your beneficiaries is a priority, you can purchase one of two optional death benefits for an additional fee at the time you purchase the annuity. These optional death benefits are available for purchase to owners and annuitants 75 years or younger. Cannot be combined with the GLWB option.
The Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit provides your beneficiaries with the greater of the contract value or the total of purchase payments, adjusted for withdrawals prior to annuitization. 
Additional cost 0.20%  
The Stepped-Up Death Benefit offers you the potential to lock in market gains for your beneficiaries. Additional cost 0.40% 



Beneficiaries receive total contributions (less the proportional impact of any distributions, withdrawals, and premium taxes) or the contract value (less premium taxes), whichever is greater. Available for those age 80 or under at time of purchase. Additional cost 0.20%.

Annuity Frequently Asked Questions

What is a variable annuity?


A variable annuity is a long-term investment for retirement that can provide guaranteed lifetime income, may have guaranteed death benefit options, has a variety of investment options, and provides tax-deferred growth potential. Many variable annuities also offer an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB), for an additional cost, that provides protection of lifetime guaranteed income for you and your spouse. Variable annuities with an optional death benefit can provide you with the confidence in knowing your assets are protected for your beneficiaries for an additional cost. 
Note:  A GLWB is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. The actual contract value will deplete with each withdrawal. 




What might make a variable annuity a good option for your situation?


Variable annuities offer benefits that can help you reach your retirement goals and maintain your standard of living when retired. The income from these types of annuities can provide regular income for years, or even for life. 





What potential drawbacks should I be aware of?


For variable annuities you will typically see insurance charges (pays for the guarantees that the insurance company provides), surrender charges (charge on an early withdrawal based on a the time period of the policy or cancellation of the policy), investment fees (pays for the management of the underlying investment options), and fees for optional living benefits or optional death benefits (fees that pay for the guarantees that the optional benefits provide). Variable annuities offered by Charles Schwab do not have surrender charges.  
Withdrawals from an annuity will reduce the value of your annuity, and withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty. 
The performance of the underlying investment options is subject to market fluctuation and are not guaranteed. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuity might fit your retirement strategy.




Are variable annuities right for me?


If you are seeking the potential for asset growth before retirement with income protection and guaranteed lifetime income in retirement, variable annuities could be right for you. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuity might fit your retirement strategy. 




What does the annuity calculator do?


The Variable Annuity Expense Calculator helps you determine how much you might be able to save in fees by exchanging your current variable annuity to a Charles Schwab low-cost variable annuity1: Schwab Retirement Income Variable Annuity® and Schwab OneSource Choice Variable Annuity™. Use this calculator to get an idea about whether an exchange might be in your best interest, then for a more comprehensive assessment, talk with a Schwab consultant at your local branch. To speak with a Schwab annuity consultant, call 888-311-4889. 
When considering an exchange, expenses are only one factor. Before replacing your current annuity, please also consider surrender charges on your existing contract, the potential loss of any guaranteed benefits, and differences in features, costs, services, and company strength as well as factors that could reduce or eliminate the benefit of the exchange.




How do I use the calculator?


There are three simple steps once you're on the Variable Annuity Expense Calculator page:

Enter your existing annuity either by the annuity name or the insurance company. 
Select a Schwab Annuity. 
Analyze your expenses.
Be sure to contact your Schwab consultant or call 888-311-4889 to speak with a licensed annuity specialist about whether you might benefit from a tax-free exchange.

Current operations[edit]
Schwab operates in four main divisions: investing, wealth management, banking, and trading. As of December 31, 2016, the company had 10.155 million active client brokerage accounts, with $2.779 trillion in assets.[2] The company operated 335 branches in 46 states, as well as a branch in each of Puerto Rico and London.[2]
History[edit]
In 1963, Charles R. Schwab and two other partners launched Investment Indicator, an investment newsletter.[3] At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe.[3] In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Mr. Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Mr. Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries.[3] In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.[3]
In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed for negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a discount brokerage.[3] In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1980, Schwab established the industry’s first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000.[3] In 1981, Schwab became a member of the NYSE, and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000.[1]
In 1983, the company was purchased by Bank of America for $55 million.[3] In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load mutual funds. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company from Bank of America for $280 million.[4][3]
In 1991, the company acquired Mayer & Scweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers' orders without sending them to an exchange.[5] In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers.[6] The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000.[7]
In 1993, the company opened an office in London.[3]
In 1995, the company acquired The Hampton Company, founded by Walter W. Bettinger, who became CEO of Schwab in 2008.[8][3]
In 2000, Schwab purchased U.S. Trust for $2.73 billion.[9] In 2001, less than a year after the acquisition of U.S. Trust, the U.S. Trust subsidiary was fined $10 million in a bank secrecy law case. It was ordered to pay $5 million to the New York State Banking Department and $5 million to the Federal Reserve Board.[10] On November 20, 2006, Schwab announced an agreement to sell U.S. Trust to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash.[11] The deal closed in the second quarter of 2007.
In November 2003, Schwab announced the $345 million acquisition of SoundView Technology Group to add equity research capabilities.[12][3][13]
David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab's right-hand man, shared the CEO title with the company's founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company's board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck's removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10 percent, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26 percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading.
After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had "lost touch with our heritage", and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck’s fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck’s removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab.[14] The company’s net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008.
Schwab YieldPlus Fund. This fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the 2000s.[15] “In written materials and in conversations with customers, some Schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the fund's characteristics, risk and diversification, and continued to represent YieldPlus as a relatively low-risk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Between Sept. 1, 2006, and Feb. 29, 2008, Schwab sold over $13.75 billion in shares of YieldPlus to customers, which accounted for approximately 98 percent of the amount Schwab customers invested in ultra short-term bond funds. During this time period, Schwab's solicited sales of YieldPlus totaled approximately $3.36 billion, approximately 40 percent of which were to customers 65 years of age or older. Schwab collected approximately $17.5 million in fees from sales of the fund.” [16] "From June 2007 through June 2008, the total return on Schwab’s YieldPlus fund YieldPlus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid, long-term, private label mortgages. It also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities. In doing so, Schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its SEC filings and marketing materials. YieldPlus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to 2007. Unfortunately, the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in 2007 and 2008. was -31.7% when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses. These large losses occurred because Schwab’s YieldPlus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by Schwab. It was instead an ultra long bond fund. YieldPlus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early 2008, yet Schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its NAV....The YieldPlus fund made large, risky investments in long maturity structured products, such as subprime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (“RMBS”) that were inconsistent with the SEC’s definition of an ultra short bond fund. Schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk. Such a claim would be incorrect for a typical, conventionally managed ultra short bond fund, but was especially false when made by Schwab on behalf of the YieldPlus fund. In its marketing materials, Schwab compared returns on the YieldPlus fund to returns on the Lehman Short U.S. Treasury 9-12 month index. The Treasury securities included in the Lehman index have no credit risk, are highly liquid and have short maturities. The holdings of the YieldPlus fund generally shared none of these attributes" [17] YieldPlus had $1.1 billion of investor losses, including losses by the founder himself.[18] Schwab closed the YieldPlus funds in 2011 [19]
In 2007, the company acquired The 401(k) Company.[20][3]
On July 22, 2008, Walter W. Bettinger, the previous chief operating officer, was named chief executive, succeeding the company's namesake. Charles R. Schwab remained executive chairman of the company and said in a statement that he would "continue to serve as a very active chairman." Bettinger stated: "Chuck and I have worked closely together over the years preparing for this transition and we will continue to work closely together in our respective roles as executive chairman and CEO."[21]
In 2011, the company acquired OptionsXpress.[22]
In 2012, the company acquired ThomasPartners, an asset management firm.[23]
Marketing[edit]
In 2004, Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) was chosen by Charles Schwab as its full-service advertising agency. In February 2013 Schwab announced that they had hired Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) as their lead creative agency with Havas Worldwide remaining to create ads for ActiveTrader and optionsXpress.[24] In March 2015 Adweek reported on marketing material created by CP+B for Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio service.[25]
Starting in 2005, the company launched a series of television ads featuring the slogan "Talk to Chuck". The TV ads were produced by Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) and directed/animated by Bob Sabiston's Flat Black Films. "Talk to Chuck" ads appeared in print media, online, billboards, and branch offices.[26] A Wall Street Journal blog post described the ads as effective because they included a single memorable phrase.[27]
In 2013, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan "Own Your Tomorrow".[28]
Schwab Charitable Fund[edit]
Schwab Charitable Fund is a donor advised fund which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names. Professionally-managed accounts are only available through independent investment advisors working with Schwab Advisor Services, a business segment of The Charles Schwab Corporation. It accepts contributions of real estate, private equity or other non-cash assets via a charitable intermediary, with proceeds of your donation transferred to a donor-advised account upon liquidation. This intermediary considers donations on a case-by-case basis, with a typical requirement that assets be valued at $250,000 or more.[29]

Current operations[edit]
Schwab operates in four main divisions: investing, wealth management, banking, and trading. As of December 31, 2016, the company had 10.155 million active client brokerage accounts, with $2.779 trillion in assets.[2] The company operated 335 branches in 46 states, as well as a branch in each of Puerto Rico and London.[2]
History[edit]
In 1963, Charles R. Schwab and two other partners launched Investment Indicator, an investment newsletter.[3] At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe.[3] In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Mr. Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Mr. Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries.[3] In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.[3]
In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed for negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a discount brokerage.[3] In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1980, Schwab established the industry’s first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000.[3] In 1981, Schwab became a member of the NYSE, and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000.[1]
In 1983, the company was purchased by Bank of America for $55 million.[3] In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load mutual funds. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company from Bank of America for $280 million.[4][3]
In 1991, the company acquired Mayer & Scweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers' orders without sending them to an exchange.[5] In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers.[6] The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000.[7]
In 1993, the company opened an office in London.[3]
In 1995, the company acquired The Hampton Company, founded by Walter W. Bettinger, who became CEO of Schwab in 2008.[8][3]
In 2000, Schwab purchased U.S. Trust for $2.73 billion.[9] In 2001, less than a year after the acquisition of U.S. Trust, the U.S. Trust subsidiary was fined $10 million in a bank secrecy law case. It was ordered to pay $5 million to the New York State Banking Department and $5 million to the Federal Reserve Board.[10] On November 20, 2006, Schwab announced an agreement to sell U.S. Trust to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash.[11] The deal closed in the second quarter of 2007.
In November 2003, Schwab announced the $345 million acquisition of SoundView Technology Group to add equity research capabilities.[12][3][13]
David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab's right-hand man, shared the CEO title with the company's founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company's board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck's removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10 percent, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26 percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading.
After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had "lost touch with our heritage", and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck’s fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck’s removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab.[14] The company’s net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008.
Schwab YieldPlus Fund. This fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the 2000s.[15] “In written materials and in conversations with customers, some Schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the fund's characteristics, risk and diversification, and continued to represent YieldPlus as a relatively low-risk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Between Sept. 1, 2006, and Feb. 29, 2008, Schwab sold over $13.75 billion in shares of YieldPlus to customers, which accounted for approximately 98 percent of the amount Schwab customers invested in ultra short-term bond funds. During this time period, Schwab's solicited sales of YieldPlus totaled approximately $3.36 billion, approximately 40 percent of which were to customers 65 years of age or older. Schwab collected approximately $17.5 million in fees from sales of the fund.” [16] "From June 2007 through June 2008, the total return on Schwab’s YieldPlus fund YieldPlus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid, long-term, private label mortgages. It also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities. In doing so, Schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its SEC filings and marketing materials. YieldPlus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to 2007. Unfortunately, the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in 2007 and 2008. was -31.7% when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses. These large losses occurred because Schwab’s YieldPlus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by Schwab. It was instead an ultra long bond fund. YieldPlus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early 2008, yet Schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its NAV....The YieldPlus fund made large, risky investments in long maturity structured products, such as subprime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (“RMBS”) that were inconsistent with the SEC’s definition of an ultra short bond fund. Schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk. Such a claim would be incorrect for a typical, conventionally managed ultra short bond fund, but was especially false when made by Schwab on behalf of the YieldPlus fund. In its marketing materials, Schwab compared returns on the YieldPlus fund to returns on the Lehman Short U.S. Treasury 9-12 month index. The Treasury securities included in the Lehman index have no credit risk, are highly liquid and have short maturities. The holdings of the YieldPlus fund generally shared none of these attributes" [17] YieldPlus had $1.1 billion of investor losses, including losses by the founder himself.[18] Schwab closed the YieldPlus funds in 2011 [19]
In 2007, the company acquired The 401(k) Company.[20][3]
On July 22, 2008, Walter W. Bettinger, the previous chief operating officer, was named chief executive, succeeding the company's namesake. Charles R. Schwab remained executive chairman of the company and said in a statement that he would "continue to serve as a very active chairman." Bettinger stated: "Chuck and I have worked closely together over the years preparing for this transition and we will continue to work closely together in our respective roles as executive chairman and CEO."[21]
In 2011, the company acquired OptionsXpress.[22]
In 2012, the company acquired ThomasPartners, an asset management firm.[23]
Marketing[edit]
In 2004, Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) was chosen by Charles Schwab as its full-service advertising agency. In February 2013 Schwab announced that they had hired Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) as their lead creative agency with Havas Worldwide remaining to create ads for ActiveTrader and optionsXpress.[24] In March 2015 Adweek reported on marketing material created by CP+B for Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio service.[25]
Starting in 2005, the company launched a series of television ads featuring the slogan "Talk to Chuck". The TV ads were produced by Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) and directed/animated by Bob Sabiston's Flat Black Films. "Talk to Chuck" ads appeared in print media, online, billboards, and branch offices.[26] A Wall Street Journal blog post described the ads as effective because they included a single memorable phrase.[27]
In 2013, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan "Own Your Tomorrow".[28]
Schwab Charitable Fund[edit]
Schwab Charitable Fund is a donor advised fund which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names. Professionally-managed accounts are only available through independent investment advisors working with Schwab Advisor Services, a business segment of The Charles Schwab Corporation. It accepts contributions of real estate, private equity or other non-cash assets via a charitable intermediary, with proceeds of your donation transferred to a donor-advised account upon liquidation. This intermediary considers donations on a case-by-case basis, with a typical requirement that assets be valued at $250,000 or more.[29]

Current operations[edit]
Schwab operates in four main divisions: investing, wealth management, banking, and trading. As of December 31, 2016, the company had 10.155 million active client brokerage accounts, with $2.779 trillion in assets.[2] The company operated 335 branches in 46 states, as well as a branch in each of Puerto Rico and London.[2]
History[edit]
In 1963, Charles R. Schwab and two other partners launched Investment Indicator, an investment newsletter.[3] At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe.[3] In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Mr. Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Mr. Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries.[3] In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.[3]
In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed for negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a discount brokerage.[3] In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1980, Schwab established the industry’s first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000.[3] In 1981, Schwab became a member of the NYSE, and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000.[1]
In 1983, the company was purchased by Bank of America for $55 million.[3] In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load mutual funds. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company from Bank of America for $280 million.[4][3]
In 1991, the company acquired Mayer & Scweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers' orders without sending them to an exchange.[5] In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers.[6] The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000.[7]
In 1993, the company opened an office in London.[3]
In 1995, the company acquired The Hampton Company, founded by Walter W. Bettinger, who became CEO of Schwab in 2008.[8][3]
In 2000, Schwab purchased U.S. Trust for $2.73 billion.[9] In 2001, less than a year after the acquisition of U.S. Trust, the U.S. Trust subsidiary was fined $10 million in a bank secrecy law case. It was ordered to pay $5 million to the New York State Banking Department and $5 million to the Federal Reserve Board.[10] On November 20, 2006, Schwab announced an agreement to sell U.S. Trust to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash.[11] The deal closed in the second quarter of 2007.
In November 2003, Schwab announced the $345 million acquisition of SoundView Technology Group to add equity research capabilities.[12][3][13]
David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab's right-hand man, shared the CEO title with the company's founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company's board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck's removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10 percent, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26 percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading.
After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had "lost touch with our heritage", and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck’s fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck’s removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab.[14] The company’s net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008.
Schwab YieldPlus Fund. This fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the 2000s.[15] “In written materials and in conversations with customers, some Schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the fund's characteristics, risk and diversification, and continued to represent YieldPlus as a relatively low-risk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Between Sept. 1, 2006, and Feb. 29, 2008, Schwab sold over $13.75 billion in shares of YieldPlus to customers, which accounted for approximately 98 percent of the amount Schwab customers invested in ultra short-term bond funds. During this time period, Schwab's solicited sales of YieldPlus totaled approximately $3.36 billion, approximately 40 percent of which were to customers 65 years of age or older. Schwab collected approximately $17.5 million in fees from sales of the fund.” [16] "From June 2007 through June 2008, the total return on Schwab’s YieldPlus fund YieldPlus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid, long-term, private label mortgages. It also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities. In doing so, Schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its SEC filings and marketing materials. YieldPlus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to 2007. Unfortunately, the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in 2007 and 2008. was -31.7% when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses. These large losses occurred because Schwab’s YieldPlus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by Schwab. It was instead an ultra long bond fund. YieldPlus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early 2008, yet Schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its NAV....The YieldPlus fund made large, risky investments in long maturity structured products, such as subprime Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (“RMBS”) that were inconsistent with the SEC’s definition of an ultra short bond fund. Schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk. Such a claim would be incorrect for a typical, conventionally managed ultra short bond fund, but was especially false when made by Schwab on behalf of the YieldPlus fund. In its marketing materials, Schwab compared returns on the YieldPlus fund to returns on the Lehman Short U.S. Treasury 9-12 month index. The Treasury securities included in the Lehman index have no credit risk, are highly liquid and have short maturities. The holdings of the YieldPlus fund generally shared none of these attributes" [17] YieldPlus had $1.1 billion of investor losses, including losses by the founder himself.[18] Schwab closed the YieldPlus funds in 2011 [19]
In 2007, the company acquired The 401(k) Company.[20][3]
On July 22, 2008, Walter W. Bettinger, the previous chief operating officer, was named chief executive, succeeding the company's namesake. Charles R. Schwab remained executive chairman of the company and said in a statement that he would "continue to serve as a very active chairman." Bettinger stated: "Chuck and I have worked closely together over the years preparing for this transition and we will continue to work closely together in our respective roles as executive chairman and CEO."[21]
In 2011, the company acquired OptionsXpress.[22]
In 2012, the company acquired ThomasPartners, an asset management firm.[23]
Marketing[edit]
In 2004, Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) was chosen by Charles Schwab as its full-service advertising agency. In February 2013 Schwab announced that they had hired Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) as their lead creative agency with Havas Worldwide remaining to create ads for ActiveTrader and optionsXpress.[24] In March 2015 Adweek reported on marketing material created by CP+B for Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio service.[25]
Starting in 2005, the company launched a series of television ads featuring the slogan "Talk to Chuck". The TV ads were produced by Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) and directed/animated by Bob Sabiston's Flat Black Films. "Talk to Chuck" ads appeared in print media, online, billboards, and branch offices.[26] A Wall Street Journal blog post described the ads as effective because they included a single memorable phrase.[27]
In 2013, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan "Own Your Tomorrow".[28]
Schwab Charitable Fund[edit]
Schwab Charitable Fund is a donor advised fund which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names. Professionally-managed accounts are only available through independent investment advisors working with Schwab Advisor Services, a business segment of The Charles Schwab Corporation. It accepts contributions of real estate, private equity or other non-cash assets via a charitable intermediary, with proceeds of your donation transferred to a donor-advised account upon liquidation. This intermediary considers donations on a case-by-case basis, with a typical requirement that assets be valued at $250,000 or more.[29]

Variable Annuity Expense Analyzer
Find out how much you might save by exchanging your current variable annuity for a low-cost Schwab annuity1. Use this calculator to get an idea about whether an exchange might be in your best interest, then for a more comprehensive assessment, talk with a Schwab consultant at your local branch. To speak with a Schwab annuity consultant, call 888-745-9679. 

There are a number of factors that must be considered before exchanging an existing contract. Among them are the surrender charges on the existing contract, potential loss of accrued living and death benefits, transaction costs associated with the exchange, the values of the new contract versus the old contract and the differences in features, costs, charges and expenses, services and company strength. You should also consider potential tax consequences. You should only consider initiating an exchange after carefully evaluating these factors and reviewing your existing contract.

Browse income products

Explore income categories and select examples of our products and services:


Stocks
Stocks have the potential to deliver a regular stream of dividend income that can grow over time to keep pace with inflation.3


Bonds
Bonds can provide diversification, cash flow, and steady income.


Cash & CDs
Cash & CDs are designed to provide liquidity and safety and to preserve your capital. Cash can fund your current spending and provide a short-term reserve to cover the unexpected.


Annuities
Certain annuities can help protect your income from market volatility and provide a guaranteed income stream for life.4



Professionally managed solutions available through Schwab provide a choice of ways to pursue your income-generating goals. Here are four examples that a Financial Consultant may discuss with you:

Schwab Intelligent Portfolios®
							Offered by Schwab Wealth Investment Advisory, Inc., Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is an automated, online advisory service that makes it easy to get a globally diversified ETF portfolio. Just select “Generate Income” as your goal, answer a few questions about your time horizon and risk tolerance, and set a monthly target withdrawal amount. Then Schwab Intelligent Portfolios will build and manage an investment portfolio for you to help you get a sustainable income stream based on your goals. This service does not charge advisory fees, commissions, or account service fees.*
Schwab Intelligent Advisory™
							Schwab Intelligent Advisory is a new approach to financial planning. First, you’ll identify your income goals and prioritize what’s most important. Then you’ll meet virtually with a Planning Consultant, who is a Certified Financial Planner™ professional. Your Planning Consultant will discuss your goals, work with you to fine-tune your plan and provide recommendations for one or multiple diversified portfolios composed of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You’ll come away from this meeting with a customized Action Plan of detailed next steps to help you reach your retirement income goals.
Fixed income managed accounts
							Get access to a range of fixed income strategies from respected asset management firms across the industry. Your Financial Consultant can recommend strategies based on your needs, such as municipal bonds, bond ladders, and core fixed income.
ThomasPartners®
							ThomasPartners® specializes in the construction and management of portfolios that seek to provide monthly income, income growth and competitive total returns over time.  With a similar investment philosophy, the firm offers two approaches: an equity strategy and a strategy blended with equities and fixed income. Both strive to deliver a reliable source of income to help you reach retirement and have the funds you need to get through it. 

Schwab Private Client™
							Schwab Private Client is designed to consider every aspect of your overall financial picture, including retirement income. Your dedicated team will work with you to assess your wealth management needs, develop a comprehensive plan, build a customized income-generating portfolio based on your needs, and manage your investments as your financial situation evolves. Using our modern approach to portfolio construction, your team will help you choose an asset allocation with an optimal blend of growth and income.



Questions you may have:

Q: Will my investments generate enough income to last a lifetime?

A: Today a married couple, both spouses age 65, has a nearly 75% chance of one spouse living past age 85. That's a retirement of over 20 years! To make your money last, you'll need to find ways to generate ongoing cash flow without depleting your assets too quickly. Your approach may include a mix of assets—such as bonds, annuities, cash, and dividend-paying stocks. The right mix can be complex to determine because it depends on your individual situation, but Schwab can help.



Q: How can I keep pace with increases in living expenses and health care?

A: Over a 20-year retirement, the cost of living may increase significantly. This means it's important to plan now for your future income needs to ensure you are prepared. A Schwab Financial Consultant can help, using sophisticated financial planning tools that consider expected future expenses, including health care and long-term care.



Q: What are some safe investments that generate income?

A: While some investments are less volatile than others, they may also provide a lower level of income. Therefore, it's important to consider a variety of investments to generate sufficient income without taking on too much risk. A Schwab Financial Consultant can evaluate how your investments may perform in a variety of market scenarios to help you be prepared for both up and down markets.



Q: Can I fund my retirement from investment income?

A: Many retirees would prefer to live off investment income to avoid depleting their assets over time. In practice, this can be difficult to do. For example, at a hypothetical 3% income rate, a $1,000,000 portfolio would generate only $30,000 per year, and that income could fluctuate unexpectedly. We can help you evaluate your options based on your situation.

Clients of independent investment advisors: You may also contact your advisor or call Schwab Alliance at 800-515-2157.1. Schwab reserves the right to act as principal on any bond transaction. In secondary market principal transactions, the price will be subject to our standard markup in the case of purchases and a markdown in the case of sales and may also include a profit or loss to Schwab in the form of a bid-ask spread. When trading as principal, Schwab may also be holding the security in its own account prior to selling it to you and, therefore, may make (or lose) money depending on whether the price of the security has risen or fallen while Schwab has held it. 

2. Conditions apply: Trades in ETFs available through Schwab ETF OneSource™ (including Schwab ETFs™) are available without commissions when placed online in a Schwab account. Service charges apply for trade orders placed through a broker ($25) or by automated phone ($5). An exchange-processing fee applies to sell transactions. Certain types of Schwab ETF OneSource transactions are not eligible for the commission waiver, such as short sells and buys to cover (not including Schwab ETFs). Schwab reserves the right to change the ETFs we make available without commissions. All ETFs are subject to management fees and expenses. Please see the Charles Schwab Pricing Guide for additional information. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. receives remuneration from third-party ETF companies participating in Schwab ETF OneSource for recordkeeping, shareholder services, and other administrative services, including program development and maintenance. 

3. Neither dividends nor growth of dividends is guaranteed. Stocks are subject to loss of principal. 

4. Annuity guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, not Schwab.

Single Premium Immediate Annuities
Enjoy guaranteed income for the rest of your life, starting today.1
If you’re looking for an "immediate" ongoing source of income that you can’t outlive, a single premium immediate annuity could be right for you. A single premium immediate annuity allows you to purchase a guaranteed1 paycheck that will continue for the rest of your life, and—if you’re married and you choose a joint life option—for the rest of your spouse’s life, no matter how long both of you live. This paycheck is designed to help cover your essential living expenses, as defined by you, in retirement.
Request assistance from a Schwab Annuity Specialist by calling 888-311-4889.

Payout Options


Brighthouse Income Annuity


Lifetime Income: Single life or joint life. This option provides income payments for the lifetimes of one or two people. For single life, payments stop at the annuitant’s death. For joint life, after the death of one person, the survivor will continue to receive 100% of the income payments for as long as he or she lives.
Lifetime Income with a Guarantee Period (5–30 Years): Single life or joint life. Income payments are provided for the lifetimes of one or two people and at least for the number of years specified, 5–30 years. After the death of one person, the survivor will continue to receive payments for as long as he or she lives. If both should die before the end of the stated number of years, the beneficiary(ies) will continue to receive payments for the remaining Guaranteed Period.
Income for a Guarantee Period Only (5–30 Years): Income payments continue for the number of years you choose, 5–30 years, and then they stop.  If you pass away before the end of the stated number of years, your beneficiary(ies) will continue to receive payments for the remaining Guaranteed Period.
Lifetime Income with a Cash Refund: Single life or joint life. Income payments will continue for the lifetimes of one or two people and last as long as either of you lives. If both of you should pass away before receiving your principal back, your beneficiary(ies) will receive a lump sum that equals your initial purchase payment less income payments you have already received.




Guardian Guaranteed Income Annuity III


Life Annuity without Guaranteed Period: Receive annuity payments for the life of the annuitant. Can be designated as a Joint Life Annuity with Survivor Benefit. Annuity payments continue until the death of the last surviving joint annuitant.
Life Annuity with Guaranteed Period: Receive annuity payments for the life of the annuitant. Can be designated as a Joint Life Annuity with Survivor Benefit. Annuity payments will continue until the death of the last surviving joint annuitant. Select any guaranteed period between 5 and 30 years (must be in full years). If the last surviving annuitant dies during the guaranteed period, annuity payments will continue to the owner until the end of the guaranteed period, or the owner can elect to receive the remaining annuity payments’ present-day value as a lump-sum distribution. If a lump-sum distribution is elected, annuity payments will end.  
Life Annuity with Refund Certain: Receive annuity payments for the life of the annuitant. Can be designated as a Joint Life Annuity with Survivor Benefit (must be 100% survivor benefit). Annuity payments will continue until the death of the last surviving joint annuitant.  If the annuitant dies before the owner has received total annuity payments equaling the net premium payment (initial premium adjusted for any applicable annuity tax), annuity payments continue until the owner receives the remaining amount guaranteed, or the owner can elect to receive the remaining amount guaranteed as a lump-sum distribution. If a lump-sum distribution is elected, annuity payments will end. 
Period Certain:  Receive annuity payments for a set amount of time between 5 and 30 years (must be in full years). If the annuitant dies during the period certain, annuity payments will continue to the owner until the end of the period certain, or the owner can elect to receive a present-day value lump-sum distribution of the remaining annuity payments. If a lump-sum is elected, annuity payments will end. 

See the Additional Features section for more information about Present-Day Value Lump-Sum Distribution.



MassMutual RetireEase

Payments stop at the annuitant’s death. The income payments go to the surviving annuitant upon the first death. All payments end upon the death of both annuitants.
Life with Period Certain: Single life or joint life. Payments will be made for a guaranteed period of time, 5–50 years,6 or for as long as either annuitant lives, whichever is longer. If both annuitants die prior to the end of the guaranteed period, the beneficiary will receive the remaining payments.
Period Certain Only: Single or joint. Payments will be made for a guaranteed period of time, 5–50 years.6 If both annuitants die prior to the end of the guaranteed period, the beneficiary will receive the remaining payments until the end of the period certain.
Life with Cash Refund: Single life or joint life. Payments will be made for as long as either annuitant lives. If the annuitant(s) die before the total amount of income payments received equals the single premium amount paid on the contract, the difference will be paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary.
Life with Installment Refund: Single life or joint life. Payments will be made for as long as one of two annuitants is alive. If both annuitants die before the total amount of income payments received equals the single premium amount paid, the difference will continue to be paid as scheduled income payments to the beneficiary.




Nationwide income Promise Select Annuity


Life Only: Single life or joint life. This option provides income payments for the lifetimes of one or two people. For single life, payments stop at the annuitant’s death. For joint life, after the death of one person, the survivor will continue to receive income payments for as long as he or she lives.
Life with Term Certain: Single life or joint life. This option provides guaranteed income for a period of time, 3–30 years, or for life, whichever is longer. If the annuitant (or both annuitants for a joint life policy) were to live beyond that period, payments would continue for the lifetime(s) of the annuitant(s). If the annuitant(s) die before the end of the term-certain period, the beneficiaries can choose to receive the remaining term payments (or a lump-sum payment that is equivalent to the present value of the remaining payments). If the annuitant(s) die after the term-certain period has ended, income payments stop with the annuitant(s) death.
Term Certain Only: Single or joint. This option provides guaranteed income for a period of time, 3–30 years. If the annuitant(s) die before the end of the term-certain period, the beneficiaries can choose to receive the remaining term payments or the present value of those payments in a lump sum.
Life with Cash Refund: Single life or joint life. This option provides income for the annuitant(s) until the total payments equal the original premium (minus any premium taxes) or for life, whichever is longer. If annuitant(s) die before the annuity payments equal the original premium, the beneficiaries will receive a lump-sum payment equal to the amount of the original premium that remains in the contract.




New York Life Guaranteed Lifetime Income Annuity II


Life Only: Generally provides maximum lifetime income for one person (or two people for a Joint Life Only policy). Payments stop at the annuitant’s death. For the Joint Life Only option, if one annuitant dies, the payments continue to the survivor for the rest of his or her life. Payments stop at the death of both annuitants.   
Life with Period Certain: Pays income for one lifetime (or two for a joint life policy) or a guaranteed period of time (5 to 30 years), whichever is longer. If the annuitant (or both annuitants for a joint life policy) were to live beyond that period, payments would continue for the lifetime(s) of the annuitant(s). If one (or both) were to die prior to the end of the guaranteed period, payments would continue to the beneficiaries for the remainder of the guaranteed period.7,8
Life with Cash Refund: Pays income for one lifetime (and the lifetime of one other person if a joint life policy). Additionally, this option guarantees that if the annuitant(s) die, the beneficiaries will receive a lump sum equaling the premium amount less all payments made to the annuitant(s).9 For Joint Life policies, this option is available only if the survivor’s income is 100% of the income benefit while both annuitants are alive.
Life with Installment Refund: Pays income for one lifetime (and the lifetime of one other person if a joint life policy). Additionally, this option guarantees that if the annuitants die, the beneficiaries will continue to receive the annuity payments until the premium is fully recovered. The Installment Refund provision entitles the beneficiaries to receive the total of the premium less all payments made on a scheduled installment basis.7,9
Life with Percent of Premium Death Benefit:10 Offers income for one lifetime (and the lifetime of one other person if a joint life policy). It also guarantees that when the annuitant dies (or both annuitants for a joint life policy), the beneficiaries will receive a death benefit totaling 25% or 50% of the original premium (chosen at policy issue). This alternative pays a lower income for the same premium than one that does not provide a guaranteed death benefit, but it ensures a legacy for the policy owner’s heirs.




New York Life Guaranteed Period Income Annuity II


Period Certain with Cash Refund (Commuted Value):11 Pays income for a guaranteed period of time (5 to 30 years). Upon the annuitant’s death prior to the end of the guaranteed period, payments would continue to the beneficiaries for the remainder of the guaranteed period, or the beneficiaries will receive a lump sum.

Single premium immediate annuity: frequently asked questions.
What are single premium immediate annuities?
Single premium immediate annuities may create a guaranteed1 income stream for life—or for a specific period of time that you choose—to help cover some or all of your expenses in retirement. For an additional cost, single premium immediate annuities may also offer a cost-of-living adjustment, increasing your income each year, to help address inflation risk.
Would a single premium immediate annuity be a good option for me?
A single premium immediate annuity may be a good option for you if you do not have sufficient guaranteed income (for example, a pension or Social Security) to cover your essential living expenses in retirement. In addition, if you are concerned about outliving your retirement assets, a single premium immediate annuity can help alleviate that concern.
What should I be aware of?

A single premium immediate annuity will generally cost more if you choose the optional features or optional death benefits. Additionally, the purchase of a single premium annuity is irrevocable. That is, you generally cannot surrender this type of annuity in exchange for a contract value. 
Payments from single premium immediate annuities are subject to ordinary income tax, but for non-qualified policies that benefit from an exclusion ratio, a portion of your payments may not be subject to further taxation.
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuity might fit your retirement strategy. 

What information does the Income Annuity Estimator provide?
The Income Annuity Estimator provides an annuity income estimate in a few simple steps.†
How do I use the Income Annuity Estimator?

There are three simple steps once you’re on the Income Annuity Estimator page:

In the “Enter Annuity Information” section, select how long you would like your income to last (i.e., for your lifetime or a set period of time), when you want income to begin (i.e. within 12 months for a single premium immediate annuity) and enter the figure (i.e., either the amount you plan to invest or the monthly income you’ll need) you would like your estimate to be based on.
Enter your date of birth, gender, and state of residence. 
View and print your results.

Be sure to contact your Schwab Financial Consultant or call 888-311-4889 to speak with a Schwab Annuity Specialist to determine if a single premium immediate annuity would fit your retirement income strategy.

Annuity Frequently Asked Questions


What is an annuity?


Annuities are contracts between you and an insurance company that can provide you income through a unique combination of investment and insurance features. Annuities can complement other retirement plans and, depending on what type you select, they may provide guaranteed lifetime income, opportunities for tax-deferred growth, flexible withdrawals, and legacy protection for your beneficiaries. Guarantees subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. 




How do annuities work?


When purchasing an income annuity your assets become a guaranteed income stream for life, or for a specific period of time. Many clients purchase income annuities to cover their essential expenses, as defined by them, in retirement. For an additional cost, income annuities may offer a cost-of-living-adjustment, increasing your income each year, to help address inflation risk. 

Charles Schwab offers two types of income annuities: Single premium immediate annuities and deferred income annuities. The key difference between these two product types is when income begins. For single premium immediate annuities income generally begins “immediately”, whereas deferred income annuities, the income doesn't begin for at least 13 months from your last premium payment, but may be deferred by up to 40 years.
Fixed annuities, sometimes referred to as fixed deferred annuities, provide guaranteed asset growth at a fixed rate for a specific time period. The growth is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more assets instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase, and your assets are protected from market uncertainty. If you elect to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or for a specific time period. 
Fixed indexed annuities provide principal protection with the option for fixed rate returns (similar to a fixed annuity), or capped growth dependent on a preselected market index over a specific period of time – you are not directly invested in the market. If the index is up then yield is credited to your account up to a capped percentage. If the index is down then your principal will not lose value (i.e. 0% return). The growth is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more assets instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase. If you elect to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or a specific time period.
With a variable annuity, investments, often called sub-accounts, are chosen from within the annuity. The performance of the investments determines the value of the account and subsequently, the amount of income you will receive. The growth of the investments is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more, instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase. If you elect to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or for a specific time period. 




What is the difference between fixed, fixed indexed, and variable annuities?


A fixed annuity provides principal protection with the stability of a fixed, guaranteed rate of return. Fixed indexed annuities offer principal protection with the opportunity to earn an attractive capped rate of return based a preselected market index, and you are not directly invested in the market. Variable annuities do not offer principal protection, but offer the potential for uncapped growth with a chance to participate in the market through a variety of professionally managed portfolios. Guarantees subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.




What kinds of annuities does Charles Schwab offer?


Charles Schwab offers income annuities (single premium immediate annuities and deferred income annuities), fixed deferred annuities, fixed indexed annuities and low cost variable annuities1. The fixed indexed annuities and variable annuities offer an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB).
Income annuities provide guaranteed lifetime income or income for a specific period of time that you choose. A single premium immediate annuity provides income “immediately.” A deferred income annuity provides income at a future date that you select.
Fixed deferred annuities deliver guaranteed growth and principal protection of your assets.
Fixed indexed annuities may provide (a) principal protection of your assets, (b) market capped growth, (c) guaranteed lifetime income, (d) guaranteed death benefit options, and (e) tax-deferred growth potential. 

Low-cost variable annuities1 may provide (a) guaranteed lifetime income, (b) guaranteed death benefit options, (c) a variety of investment options, and (d) tax-deferred growth potential.




When might an annuity be a good option for your situation?


Depending on your needs, annuities may be a good addition to your financial plan.

Income annuities may be a fit if you're seeking a guaranteed, steady stream of income you can't outlive. The guaranteed lifetime income may help cover essential expenses in retirement, as defined by you, regardless of how long you live. If you need income "immediately", a single premium immediate annuity may be right for you. If you need income in the future, a deferred income annuity may be more appropriate. 

A fixed deferred annuity may be a good fit if you are looking for guaranteed growth, principal protection, and have other funds for near-term (at least three-years) liquidity needs.

Fixed indexed annuities allow you to protect your principal with the opportunity to generate market capped growth, and may provide protection of lifetime income for you and your spouse with an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit3, available for an additional cost. Additionally, fixed indexed annuities provide the potential for tax-deferred investment growth, and, with an optional death benefit, may provide you with the confidence in knowing your assets are protected for your beneficiaries4. 

Low-cost variable annuities1 through Schwab offer the ability to withdraw your assets at any time without surrender charges2, and may provide protection of lifetime income for you and your spouse with an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit3, available for an additional cost. Additionally, variable annuities provide the potential for tax-deferred investment growth, and, with an optional death benefit, may provide you with the confidence in knowing your assets are protected for your beneficiaries4. 

A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuities would fit your financial plan. If you already have an annuity and feel it may not be meeting your current needs, a Schwab Financial Consultant can perform an analysis to determine whether it may make sense to exchange your current annuity to one at Schwab. 

Before deciding to replace your existing contract, however, please consider any surrender charges on your existing contract; possible loss of guaranteed benefits; differences in features, costs, services, and company strength; and other factors which could reduce or eliminate the benefit of the exchange.




What should I be aware of?


Annuity fees will vary depending on the product. Typically you will see insurance charges (pays for the guarantees that the insurance company provides), surrender charges (charges on an early withdrawal based on the time period of the policy or cancellation of the policy), investment fees (pays for the management of the underlying investment options), and fees for optional living benefits or optional death benefits.  
Withdrawals from an annuity will reduce the value of your annuity, and withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax. Also, note that withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty. 
The performance of the underlying investment options are subject to market fluctuation and are not guaranteed. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuities may fit your retirement strategy.




How are annuities taxed?


Annuity earnings are tax-deferred during the accumulation phase, which means you do not pay taxes on any earnings each year; you pay taxes on earnings only when you withdraw your money. Any withdrawals of taxable amounts are taxed as ordinary income, and you may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty if you take them before age 59½. 




How do annuities compare to other retirement options?


Charles Schwab offers various financial tools to help you with your retirement and planning. Work with your Financial Consultant to determine which product or products are a good fit for you.




How might annuities benefit my heirs?


Many annuities have death benefits and optional death benefits. Optional death benefits are available for an additional cost. 
An account value death benefit will provide your beneficiaries the amount of your remaining contract value, if any. 
A return of premium or purchase payments death benefit provides your beneficiaries with the greater of the account value or the total premium payments less withdrawals. Premium taxes may apply. 
A stepped-up death benefit offers you the potential to lock in market gains for your beneficiaries. Adjustments are made for additional premium payments and withdrawals. 

A roll-up death benefit guarantees an annual growth rate credited to your contract for your beneficiaries. Adjustments are made for additional premium payments or withdrawals.




What goes into getting an annuity?


A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuities may fit your retirement strategy.

As you transition into retirement, you'll likely need to make some adjustments to your retirement portfolio.What's the right mix of investments for you?Stocks can be volatile, offering greater risks and rewards. Cash and fixed income tend to be safer bets, providing more modest returns. While it’s generally recommended that you take on a more conservative investing approach as you reach retirement, it will depend on your own unique circumstances and tolerance for risk. Use our asset allocation models as guidelines to help you balance your need for income and growth.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Example is for illustrative purposes only.1. Sample Allocation Portfolios 
Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. The return figures are the average, the maximum, and the minimum annual returns of hypothetical asset allocation plans. The asset allocation plans are weighted averages of the performance of the indices used to represent each asset class in the plans and are rebalanced annually. The Conservative allocation is composed of 20% stocks (15% large-cap stocks, 5% international stocks), 50% bonds, and 30% cash. The Moderately Conservative allocation is composed of 40% stocks (25% large-cap stocks, 5% small-cap stocks, 10% international stocks), 50% bonds, and 10% cash. The Moderate allocation is composed of 60% stocks (35% large-cap stocks, 10% small-cap stocks, 15% international stocks), 35% bonds, and 5% cash. The indices representing each asset class in the asset allocation plan are S&P 500® Index (large-cap stocks); Russell 2000® Index (small-cap stocks); MSCI EAFE® net of taxes (international stocks); Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (bonds); and Citigroup U.S. 3-month Treasury bills (cash).

CRSP 6-8 was used for small-cap stocks prior to 1979, Ibbotson Intermediate-Term U.S. Government Bond Index was used for bonds prior to 1976, and Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury bills was used prior to 1978. Results assume reinvestment of dividends and interest. Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested directly. Past performance is no indication of future results. For more information on the methodology for the long-term return estimate calculations, see Market Insight article “Q&A: Estimating Long-Term Market Returns.”The information here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered an individualized recommendation or personalized investment advice. The investment strategies mentioned here may not be suitable for everyone. Each investor needs to review an investment strategy for his or her own particular situation before making any investment decision.

Examples provided are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to be reflective of results you can expect to achieve.

What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

The GLWB option allows you to lock in an annual retirement income equal to 5% of your contract's highest anniversary value for the single life rider (4.5% for the joint life rider) on any contract anniversary date after you purchased the rider. You can add the GLWB option on or after the date you purchase your annuity until age 85.

Hypothetical contract valueSingle life rider illustration

Protected Payment BaseYour Protected Payment Base equals your initial purchase payment if added at contract issue, or the value of your annuity contract on the date you add the GLWB. It can continue to step up to the highest  contract value on any subsequent contract anniversary date (the date you purchased the annuity), but never steps back down due to market performance. Note: The Protected Payment Base is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. Your actual contract value and death benefit will decrease with each withdrawal. 


Guaranteed lifetime incomeYou can decide to start income withdrawals at any time after age 653—equal to 5% of your highest Protected Payment Base for the single life rider or 4.5% for the joint life rider.1 Your income withdrawals can even increase if your contract value rises and reaches a higher Protected Payment Base, but they won’t decrease if your contract value falls.


Upside potentialIf your contract value is higher on your contract anniversary date, your Protected Payment Base is stepped up and locked in at the higher value.

When you purchase the GLWB, your Protected Payment Base is established and locked against market downturns. 
Downside protectionBecause your Protected Payment Base is the highest value your contract reaches on any contract anniversary date after the GLWB option is purchased, it is locked and protected against market losses.
Guaranteed lifetime incomeWhen you begin taking income after reaching age 65, you can receive 5% of your locked-in Protected Payment Base for life (4.5% for joint life rider)—even if market volatility, income withdrawals, and annuity fees reduce your contract value to zero.
Protected Payment Base x 5% for the Single Life Rider = Annual Income
Note: The Protected Payment Base is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. Your actual contract value and death benefit will decrease with each withdrawal.

When a variable annuity with a GLWB may make the most sense.Retirement income planning is like a puzzle with many pieces. How those pieces fit together for you—and whether a variable annuity with a GLWB is an appropriate addition—will depend on your own personal situation: 

You're within 10 years of retirement. 
You believe you may live at least 20 more years once you begin making income withdrawals. 
You have sufficient savings available for unexpected expenses, reducing the likelihood that you would need to make an unexpected excess withdrawal from your annuity. 
Social Security and other predictable income may not be enough to cover essential expenses.
A potential solution for Bill and Mary. Read how an annuity could be used to cover essential expenses for a couple who is retiring soon.

1. The Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) is an optional rider available for an additional cost charged against the Protected Payment Base. After age 65, you may withdraw your Protected Payment Amount for life (5% for single life rider and 4.5% for joint life rider) even after the account value has been depleted to zero. The Protected Payment Base is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. Please see the prospectus for additional details. Withdrawals in excess of the percentage limits in any year could significantly and permanently reduce all future withdrawal amounts. GLWB withdrawals are not annuity payouts. Annuity payouts generally receive a more favorable tax treatment than other withdrawals. 2. Source: Base annuity fee of 0.60%, as compared to the industry average of 1.32% according to a February 16, 2017 Morningstar survey of 2,192 variable annuities. This does not include fees associated with the optional GLWB or underlying investment options or fees associated with optional death benefits. The GLWB currently carries a fee of 0.80% (individual life) to 1.00% (joint life), and underlying investment options carry additional fees and expenses of 0.68% after expense reductions. Optional death benefit fees are 0.20% for Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit and 0.40% for the Stepped-Up Death Benefit.

3. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal  tax penalty, in addition to applicable income taxes. For non-qualified contracts, an additional 3.8% tax may apply on net investment income.

4. Optional death benefits are not available if you have selected the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) and you will be unable to elect the GLWB at a later date if you select an optional death benefit.5. When you invest in a variable annuity, you do not invest directly in the portfolios. You invest in sub-accounts that, in turn, invest in the portfolios you’ve selected. Your account is then credited with variable accumulation units in that sub-account. The fees and charges associated with the sub-accounts and the terms and conditions of your investments are detailed in the prospectus and are in addition to the fees for the variable annuity and optional GLWB rider or other riders. 6. Exposure to the asset classes is achieved through investments in ETFs and mutual funds, not through direct investment in the assets. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Some specialized ETFs can be subject to additional market risks. Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility such that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. 7. For illustrative purposes only. As of May 1, 2017, the total annual operating expenses for the Schwab VIT Portfolios ranged from 0.61% to 0.68%. The investment adviser and its affiliates have agreed to limit the total annual portfolio operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, and certain non-routine expenses) of the portfolio to 0.58% for so long as the investment adviser serves as adviser to the portfolio. This agreement is limited to the portfolio’s direct operating expenses and does not apply to acquired fund fees and expenses (AFFE). This agreement may only be amended or terminated with the approval of the portfolio’s board of trustees. 

8. Subject to increase up to a maximum 1.50% for individual life and 1.75% for joint life.

The contract value of the annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid, and it is possible to lose money.

Variable annuities are long term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals of taxable amounts will be subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% tax penalty. Withdrawals will reduce the death benefit amount in direct proportion to the percentage by which the contract value was reduced. This can increase or decrease the amount deducted from the death benefit.

Annual guaranteed income8
Beginning at age 65 you can receive 5% of the Protected Payment Base for the single life rider and 4.5% for the joint life rider.
Beginning as early as age 59½
, you can begin receiving annual withdrawals ranging from 3.5-6.5% of the Benefit Base depending on age and single or joint life. See details.


The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits referenced above are optional riders for which you will incur an additional charge, as shown above. The Protected Payment/Benefit Base on which the guaranteed lifetime income is based is not a contract value, cannot be accessed like a cash value, and cannot be left to your beneficiaries as a death benefit. Additionally, a GLWB will not preserve your contract value, which will decrease with each withdrawal until it reaches zero, although payments under the terms of the rider will still continue for life. Restrictions and limitations apply. See the prospectus for details. 


Death benefit 
 
 


Return of account value
Beneficiaries receive any remaining contract value, less premium taxes prior to annuitization.
Beneficiaries receive current account value (less premium taxes). Available for those age 85 or under at time of purchase.


Optional death benefits
 If protecting your beneficiaries is a priority, you can purchase one of two optional death benefits for an additional fee at the time you purchase the annuity. These optional death benefits are available for purchase to owners and annuitants 75 years or younger. Cannot be combined with the GLWB option.
The Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit provides your beneficiaries with the greater of the contract value or the total of purchase payments, adjusted for withdrawals prior to annuitization. 
Additional cost 0.20%  
The Stepped-Up Death Benefit offers you the potential to lock in market gains for your beneficiaries. Additional cost 0.40% 



Beneficiaries receive total contributions (less the proportional impact of any distributions, withdrawals, and premium taxes) or the contract value (less premium taxes), whichever is greater. Available for those age 80 or under at time of purchase. Additional cost 0.20%.

Annuity Frequently Asked Questions

What is a variable annuity?


A variable annuity is a long-term investment for retirement that can provide guaranteed lifetime income, may have guaranteed death benefit options, has a variety of investment options, and provides tax-deferred growth potential. Many variable annuities also offer an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB), for an additional cost, that provides protection of lifetime guaranteed income for you and your spouse. Variable annuities with an optional death benefit can provide you with the confidence in knowing your assets are protected for your beneficiaries for an additional cost. 
Note:  A GLWB is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. The actual contract value will deplete with each withdrawal. 




What might make a variable annuity a good option for your situation?


Variable annuities offer benefits that can help you reach your retirement goals and maintain your standard of living when retired. The income from these types of annuities can provide regular income for years, or even for life. 





What potential drawbacks should I be aware of?


For variable annuities you will typically see insurance charges (pays for the guarantees that the insurance company provides), surrender charges (charge on an early withdrawal based on a the time period of the policy or cancellation of the policy), investment fees (pays for the management of the underlying investment options), and fees for optional living benefits or optional death benefits (fees that pay for the guarantees that the optional benefits provide). Variable annuities offered by Charles Schwab do not have surrender charges.  
Withdrawals from an annuity will reduce the value of your annuity, and withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty. 
The performance of the underlying investment options is subject to market fluctuation and are not guaranteed. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuity might fit your retirement strategy.




Are variable annuities right for me?


If you are seeking the potential for asset growth before retirement with income protection and guaranteed lifetime income in retirement, variable annuities could be right for you. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuity might fit your retirement strategy. 




What does the annuity calculator do?


The Variable Annuity Expense Calculator helps you determine how much you might be able to save in fees by exchanging your current variable annuity to a Charles Schwab low-cost variable annuity1: Schwab Retirement Income Variable Annuity® and Schwab OneSource Choice Variable Annuity™. Use this calculator to get an idea about whether an exchange might be in your best interest, then for a more comprehensive assessment, talk with a Schwab consultant at your local branch. To speak with a Schwab annuity consultant, call 888-311-4889. 
When considering an exchange, expenses are only one factor. Before replacing your current annuity, please also consider surrender charges on your existing contract, the potential loss of any guaranteed benefits, and differences in features, costs, services, and company strength as well as factors that could reduce or eliminate the benefit of the exchange.




How do I use the calculator?


There are three simple steps once you're on the Variable Annuity Expense Calculator page:

Enter your existing annuity either by the annuity name or the insurance company. 
Select a Schwab Annuity. 
Analyze your expenses.
Be sure to contact your Schwab consultant or call 888-311-4889 to speak with a licensed annuity specialist about whether you might benefit from a tax-free exchange.

Protected Payment BaseYour Protected Payment Base equals your initial purchase payment if added at contract issue, or the value of your annuity contract on the date you add the GLWB. It can continue to step up to the highest  contract value on any subsequent contract anniversary date (the date you purchased the annuity), but never steps back down due to market performance. Note: The Protected Payment Base is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. Your actual contract value and death benefit will decrease with each withdrawal. 


Guaranteed lifetime incomeYou can decide to start income withdrawals at any time after age 653—equal to 5% of your highest Protected Payment Base for the single life rider or 4.5% for the joint life rider.1 Your income withdrawals can even increase if your contract value rises and reaches a higher Protected Payment Base, but they won’t decrease if your contract value falls.

When a variable annuity with a GLWB may make the most sense.Retirement income planning is like a puzzle with many pieces. How those pieces fit together for you—and whether a variable annuity with a GLWB is an appropriate addition—will depend on your own personal situation: 

You're within 10 years of retirement. 
You believe you may live at least 20 more years once you begin making income withdrawals. 
You have sufficient savings available for unexpected expenses, reducing the likelihood that you would need to make an unexpected excess withdrawal from your annuity. 
Social Security and other predictable income may not be enough to cover essential expenses.
A potential solution for Bill and Mary. Read how an annuity could be used to cover essential expenses for a couple who is retiring soon.

1. The Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) is an optional rider available for an additional cost charged against the Protected Payment Base. After age 65, you may withdraw your Protected Payment Amount for life (5% for single life rider and 4.5% for joint life rider) even after the account value has been depleted to zero. The Protected Payment Base is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. Please see the prospectus for additional details. Withdrawals in excess of the percentage limits in any year could significantly and permanently reduce all future withdrawal amounts. GLWB withdrawals are not annuity payouts. Annuity payouts generally receive a more favorable tax treatment than other withdrawals. 2. Source: Base annuity fee of 0.60%, as compared to the industry average of 1.32% according to a February 16, 2017 Morningstar survey of 2,192 variable annuities. This does not include fees associated with the optional GLWB or underlying investment options or fees associated with optional death benefits. The GLWB currently carries a fee of 0.80% (individual life) to 1.00% (joint life), and underlying investment options carry additional fees and expenses of 0.68% after expense reductions. Optional death benefit fees are 0.20% for Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit and 0.40% for the Stepped-Up Death Benefit.

3. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal  tax penalty, in addition to applicable income taxes. For non-qualified contracts, an additional 3.8% tax may apply on net investment income.

4. Optional death benefits are not available if you have selected the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) and you will be unable to elect the GLWB at a later date if you select an optional death benefit.5. When you invest in a variable annuity, you do not invest directly in the portfolios. You invest in sub-accounts that, in turn, invest in the portfolios you’ve selected. Your account is then credited with variable accumulation units in that sub-account. The fees and charges associated with the sub-accounts and the terms and conditions of your investments are detailed in the prospectus and are in addition to the fees for the variable annuity and optional GLWB rider or other riders. 6. Exposure to the asset classes is achieved through investments in ETFs and mutual funds, not through direct investment in the assets. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Some specialized ETFs can be subject to additional market risks. Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility such that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. 7. For illustrative purposes only. As of May 1, 2017, the total annual operating expenses for the Schwab VIT Portfolios ranged from 0.61% to 0.68%. The investment adviser and its affiliates have agreed to limit the total annual portfolio operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, and certain non-routine expenses) of the portfolio to 0.58% for so long as the investment adviser serves as adviser to the portfolio. This agreement is limited to the portfolio’s direct operating expenses and does not apply to acquired fund fees and expenses (AFFE). This agreement may only be amended or terminated with the approval of the portfolio’s board of trustees. 

8. Subject to increase up to a maximum 1.50% for individual life and 1.75% for joint life.

(“Schwab”) through its representatives, including both employees and independent contractors and their employees (“Schwab Financial Consultants”). Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (“CSIM”) is the adviser for the underlying investment options. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation and are not affiliated with Pacific Life Insurance Company or Pacific Life & Annuity Company. 

Pacific Life is a product provider. It is not a fiduciary and therefore does not give advice or make recommendations regarding insurance or investment products. Only a financial consultant can advise if the product purchase and any subsequent action taken with regard to the product are in the client’s best interest.

The contract value of the annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid, and it is possible to lose money.

Variable annuities are long term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals of taxable amounts will be subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% tax penalty. Withdrawals will reduce the death benefit amount in direct proportion to the percentage by which the contract value was reduced. This can increase or decrease the amount deducted from the death benefit. 

Pacific Life refers to Pacific Life Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Insurance products are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Company in all states except New York, and are issued in New York by Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Product availability and features may vary by state. Each insurance company is solely responsible for the financial obligations accruing under the products it issues.

Fixed deferred annuity frequently asked questions
What are fixed deferred annuities?
Fixed deferred annuities provide guaranteed asset growth at a fixed rate for a specific time period. The growth is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more assets instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase, and your assets are protected from market uncertainty. If you choose to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or for a specific time period.
When might fixed deferred annuities be a good option for your situation?
If you have a portion of investable assets that you are not willing to lose any principal on, and you don't anticipate needing to access the funds for a number of years, then a FDA might be a good fit in your portfolio.
What should I be aware of?

Fixed deferred annuities can also have surrender charges (a charge on an early withdrawal based on the time period of the policy or cancellation of the policy) and some contracts may impose a market value adjustment if you make a withdrawal during one or more of the guaranteed periods you can elect under the policy. Generally, any withdrawals in a given year that exceed 10% of your account value will be subject to surrender charges and/or a market value adjustment.
Withdrawals from a fixed deferred annuity will reduce the value of your annuity and can be subject to ordinary income tax. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may also be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuity might fit your retirement strategy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Variable Annuity Expense Analyzer
Find out how much you might save by exchanging your current variable annuity for a low-cost Schwab annuity1. Use this calculator to get an idea about whether an exchange might be in your best interest, then for a more comprehensive assessment, talk with a Schwab consultant at your local branch. To speak with a Schwab annuity consultant, call 888-745-9679. 

There are a number of factors that must be considered before exchanging an existing contract. Among them are the surrender charges on the existing contract, potential loss of accrued living and death benefits, transaction costs associated with the exchange, the values of the new contract versus the old contract and the differences in features, costs, charges and expenses, services and company strength. You should also consider potential tax consequences. You should only consider initiating an exchange after carefully evaluating these factors and reviewing your existing contract.

More Information
To learn more about the Schwab Retirement Income Variable AnnuityTM, visit www.schwab.com/annuities or speak with a Financial Consultant or registered representative2  at your local Schwab branch.





 
(1) Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, and do not apply to the separate account or the underlying portfolios available with this contract. Schwab does not provide any of the insurance guarantees. Please note, only one optional death benefit may be elected per contract.
(2) Schwab Financial Consultants are registered representatives of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., which includes financial consultants, independent branch contractors or employees.




The Schwab Retirement Income Variable Annuity may not be available in all states and is a registered security that is sold by prospectuses only, and may be suitable for long-term goals such as retirement. The prospectus contains details on sub-accounts, contract features, fees, expenses and other pertinent information. The product prospectus is available on this web site see "Prospectus" links.

The Schwab Retirement Income Variable Annuity™ is a flexible purchase payments variable deferred annuity issued by Pacific Life. This variable annuity is sold exclusively by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”) through its representatives, including both employees and independent contractors and their employees (“Schwab Financial Consultants”). Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM) is the investment adviser for the underlying investment portfolios. Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc and Charles Schwab & Co. Inc. are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation. These entities are not affiliated with Pacific Life or Pacific Select Distributors, LLC.

Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. You can request a prospectus by calling (888) 311-4889 (option 2) or by visiting schwab.com/annuity. Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully read the prospectus and consider the annuity's investment objectives and all risks, charges, and expenses associated with the annuity and its investment options.

Annuity withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts, including death benefit payouts, will be subject to ordinary income tax. For nonqualified contracts, an additional 3.8% federal tax may apply on net investment income. If withdrawals and other distributions are taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of the death benefits, and also may reduce the value of any optional benefits.

The value of the variable investment options will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.

IRAs and qualified plans—such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s—are already tax-deferred. Therefore, a deferred annuity should be used only to fund an IRA or qualified plan to benefit from the annuity's features other than tax deferral. These include lifetime income, death benefit options, and the ability to transfer among investment options without sales or withdrawal charges.

The Schwab Retirement Income Variable Annuity™ is distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company (Newport Beach, CA) and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Variable and fixed annuity products are available through licensed third parties. All individuals selling these products must be licensed insurance agent and registered representatives.
