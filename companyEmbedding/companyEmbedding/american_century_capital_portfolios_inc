Diversification does not assure a profit nor does it protect against loss of principal.





Certificates of deposit (CDs) offered through American Century Brokerage are issued by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured institutions, and are subject to change and availability. There is a $55 early termination fee and possible market value adjustments. Brokered CDs will fluctuate in market value between purchase date and maturity date due to their ability to be sold on the secondary market. Because the secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid, a significant loss of principal could result if your CD is sold prior to maturity. American Century Brokerage makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution and does not endorse or recommend the CDs in any way.





Brokerage Services are provided by American Century Brokerage, a division of American Century Investment Services, Inc., registered broker/dealer, member FINRA, SIPC.

Data reflects past performance, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than data shown. Investment return and principal value fluctuates. Redemption value may be more or less than original cost. Obtain performance data current to the most recent month end. Extraordinary performance is attributable in part to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.

A

Average annual total returns illustrate the annual compounded returns that would have produced the cumulative total return if the fund's performance had remained constant throughout the period indicated. Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.



B

Please see the prospectus for details about sales charges.



C

Expense ratios provided are the funds' total annual operating expense ratios, gross of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements. Expense ratios are as of the funds' most current prospectus.





Returns or yields for the fund would have been lower if .01% of the management fee had not been waived. The advisor expects this waiver to continue until April 30, 2018, and cannot terminate it prior to such date without the approval of the Board of Directors. Review the annual or semiannual report for the most current information.





For periods prior to the inception of a class, performance is for the oldest class, restated with applicable fees, if any.

The value and/or returns of a portfolio will fluctuate with market and economic conditions.
Historically, small- and/or mid-cap stocks have been more volatile than the stock of larger, more-established companies. Smaller companies may have limited resources, product lines and markets, and their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than the securities of larger companies.
