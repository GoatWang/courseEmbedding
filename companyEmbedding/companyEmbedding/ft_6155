Home of the Secret Society of Smoked Mullet, what?

                    Englewood is a shared community, shared by Charlotte County and Sarasota County in Florida.   This picturesque little town is the gateway to Charlotte Counties beautiful pristine Beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. You have not lived until you jump into the beautiful green/blue water of the Gulf and watch dolphins, manatees and even manta rays swimming by you  (Don't touch them please, our nature friends are very sensitive)   The string of beaches include Stump Pass Beach, Englewood Beach,  Blind Pass--to us locals, that would be middle beach--and Manasota Beach.   I think Dr. Beach has never named any of our beaches on the top ten list, because he wants to keep them a secret to himself!!!  Who knows, I could be right about that!   

Oh, by the way, The Secret Society of The Smoked Mullets was started in 1996 when Englewood Florida Chamber President Nita Edmondson (Cole) was looking for a special recognition award for those in the Englewood community who had contributed to the area's successes, but may never have been recognized.  The name originated from Englewood's famous dish: the smoked mullet. Historical tales say when the mullet ran in Lemon Bay in the early days, they literally jumped into the rowboats, and "got tangled up in the ladies petticoats."  Anyone can be nominated, but past generations are given priority. Only the past winners can bring the names to the nomination meeting, and vote for the winners.  It's a lifetime honor to be chosen. Membership does not expire. (source, Englewood Chamber of Commerce)

                    Englewood still has the old Florida charm.  I love the drive down North Beach Road on Manasota Key.  Check out the shops on Dearborn Street and then watch the sun go down from the Lock & Key across from Chadwick Park on Englewood Beach.  I always feel relaxed in this coastal town.

The Model 3640 is designed to reject high levels of interference. It can be used under difficult conditions such as high stray currents that normally affect accuracy. The Model 3640 may be used to perform the following tests:   Three-Point measurements for measuring resistance to ground of ground rods and grids. Three-Point measurements are generally used when the electrode or grid is easily disconnected, if corrosion is suspected, or where ground faults are unlikely to occur.  Two-Point tests for continuity on bonding or on pre-established grounds. This test is commonly performed in urban environments where proper auxiliary electrode placement may be obscured by confined real estate. Measurements are referenced against a good local ground conductor.

County Water! Fantastic opportunity to build your new home in the awesome community of Gulf Cove. This oversized lot gives you that little extra elbow room you want with out having to buy a second lot. That translates into less time mowing you grass and more time on your boat! The voluntary HOA fee not only helps to keep the park area a beautiful place for family and guests to spend time but also gives you access to the community boat ramp. At only $50 a year that's not only a huge deal but why would you rather trailer your boat to a public ramp and deal with that aggravation? Come check us out and see why they who are in the know, know they love it here!

                    Port Charlotte, Florida is situated around one of my favorite places,  Charlotte Harbor, Florida's second-largest estuary system. The  unspoiled beauty and its livability, making it a destination of choice for both full-time residents and vacationers is what Port Charlotte/Charlotte County Florida is all about.

In spite of a growth explosion in recent years, Charlotte County has remained a delightful place to live, work and vacation.

The Greater Port Charlotte area has so much to offer from schooling, art, symphonies, fishing, golfing, boating, major league baseball spring training, and much, much more.   The area just provides a beautiful environment to live in.   There is something for everyone

One of the biggest plus of living in Florida is our unique wildlife.  If you love nature, which includes alligators, coyotes, foxes, panthers, bobcats, bears, great blue heron, dolphins (those beautiful creatures that they are), then look no further.  This is the place for you.
