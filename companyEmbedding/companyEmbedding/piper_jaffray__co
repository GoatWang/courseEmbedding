History[edit]
Piper Jaffray traces its roots to 1895 when George Lane established George B. Lane, Commercial Paper and Collateral Loans & Co., a commercial paper brokerage, in Minneapolis. In 1913, Piper, Jaffray Co. was established as another commercial paper business by H.C. Piper Sr. and Clive Palmer (C.P. or Palmer) Jaffray. In 1917, George B. Lane & Co. merged with Piper, Jaffray & Co. to form Lane, Piper & Jaffray.[4]
The firm first obtained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1931 with the acquisition of Hopwood & Company, which had been devastated by the stock market crash. In 1971, Piper first offered stock to the public and became a publicly held corporation known as Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Incorporated. Later, in 1986, Piper's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PIPR. In 1997, the firm was acquired by U.S. Bancorp, also based in Minneapolis, for $730 million in cash. From 1999 to 2003, the firm was known as U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In 2003, U.S. Bancorp spun off Piper Jaffray[5] in a stock dividend to its shareholders, making the company independent once again under the symbol PJC.

History[edit]
Piper Jaffray traces its roots to 1895 when George Lane established George B. Lane, Commercial Paper and Collateral Loans & Co., a commercial paper brokerage, in Minneapolis. In 1913, Piper, Jaffray Co. was established as another commercial paper business by H.C. Piper Sr. and Clive Palmer (C.P. or Palmer) Jaffray. In 1917, George B. Lane & Co. merged with Piper, Jaffray & Co. to form Lane, Piper & Jaffray.[4]
The firm first obtained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1931 with the acquisition of Hopwood & Company, which had been devastated by the stock market crash. In 1971, Piper first offered stock to the public and became a publicly held corporation known as Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Incorporated. Later, in 1986, Piper's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PIPR. In 1997, the firm was acquired by U.S. Bancorp, also based in Minneapolis, for $730 million in cash. From 1999 to 2003, the firm was known as U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In 2003, U.S. Bancorp spun off Piper Jaffray[5] in a stock dividend to its shareholders, making the company independent once again under the symbol PJC. In 2006, the company sold its brokerage business to Zurich-based UBS for $510 million in cash.[6] The business had approximately 800 brokers at that time.

History[edit]
Piper Jaffray traces its roots to 1895 when George Lane established George B. Lane, Commercial Paper and Collateral Loans & Co., a commercial paper brokerage, in Minneapolis. In 1913, Piper, Jaffray Co. was established as another commercial paper business by H.C. Piper Sr. and Clive Palmer (C.P. or Palmer) Jaffray. In 1917, George B. Lane & Co. merged with Piper, Jaffray & Co. to form Lane, Piper & Jaffray.[4]
The firm first obtained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1931 with the acquisition of Hopwood & Company, which had been devastated by the stock market crash. In 1971, Piper first offered stock to the public and became a publicly held corporation known as Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Incorporated. Later, in 1986, Piper's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PIPR. In 1997, the firm was acquired by U.S. Bancorp, also based in Minneapolis, for $730 million in cash. From 1999 to 2003, the firm was known as U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In 2003, U.S. Bancorp spun off Piper Jaffray[5] in a stock dividend to its shareholders, making the company independent once again under the symbol PJC. In 2006, the company sold its brokerage business to Zurich-based UBS for $510 million in cash.[6] The business had approximately 800 brokers at that time.

History[edit]
Piper Jaffray traces its roots to 1895 when George Lane established George B. Lane, Commercial Paper and Collateral Loans & Co., a commercial paper brokerage, in Minneapolis. In 1913, Piper, Jaffray Co. was established as another commercial paper business by H.C. Piper Sr. and Clive Palmer (C.P. or Palmer) Jaffray. In 1917, George B. Lane & Co. merged with Piper, Jaffray & Co. to form Lane, Piper & Jaffray.[4]
The firm first obtained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1931 with the acquisition of Hopwood & Company, which had been devastated by the stock market crash. In 1971, Piper first offered stock to the public and became a publicly held corporation known as Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Incorporated. Later, in 1986, Piper's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PIPR. In 1997, the firm was acquired by U.S. Bancorp, also based in Minneapolis, for $730 million in cash. From 1999 to 2003, the firm was known as U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In 2003, U.S. Bancorp spun off Piper Jaffray[5] in a stock dividend to its shareholders, making the company independent once again under the symbol PJC. In 2006, the company sold its brokerage business to Zurich-based UBS for $510 million in cash.[6] The business had approximately 800 brokers at that time.

Piper Jaffray and Kepler Cheuvreux announce exclusive equity research distribution agreement
MINNEAPOLIS/PARIS, February 21, 2017

Piper Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC), a leading investment bank and asset management firm and Kepler Cheuvreux, a leading independent
European broker, are pleased to announce their entry into a strategic partnership effective today.
The Paris-based firm will assist Piper Jaffray in the distribution of U.S. equity research in Europe
and furthermore, Piper Jaffray will assist Kepler Cheuvreux in the distribution of European equity
research in the U.S. While the initial partnership is founded on equity research distribution, it may
be expanded to other business areas.
Initially, Kepler Cheuvreux will work alongside existing Piper Jaffray sales teams in Europe to
distribute Piper Jaffray research to the U.K. and continental European clients. Kepler Cheuvreux
will introduce new European clients and the Piper Jaffray sales teams will act as U.S. product
specialists. Piper Jaffray will be Kepler Cheuvreux’s execution partner for U.S. equities.
Later in 2017, Piper Jaffray will work alongside existing Kepler Cheuvreux sales teams in the U.S.
to distribute Kepler Cheuvreux research to U.S. based clients. Piper Jaffray will introduce new
U.S. clients and the Kepler Cheuvreux sales teams will act as European product specialists.
Kepler Cheuvreux will be Piper Jaffray’s execution partner for European equities.
The Piper Jaffray equity research group consists of 40 senior analysts covering 750 companies in
the consumer, energy, financial institutions, healthcare, industrials and technology sectors. Kepler
Cheuvreux offers coverage on 736 European stocks, increasing coverage for both firms to over
1,480 companies as a result of the partnership.
“With Kepler Cheuvreux’s expansive client relationships, multi-local European presence and high
market share, our products will receive increased visibility in Europe. We are pleased to offer
similar advantages to Kepler Cheuvreux in the U.S.,” said Jeff Klinefelter, global head of equities
at Piper Jaffray. “This partnership comes as a logical progression after the recently announced
agreement with CIBC in the Canadian market.”
“The partnership with Piper Jaffray builds on our distribution agreement with CIMB, the Asian
broker, and furthers our goal of becoming a global broker in Europe. Indeed, we are now able to
offer our European clients coverage of over 2,200 stocks,” said Laurent Quirin, CEO of Kepler
Cheuvreux. “We are eager to expand our client coverage in the U.S. and assist Piper Jaffray with
their expansion in Europe.”

F5 Networks Gets 'Neutral' Rating at Piper Jaffray, Stock Slides









Amanda Schiavo




Jul 14, 2017 2:37 PM EDT













 














































































 Shares of F5 Networks Inc.  (FFIV) were falling by 3.39% to $12.94 on heavy trading volume on Friday afternoon, following a rating downgrade to "neutral" from "overweight" at Piper Jaffray & Co. The firm sees some challenges ahead for F5's product growth as the product refresh cycle isn't playing out the way that had been expected. The firm has set a price target of $136 on the stock, below its previous price target of $144. F5 Networks is a Seattle-based developer and provider of software defined application services. What's Hot On TheStreet More issues for food makers: As if food makers such as Kraft Heinz  (KHC)  and grocery retailers like Kroger  (KR)  and Walmart  (WMT)  didn't have enough issues on their plate thanks to Amazon's  (AMZN)  advances. A significant demographic headwind could add further pressure on the packaged food and grocery store sectors in the years ahead, according to Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mnushkin. The U.S. government reported recently that the fertility rate in the U.S. (births per 1,000 women) hit a record low of 62.0 in 2016, with the number of births down about 1% from the prior year. With births declining and immigration slowing, population growth in the U.S. has stalled. For the aforementioned sectors, Mnushkin points out, it's critical households are formed in order for demand to materialize. The fact that's not happening at a decent clip is troublesome.

Debt Capital Markets Update 
April 14, 2010













 

The Debt Capital Markets Update is published weekly and provides individuals with a summary and analysis of debt capital markets activity. 

 Market Commentary
In another sign that appetite for credit risk continues to build, 2010 has seen $8 billion in dividend recapitalizations come to the leveraged loan and high-yield markets.  While far from the $55 billion marks reached back in 2006 and 2007, it represents a significant improvement over the $4 billion in dividend deals for 2008 and $8 billion for all of 2009.
While the dividend recap trade is not open to all borrowers, those with low to moderate leverage who have performed well over the past several years are candidates; and a dividend can be an interim win for sponsors ahead of a future exit.

Experience the BeenVerified Difference
See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
