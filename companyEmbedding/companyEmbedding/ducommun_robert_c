Roots in '49er Days :  Ducommun: Final Chapter for State's Oldest Company? - latimes

Advertisement


YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→Aerospace Industry -- CaliforniaRoots in '49er Days :  Ducommun: Final Chapter for State's Oldest Company?April 17, 1989|DENISE GELLENE | Times Staff Writer


Its founder made a fortune selling picks and shovels to the '49ers who came to California in search of gold. One hundred-forty years later, the Los Angeles company that bears his name has lost more money than Charles L. Ducommun ever dreamed of.During the past five years, troubled Ducommun Inc. has sold off its metals and electronics operations to raise badly needed cash. The money-losing aerospace business that remains has been plagued with cost overruns, bloated inventories and production problems.The company has lost money for four straight years--a total of $67.5 million since the beginning of 1985. The situation is so grave that Alan N. Ducommun, the founder's 72-year-old grandson, gives California's oldest company only a 50-50 chance of survival. "It's pretty damn sick," he said.Whether the firm prospers depends a good deal on Norman A. Barkeley, a one-time chairman of Lear Siegler Corp. who became Ducommun's chairman in January. Former Lear Siegler colleagues say the 59-year-old Barkeley knows the aerospace business and is a good salesman. But they find it hard to evaluate his skills as a chief executive.Barkeley had been Lear Siegler's boss for only four months when the Santa Monica-based company was sold to Forstmann Little & Co., a New York investment firm, in December, 1986, after a bidding war involving a number of different players."I really don't know what he is like running a company," said James N. Thayer, Lear Siegler's former chief financial officer. "We were fighting a bunch of corporate raiders and all that external stuff. There wasn't enough time for him to run the company."Though Barkeley held important jobs during his 31 years at Lear Siegler, most decisions of any consequence were made by the company's longtime chairman, Robert T. Campion. "Bob Campion was a very strong guy," said Thayer, now chief executive of Gibraltar Financial. "He ran the company."Even so, NewSouth Capital Management Inc., a Memphis, Tenn.-based pension fund management firm that owns about 12% of Ducommun, thinks that Barkeley may be the right man for the job. "He's experienced in aerospace and is a hands-on manager, not a financial gymnast," said Charles Slatery, a portfolio manager for NewSouth. Barkeley wants to revive the company "if that's possible," Slatery added. "He'll sell it if it can't be turned around."Quiet, Hard-WorkingBarkeley is said to be quiet, reflective and hard-working, often starting 12-hour days at 6:30 a.m. He refused to comment for this story, saying through a spokeswoman that there was nothing new to say about Ducommun.Barkeley was introduced to Ducommun by director Thomas P. Mullaney, a Beverly Hills investment banker who had also been a Lear Siegler director. "We put him on the board to see if we could work with him," said Robert C. Ducommun, 37, a director and great-grandson of the company's founder. "If we all felt comfortable with him, we decided that we would bring him in as CEO."Barkeley joined the board in 1987, about the time he left Lear Siegler. He became Ducommun's president and chief executive last July.Robert Ducommun has nothing but praise for Barkeley, who has transformed Ducommun's upper management into something of a Lear Siegler alumni club. He has hired Lear Siegler's former treasurer, its human resources director and its auditor. The new head of Ducommun's troubled aerospace company, Jay-El Products, is also an ex-Lear Siegler executive.At the same time, Barkeley has reduced the company's work force by 15% to 1,000 employees since last summer."I think very highly of him and his team," Robert Ducommun said. "He has completely rebuilt the middle management of the company and has everyone thinking in terms of how we can become profitable.""He is trying to be a hero," said Alan Ducommun, who retired from the board last December. He said Barkeley might be able to keep the company going "if the banks stay with him." The company is negotiating a new loan agreement with its banker, Security Pacific. Ducommun's $15-million revolving credit line is secured by all its assets and expires on June 30, according to loan documents.Investment analysts say Barkeley will no doubt try to refinance the $38.6 million in convertible debt on the company's books. The debt is a heavy burden to the company and, because it is convertible into stock, has severely eroded the Ducommun family's ownership stake in the company. In fact, three large bondholders control more than 40% of the company, according to its 1988 proxy statement, while the family's position is just 23.4%.Lost a FortuneThe family and other shareholders have lost a fortune on paper as Ducommun's troubles have hammered down the company's stock price. Ducommun's shares closed Friday at $1.625 on the American Stock Exchange, down from a 1987 high of $21.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next
