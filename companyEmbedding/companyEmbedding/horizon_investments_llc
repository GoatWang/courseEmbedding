FLEXIBILITY can TURN CHANGES
INTO ADVANTAGES.



 
 
 





We believe the active and unpredictable market creates opportunities for experienced and disciplined managers to capture value for portfolios.



 



















OUR SCOPE






We believe a global perspective is crucial for an active strategy. The range of possibilities is expanded when we look at global capital markets rather than domestic alone. 
























OUr NATURE






The markets evolve. The next ten years most likely will not look like the last ten years. We must meet the world where it is rather than rely on where it was or assume where it will be. We believe a flexible response is required.
























OUR PRocess 






Our team, staffed with expertise in various disciplines, meets daily to make investment decisions based on multiple sources of information. We know what we own in the portfolio, and why.





 
 
 








100% Active



 
 
 







“We introduced the Horizon Active Asset Allocation Fund to give advisors and investors a simple way to invest in our Economic, Quantitative and Fundamental strategy through an actively managed, open-end mutual fund."
