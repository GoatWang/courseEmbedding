Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Kazazian Capital Fund, L.P. uses a long/short equity trading strategy. Our process combines technical screening, fundamental analysis and news flow to isolate opportunistic trading ideas with varying investment horizons. We understand that no strategy can generate excess return forever, so we use the research and development process to generate a pipeline of new ideas, keeping us a step ahead and minimizing year-to-year fluctuations in investor returns. This, coupled with stringent risk management, sets the fund apart from our competitors. The key to the Fund's long-term performance has been its ability to avert massive drawdowns, like the one seen in 2008, by constantly monitoring the risk in the portfolio and reacting swiftly to changes in the market.   AUM is not reported until December 2009.
