Title: Assistant Coach
               Company: East Carolina University
Job Details
               East Carolina has spent much of its gridiron history as a big-game hunter in search of high-profile opponents to slay. After beating Southern Miss and claiming the pole position in C-USA's East division, Holtz found himself in a unique scenario. Instead of entertaining inquiries about the challenges of pulling an upset, Holtz found himself addressing ECU's readiness to handle being hunted. "It's still one step at a time," Holtz said. "We hadn't even got to where we were in the hunt, let alone been the hunted. This game was big, there's no doubt. "We talked to our team all week about, this was not a big picture game. This was a game about us and Southern Miss. This was a game about how we had been beaten 84-17 the last two years, 51-10 the last time the seniors came down here. "This was a game of us against Southern Miss's program. This was just one at a time, focus on what we've got to get done out here, and they found a way to win." Retaining that focus will be paramount when the Pirates face Central Florida next week. The potential of a hangover against a wounded opponent can't be ignored. "We have to stay focused, stay hungry and stay humble," quarterback James Pinkney said. "It's the biggest win since I've been here. "It puts us on top of the conference on our side. We can't let down."
