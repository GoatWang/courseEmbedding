Overview





Our vision is to unlock the full potential of each learner.
Our mission is to accelerate learning through intuitive, engaging, efficient and effective experiences – grounded in research.
At McGraw-Hill Education, we believe that our contribution to unlocking a brighter future lies within the application of our deep understanding of how learning happens and how the mind develops. It exists where the science of learning meets the art of teaching.
Educators have been and always will be at the core of the learning experience. The solutions we develop help educators impart their knowledge to students more efficiently. We believe that harnessing technology can enhance learning inside and outside of the classroom and deepen the connections between students and teachers to empower greater success.
By partnering with educators around the globe, our learning engineers, content developers and pedagogical experts are developing increasingly open learning ecosystems that are proven to improve pass rates, elevate grades and increase engagement for each individual learner while improving outcomes for all.
Why? Because learning changes everything.

McGraw-Hill Education (MHE) is an American learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers[5][6] that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 4,800 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in nearly 60 languages.
Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.[7][8][9][10][11]
Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.[12] This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[13] and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite.[14] In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district.[15][16] In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. [17] The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.

Corporate history[edit]
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company.
In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.[18] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.[19]
In 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased Byte from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.[20][not in citation given]
In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.
On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion.[21] On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.[22]
In 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.[23]
McGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR. The company also sells books online at www.mheducation.co.in
On June 30, 2015 McGraw-Hill Education announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the CTB/McGraw-Hill assessment business.[24]
Corporate organization[edit]
Operating segments of McGraw-Hill Education include:

McGraw-Hill Education K-12, which develops curriculum solutions and content for early childhood education, K-12 learners, and adult education.
McGraw-Hill Education Higher Ed, which focuses on post-secondary education.
McGraw-Hill Education Professional, focused on post-graduate and professional learners.
McGraw-Hill Education International, which focuses on learners and professionals outside of the United States.

Other major subsidiaries, partners and investments:

ALEKS[25][26][27]
Area9 Aps[28][29][30]
Engrade[31][32]
Key Curriculum[33][34]
StudySync[35][36]

McGraw-Hill Education is also established in Asia, Australia, Canada (as McGraw Hill Ryerson) Europe, India, and Latin America (as McGraw-Hill Interamericana). In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.
Acquisitions[edit]
During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

McGraw-Hill Education (MHE) is an American learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers[5][6] that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 4,800 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in nearly 60 languages.
Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.[7][8][9][10][11]
Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.[12] This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[13] and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite.[14] In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district.[15][16] In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. [17] The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.

Corporate history[edit]
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company.
In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.[18] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.[19]
In 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased Byte from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.[20][not in citation given]
In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.
On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion.[21] On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.[22]
In 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.[23]
McGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR. The company also sells books online at www.mheducation.co.in
On June 30, 2015 McGraw-Hill Education announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the CTB/McGraw-Hill assessment business.[24]
Corporate organization[edit]
Operating segments of McGraw-Hill Education include:

McGraw-Hill Education K-12, which develops curriculum solutions and content for early childhood education, K-12 learners, and adult education.
McGraw-Hill Education Higher Ed, which focuses on post-secondary education.
McGraw-Hill Education Professional, focused on post-graduate and professional learners.
McGraw-Hill Education International, which focuses on learners and professionals outside of the United States.

Other major subsidiaries, partners and investments:

ALEKS[25][26][27]
Area9 Aps[28][29][30]
Engrade[31][32]
Key Curriculum[33][34]
StudySync[35][36]

McGraw-Hill Education is also established in Asia, Australia, Canada (as McGraw Hill Ryerson) Europe, India, and Latin America (as McGraw-Hill Interamericana). In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.
Acquisitions[edit]
During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

McGraw-Hill Education (MHE) is an American learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers[5][6] that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 4,800 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in nearly 60 languages.
Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.[7][8][9][10][11]
Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.[12] This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[13] and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite.[14] In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district.[15][16] In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. [17] The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.

Corporate history[edit]
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company.
In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.[18] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.[19]
In 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased Byte from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.[20][not in citation given]
In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.
On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion.[21] On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.[22]
In 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.[23]
McGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR. The company also sells books online at www.mheducation.co.in
On June 30, 2015 McGraw-Hill Education announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the CTB/McGraw-Hill assessment business.[24]
Corporate organization[edit]
Operating segments of McGraw-Hill Education include:

McGraw-Hill Education K-12, which develops curriculum solutions and content for early childhood education, K-12 learners, and adult education.
McGraw-Hill Education Higher Ed, which focuses on post-secondary education.
McGraw-Hill Education Professional, focused on post-graduate and professional learners.
McGraw-Hill Education International, which focuses on learners and professionals outside of the United States.

Other major subsidiaries, partners and investments:

ALEKS[25][26][27]
Area9 Aps[28][29][30]
Engrade[31][32]
Key Curriculum[33][34]
StudySync[35][36]

McGraw-Hill Education is also established in Asia, Australia, Canada (as McGraw Hill Ryerson) Europe, India, and Latin America (as McGraw-Hill Interamericana). In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.
Acquisitions[edit]
During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

McGraw-Hill maintained a general publishing division for some years, whose best known book was the (unpublished) Autobiography of Howard Hughes, a fake biography of Howard Hughes by Clifford Irving, which caused a scandal at the time.
The McGraw-Hill Building[edit]




1221 Avenue of the Americas, former McGraw-Hill headquarters


Main article: 1221 Avenue of the Americas
The company was based at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, otherwise known as the McGraw-Hill Building, until July 2015.[1]
The building in New York City has received prominent attention. In April 2008, surveillance camera footage was released of Nicholas White, a production manager for BusinessWeek (then published by McGraw-Hill) who was trapped in the building's elevator for 41 hours in October 1999.[31]
Connection to the family of George W. Bush[edit]
The McGraws and the George W. Bush family have close ties dating back several generations. Harold McGraw Jr. (deceased) was a member of the national grant advisory and founding board of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.[32]
McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union[edit]
Established in 1935, the McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union originally served employees of the McGraw-Hill companies in New York City only.[33] The credit union moved from its location inside the McGraw-Hill building to East Windsor, New Jersey, in 2005. Its accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. It provides savings, checking accounts, CDs, money-market accounts, IRAs, credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages.
Awards[edit]
In 1999, the National Building Museum presented the McGraw-Hill Companies with its annual Honor Award for the corporation's contributions to the built environment.[34]

McGraw-Hill maintained a general publishing division for some years, whose best known book was the (unpublished) Autobiography of Howard Hughes, a fake biography of Howard Hughes by Clifford Irving, which caused a scandal at the time.
The McGraw-Hill Building[edit]




1221 Avenue of the Americas, former McGraw-Hill headquarters


Main article: 1221 Avenue of the Americas
The company was based at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, otherwise known as the McGraw-Hill Building, until July 2015.[1]
The building in New York City has received prominent attention. In April 2008, surveillance camera footage was released of Nicholas White, a production manager for BusinessWeek (then published by McGraw-Hill) who was trapped in the building's elevator for 41 hours in October 1999.[31]
Connection to the family of George W. Bush[edit]
The McGraws and the George W. Bush family have close ties dating back several generations. Harold McGraw Jr. (deceased) was a member of the national grant advisory and founding board of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.[32]
McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union[edit]
Established in 1935, the McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union originally served employees of the McGraw-Hill companies in New York City only.[33] The credit union moved from its location inside the McGraw-Hill building to East Windsor, New Jersey, in 2005. Its accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. It provides savings, checking accounts, CDs, money-market accounts, IRAs, credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages.
Awards[edit]
In 1999, the National Building Museum presented the McGraw-Hill Companies with its annual Honor Award for the corporation's contributions to the built environment.[34]

We expect to receive approximately $     of net proceeds (based upon the assumed
initial public offering price of $     per share, the midpoint of the range set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus) from the sale of the common stock
offered by us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the
public offering would increase (decrease) our net proceeds by approximately
$     million.

We intend to use approximately $     million of the net proceeds from this
offering to pay related fees and expenses. The remaining net proceeds will be
used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.


We are one of the largest education companies in the world by revenue. Our
product portfolio and customer base span the entire educational spectrum, and as
a result we compete with a variety of companies in different product offerings.
Our larger competitors are currently Pearson, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Wiley
and Cengage. The focus on technology and digital products in education may
result in the emergence of additional competitors over time. We believe that we
are well positioned to compete in our markets. We primarily compete on the
quality of our content and effectiveness of our digital solutions, product
implementation support, brand and reputation, author reputation, customers’
history using our products and, to a lesser extent, price.


Company Description
We help unlock the potential of each learner by accelerating learning through
intuitive, engaging, efficient and effective experiences. We define the Science
of Learning as the understanding of how individuals learn and apply that
understanding, grounded in research, to our content, technology and


 user
experience to produce learning solutions that directly and positively impact
individual student outcomes. As a learning science company, our goal is to
empower educators and learners with information and intuitive learning
environments in which to engage more personally with each other and with
critical concepts in order to promote more effective and efficient learning.

We are a leading provider of outcome-focused learning solutions, delivering both
curated content and digital learning tools and platforms to the students in the
classrooms of approximately 250,000 higher education instructors, 13,000
pre-kindergarten through 12th grade (“K-12”) school districts and a wide variety
of academic institutions, professionals and companies in 140 countries. We have
evolved our business from a print-centric producer of textbooks and
instructional materials to a leader in the development of digital content and
technology-enabled adaptive learning solutions that are delivered anywhere,
anytime. We believe we have established a reputation as an industry leader in
the delivery of innovative educational content and methodologies. For example,
in the higher education market, we were the first in our industry to introduce
digital custom publishing, which permits instructors to tailor content to their
specific needs. We also created LearnSmart, one of the first digital adaptive
learning solutions in the higher education market, which leverages our
proprietary content and technology to provide a truly personalized learning
experience for students. Today we have over 1,500 adaptive products in higher
education. Since 2009, all of our major K-12 programs have also been created in
an entirely digital format.

We believe our brand, content, relationships, and distribution network provide
us with a distinct competitive advantage. Over our 125 year history, the
“McGraw-Hill” name has grown into a globally recognized brand associated with
trust, quality and innovation. We partner with more than 14,000 authors and
educators in various fields of study who contribute to our large and growing 
collection of proprietary content. Our collection includes well-known titles and
programs across each of our principal markets. For example, in the United States
higher education market, Economics: Principles, Problems, and Policies 
(McConnell/Brue/Flynn) is a leading Economics program. According to the
Association of American Publishers (“AAP”), our programs and learning solutions
in the U.S. K-12 market achieved a 30% market share in adoption states in 2016
driven by strong performance in the California reading/literacy new adoption and
a 25% market share overall. In addition, Harrison’s Principles of Internal
Medicine is one of the most widely-sold global medical reference solutions to
the professional market, with our complementary digital offering AccessMedicine
available in almost every medical school in the United States. We sell our
products and solutions across multiple platforms and distribution channels,
including our large network of approximately 1,550 sales professionals.

As learners and educators have become increasingly outcome-focused in their
search for more effective learning solutions, we have embraced adaptive learning
tools as a central feature of our digital learning solutions. Adaptive learning
is based on educational theory and cognitive science that emphasizes
personalized delivery of concepts, continuous assessment of gained and retained
knowledge and skills, and design of targeted and personalized study paths that
help students improve in their areas of weakness while retaining competencies.
We have developed a unique set of digital solutions by combining innovative
adaptive learning methods with our proprietary content and digital delivery
platforms. These solutions provide immediate feedback, and we believe they are
more effective than traditional print textbooks in driving positive student
outcomes. Students’ year-over-year performance can be impacted by many factors
outside the instructional materials used in class. We believe that even taking
into account these factors, our learning solutions can contribute to significant
improvements in students’ classroom performance as well as improved student
retention. For the instructor, time spent on active learning experiences
increases significantly as a result of a reduction in time spent on
administrative tasks and the availability of critical data to help better focus
in class instruction.

We have conducted numerous case studies for several of our learning solutions
for colleges that used Connect/LearnSmart, SmartBook and ALEKS, and in each case
where our solutions have been implemented, our case studies have yielded
positive findings when compared to class performance in periods immediately
prior to implementation, many of which have been considerable. For example,
according to a 2013 study by the Department of Chemistry, University of
California, Riverside, it was found that general chemistry students who
completed a pre-course assignment on ALEKS, an adaptive-responsive homework
system could expect their average final exam score to increase by over 13 points
when compared to nonparticipating students. Students who completed a precourse
assignment on a traditional responsive homework system saw an average increase
in their final exam score by 8 points versus those who did not participate.
Students who worked on the online homework for the entire quarter saw even
greater gains in their final exam scores compared to non-participants.

In the United States higher education market, where the pace of digital adoption
is the most rapid of all of our end markets, the success of our sales of
adaptive offerings has led to more than a 200 basis point increase in higher
education market share from 2012 to 2016 according to Management Practice, Inc.
(“MPI”), an independent education research firm.

Our four operating segments are:

(1) Higher Education (42% of total revenue in 2016): We are a top-three provider
    in the United States higher education market with a 21% market share for the
    year ended December 2016 according to MPI. We provide students, instructors
    and institutions with adaptive digital learning tools, digital platforms, 
    custom publishing solutions and traditional printed textbook products. The 
    primary users of our solutions are students enrolled in two- and four-year 
    non-profit colleges and universities, and to a lesser extent, for-profit 
    institutions. We sell our Higher Education solutions to well-known online 
    retailers, distribution partners and college bookstores, who subsequently 
    sell to students. We also increasingly sell via our proprietary e-commerce
    platform, primarily directly to students, which currently represents the 
    largest distribution channel in this segment, with revenue having grown from
    $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $172 million for the 
    year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 56% of 
    Higher Education revenue was derived from digital learning solutions.

(2) K-12 (35% of total revenue in 2016): We are a top-three provider in the   
    United States K-12 curriculum and learning solutions market with a 25%    
    market share for the year ended December 2016, an increase of more than 500
    basis points as compared to 2013, according to the AAP. We sell our learning
    solutions directly to K-12 school districts across the United States. While
    we offer all of our major curriculum and learning solutions in digital 
    format, given the varying degrees of availability and maturity of our 
    customers’ technological infrastructure, a majority of our sales are derived
    from selling blended print and digital solutions. We believe that the 
    quality of our blended offerings has been driving significant growth in both
    print and digital revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 18% of K-12
    revenue was derived from digital learning solutions.    

(3) International (16% of total revenue in 2016): We leverage our global scale,
    including approximately a 490 person sales force, brand recognition and 
    extensive product portfolio to serve students in the higher education, K-12
    and professional markets in 140 countries outside of the United States. Our
    products and solutions for the International segment are produced in more 
    than 60 languages and primarily originate from our offerings produced for 
    the United States market and that are later adapted to different 
    international markets. Sales of digital products are growing significantly 
    in this market, and we continue to increase our inventory of digital 
    solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 14% of International 
    revenue was derived from digital learning solutions.        

(4) Professional (7% of total revenue in 2016): We are a leading provider of  
    medical, technical, engineering and business content for the professional,
    education and test preparation communities. Our digital subscription      
    products had a 93% annual retention rate in 2016 and are sold to over     
    2,600 customers, including corporations, academic institutions, libraries 
    and hospitals. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 51% of Professional  
    revenue was derived from digital learning solutions, including digital    
    subscription sales.

McGraw-Hill Education (MHE) is an American learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers[5][6] that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 4,800 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in nearly 60 languages.
Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.[7][8][9][10][11]
Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.[12] This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[13] and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite.[14] In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district.[15][16] In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. [17] The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.

Corporate history[edit]
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company.
In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.[18] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.[19]
In 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased Byte from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.[20][not in citation given]
In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.
On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion.[21] On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.[22]
In 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.[23]
McGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR. The company also sells books online at www.mheducation.co.in
On June 30, 2015 McGraw-Hill Education announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the CTB/McGraw-Hill assessment business.[24]
Corporate organization[edit]
Operating segments of McGraw-Hill Education include:

McGraw-Hill Education K-12, which develops curriculum solutions and content for early childhood education, K-12 learners, and adult education.
McGraw-Hill Education Higher Ed, which focuses on post-secondary education.
McGraw-Hill Education Professional, focused on post-graduate and professional learners.
McGraw-Hill Education International, which focuses on learners and professionals outside of the United States.

Other major subsidiaries, partners and investments:

ALEKS[25][26][27]
Area9 Aps[28][29][30]
Engrade[31][32]
Key Curriculum[33][34]
StudySync[35][36]

McGraw-Hill Education is also established in Asia, Australia, Canada (as McGraw Hill Ryerson) Europe, India, and Latin America (as McGraw-Hill Interamericana). In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.
Acquisitions[edit]
During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

McGraw-Hill Education (MHE) is an American learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers[5][6] that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 4,800 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in nearly 60 languages.
Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.[7][8][9][10][11]
Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.[12] This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[13] and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite.[14] In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district.[15][16] In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. [17] The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.

Corporate history[edit]
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company.
In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.[18] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.[19]
In 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased Byte from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.[20][not in citation given]
In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.
On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion.[21] On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.[22]
In 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.[23]
McGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR. The company also sells books online at www.mheducation.co.in
On June 30, 2015 McGraw-Hill Education announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the CTB/McGraw-Hill assessment business.[24]
Corporate organization[edit]
Operating segments of McGraw-Hill Education include:

McGraw-Hill Education K-12, which develops curriculum solutions and content for early childhood education, K-12 learners, and adult education.
McGraw-Hill Education Higher Ed, which focuses on post-secondary education.
McGraw-Hill Education Professional, focused on post-graduate and professional learners.
McGraw-Hill Education International, which focuses on learners and professionals outside of the United States.

Other major subsidiaries, partners and investments:

ALEKS[25][26][27]
Area9 Aps[28][29][30]
Engrade[31][32]
Key Curriculum[33][34]
StudySync[35][36]

McGraw-Hill Education is also established in Asia, Australia, Canada (as McGraw Hill Ryerson) Europe, India, and Latin America (as McGraw-Hill Interamericana). In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.
Acquisitions[edit]
During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

McGraw-Hill Education (MHE) is an American learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers[5][6] that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill Education currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 4,800 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in nearly 60 languages.
Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, now S&P Global, McGraw-Hill Education was divested from McGraw Hill Financial and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.[7][8][9][10][11]
Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill Education has transitioned from a print-based business model to one based on delivering digital content and technology-enabled learning solutions.[12] This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning by assessing each student's skill level and using data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill Education provides digital products and services to over 11 million users. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[13] and after acquiring 20 percent equity stake in Area9 ApS went on to acquire the company, its development partner on the LearnSmart Advantage suite.[14] In 2015 MHE opened a new R&D office in Boston’s innovation district.[15][16] In September 2016 the company acquired adaptive learning technology and content provider Redbird Learning. [17] The company currently offers over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs.

Corporate history[edit]
McGraw-Hill Education traces its history back to 1888 when James H. McGraw, co-founder of the company, purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. His co-founder, John A. Hill, had also produced several technical and trade publications and in 1902 formed his own business, The Hill Publishing Company.
In 1909 both men agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. 1917 saw the merger of the remaining parts of each business into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.[18] In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the nation's largest publisher of educational material. The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the U.S.[19]
In 1979 McGraw-Hill Publishing Company purchased Byte from its owner/publisher Virginia Williamson who then became a vice-president of McGraw-Hill.
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc became The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1995, as part of a corporate identity rebranding.[20][not in citation given]
In 2007, The McGraw-Hill Companies launched an online student study network, GradeGuru.com. This offering gave McGraw-Hill an opportunity to connect directly with its end users, the students. The site closed on April 29, 2012.
On November 26, 2012, The McGraw-Hill Companies announced it was selling its entire education division to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion.[21] On March 22, 2013, it announced it had completed the sale and the proceeds were for $2.4 billion in cash.[22]
In 2014, McGraw Hill Education India partnered with GreyCampus to promote Online Learning Courses among University Grants Commission- National eligibility Test Aspirants.[23]
McGraw Hill Education India is located in Noida area of Delhi/NCR. The company also sells books online at www.mheducation.co.in
On June 30, 2015 McGraw-Hill Education announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the CTB/McGraw-Hill assessment business.[24]
Corporate organization[edit]
Operating segments of McGraw-Hill Education include:

McGraw-Hill Education K-12, which develops curriculum solutions and content for early childhood education, K-12 learners, and adult education.
McGraw-Hill Education Higher Ed, which focuses on post-secondary education.
McGraw-Hill Education Professional, focused on post-graduate and professional learners.
McGraw-Hill Education International, which focuses on learners and professionals outside of the United States.

Other major subsidiaries, partners and investments:

ALEKS[25][26][27]
Area9 Aps[28][29][30]
Engrade[31][32]
Key Curriculum[33][34]
StudySync[35][36]

McGraw-Hill Education is also established in Asia, Australia, Canada (as McGraw Hill Ryerson) Europe, India, and Latin America (as McGraw-Hill Interamericana). In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education acquired the entirety of shares in Tata McGraw-Hill Education Private Limited, the company's long-existing joint venture with Tata Group in India. The company is now known as McGraw Hill Education in India as well.
Acquisitions[edit]
During the course of its history, the McGraw-Hill Companies expanded significantly through acquisition, not just within the publishing industry but also into other areas such as financial services (the purchase of Standard & Poor's in 1966) and broadcasting (the 1972 acquisition of Time-Life Broadcasting). Many of these acquisitions stayed with McGraw-Hill Education after their acquisition by Apollo Global Management in 2013.

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of whitewashing history after it had published a caption in a geography textbook referring to American slaves as "workers."[52] The company quickly apologized, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[53] Since the controversy began in Houston, it has been linked to broader controversies about conservative texts at the Texas Education Agency.[54]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
