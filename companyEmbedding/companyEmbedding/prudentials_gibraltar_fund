7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Large Growth







The investment seeks growth of capital to an extent compatible with a concern for preservation of principal.
 The fund invests primarily in common stock and other securities convertible into common stock. Those investments can include ADRs, which are dollar-denominated certificates representing a right to receive securities of a foreign issuer. The managers seek to invest in medium to large companies that the managers believe possess sustainable, above-market growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows and reasonable valuations, resulting in a fund that exhibits growth characteristics blended with valuations comparable to that of the market.

Notes to Schedule of Investments (Unaudited)  Securities Valuation: Securities listed on a securities exchange (other than options on securities and indices) are valued at the last sale price on such exchange on the day of valuation or, if
there was no sale on such day, at the mean between the last reported bid and asked prices, or at the last bid price on such day in the absence of an asked price. Securities traded via NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price
(NOCP) on the day of valuation, or if there was no NOCP, at the last sale price. Securities that are actively traded in the over-the-counter market, including listed securities for which the primary market is believed by Prudential
Investments LLC (PI or Manager), in consultation with the subadviser; to be over-the-counter, are valued at market value using prices provided by an independent pricing agent or principal market maker. 
Securities for which market quotations are not readily available, or whose values have been affected by events occurring after the close of the
securitys foreign market and before the Funds normal pricing time, are valued at fair value in accordance with the Board of Directors approved fair valuation procedures. When determining the fair value of securities some of the
factors influencing the valuation include, the nature of any restrictions on disposition of the securities; assessment of the general liquidity of the securities; the issuers financial condition and the markets in which it does business; the
cost of the investment; the size of the holding and the capitalization of issuer; the prices of any recent transactions or bids/offers for such securities or any comparable securities; any available analyst media or other reports or information
deemed reliable by the investment adviser regarding the issuer or the markets or industry in which it operates. Using fair value to price securities may result in a value that is different from a securitys most recent closing price and from
the price used by other mutual funds to calculate their net asset values.  Investments in mutual funds are valued at the net asset value as of
the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the date of valuation.  Market values of investments traded in a foreign currency are translated
into U.S. dollars at the current rates of exchange.  Short-term debt securities, which mature in sixty days or less are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates fair value. The amortized cost method includes valuing a security at its cost on the date of purchase and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of the difference between the principal amount due at maturity
and cost. Short-term debt securities, which mature in more than sixty days, are valued at current market quotations.  The Fund invests in the
Prudential Core Taxable Money Market Fund (the Portfolio), a portfolio of Prudential Investment Portfolios 2. The Portfolio is a money market mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and managed by PI.
 Other information regarding the Fund is available in the Funds most recent Report to Shareholders. This information is available on
the Securities and Exchange Commissions website (www.sec.gov).

DEAR PLANHOLDER:



AS AN INVESTOR IN PRUDENTIAL'S GIBRALTAR FUND, YOU'VE ENTRUSTED US WITH YOUR
ASSETS. WE APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE SHOWN IN US.



AS YOU MAY KNOW, DRAMATICALLY RISING INTEREST RATES MADE 1994 A DIFFICULT YEAR
IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. IN OUR VIEW, 1995 WON'T BE A YEAR FOR TAKING RISKS,
EITHER. BE PREPARED FOR A YEAR OF MODEST  RETURNS.


THAT'S WHY WE'VE WRITTEN THIS REPORT. WE WANT TO REVIEW WITH YOU WHAT HAS
HAPPENED IN THE STOCK MARKET OVER THE LAST YEAR, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY. WE CONCLUDE THIS LETTER WITH OUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FINANCIAL
MARKETS IN 1995 -- WE LOOK FOR RETURNS IN THE STOCK MARKET THAT ARE CLOSER TO
LONG-TERM, HISTORICAL AVERAGES.



U.S. Financial Markets Review




THE BEST OF TIMES. THE WORST OF TIMES.



For the economy, 1994 was the best of times. Employment surged, manufacturing
output rose and consumer confidence was at its highest in years.  It was a good
year to look for a job.


Interest rates rose

higher and higher.


For the stock and bond markets, though, it felt like the worst of times.   The
Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index gained 1.3% on a total return basis. The bond
market had its worst year since 1927. The Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index
fell 2.9%.


What happened?  While optimists thought the economy was soaring like a rocket,
the Federal Reserve saw an unguided missile. As commodity prices began to climb
in late 1993 and early 1994, the nation's central bank feared higher inflation.
So the Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates: not once, but six times
in 1994, from 3% to 5.5%.


Ironically, it was the fear of inflation, not real inflation, that drove the
markets, since actual reported inflation never rose above 3% in 1994. Inflation
not only erodes our purchasing power, it also reduces the value of financial
assets: stock prices sag because corporate costs climb and the price of bonds
fall as interest rates rise.


Let's look a little closer at the stock market:



STOCKS:  A TUG-OF-WAR.



In the stock market, simultaneously rising corporate earnings and higher
interest rates puzzled  investors throughout the year.


As corporate earnings improved, so did the price of stocks. As the Federal
Reserve pushed interest rates higher, though, stock prices declined.


Despite this volatility, your portfolio managers were able to find some
opportunities:


/ /  INDUSTRIAL company stocks benefited from increasing economic activity
around the world. Demand for steel, paper and chemicals surged, and as
their prices rose, so did the stock prices of companies that produced
them.


/ /  TECHNOLOGY stocks performed well as world markets tried to catch up to
the U.S.'s  prowess in technology.


/ /  FINANCIAL stocks, including banks and insurance companies, looked
inexpensive. Financial services stocks had fallen because of fears of
rising interest rates, but did not recover as much as we had hoped.

GAINS AND INCREASE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF ANY NET LOSSES.

Investment Review




PRUDENTIAL'S GIBRALTAR FUND




PORTFOLIO MANAGER Bob Fetch



[Photo}


The Fund performed in line with the Lipper VIP Growth Fund Average in 1994, but
both were in negative territory. The Fund fell 1.3% while the average Lipper
fund lost 1%. The S&P 500 was up 1.3% for the year.


The Fund uses a value investment strategy; Portfolio Manager Bob Fetch buys
stocks that are inexpensively priced in relation to certain financial measures
of business worth, including earnings, book value and cash flow. As interest
rates rose in 1994, stock prices declined, presenting a number of value
investment opportunities. The Advisor has aggressively positioned the Fund to
take advantage of these situations.


Our holdings in 1994 were concentrated primarily in the industrial, consumer
growth, technology and financial sectors. In a year of turbulence, all of these
sectors with the exception of the financial sector were in positive territory.



INVESTMENT ACTIVITY.



The Fund's Advisor has continued its strategy to take advantage of the growing
global economic recovery.



INCREASED INDUSTRIALS.



As economic growth intensified during the year, the Fund continued to add to its
holdings in its largest sector, industrial stocks. By year end, 42% of assets
were in this sector, up from 33% at mid-year.  The Fund sold two railroad stocks
which were among its top holdings during the year, Kansas City Southern and
Southern Pacific Rail, when they reached their valuation targets. Later, as the
price of  Kansas City stock fell under intense selling pressure, the stock
became an excellent value once again because its growth potential remained
intact.  So the Advisor elected to purchase the stock again.


We did have a disappointment in this sector this year: Trinity Industries, a
railcar builder, fell 25% in price and was the Fund's fifth highest holding at
year end. It performed well in 1993 but gave back much of its gains in 1994.



CONSUMER GROWTH STOCKS SURGED.



Weakness in Trinity was offset in part by the Fund's exposure to consumer growth
stocks, where we held 15% of assets -- our second largest sector. The Fund's
largest single holding is in this sector:  Archer Daniels Midland, one of the
nation's largest food processing companies, which gained 43% in 1994. The stock
rose because the company's earnings climbed after several flat years.  Profits
improved on higher worldwide demand and improved crop yields.


Financial Sector:  Stock Selection Crucial.


In the financial sector, we benefited from stock selection, since the S&P
Financial Index was off 3% while our holdings fell by less than a percentage
point. Financial stocks amount to about 8% of assets.  The advisor expected bank
stocks to rise as regional banks continued to be considered as merger and
acquisition candidates by larger financial institutions. One disappointment in
this sector was Key Corp., a Cleveland-based regional bank, which fell 17% in
price during the year.

Investment Review




Investment Advisor's Outlook




INVESTMENT ADVISOR'S OUTLOOK.



1995 may be a better year for investors than 1994. But it won't be a year for
taking big risks. So be prepared for a year of returns closer to long-term
historical averages.



GROWTH AND INFLATION.



/ /  In 1995, we're looking for moderate growth from the U.S. economy. This
means Gross Domestic Product should slow from the 4.0% in 1994 to between 2.0%
to 2.5% by the end of 1995--a manageable figure and one that shouldn't cause
concern in either the bond or stock markets.


/ /  Inflation, 1994's big concern, will likely creep up to between 3.0% and
4.0% next year. Much of that increase has already been discounted by the markets
and shouldn't have a significant impact on long-term interest rates.


THE BIGGEST RISK TO OUR OUTLOOK? THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S INTEREST RATE HIKES COULD
CHOKE OFF GROWTH, OR THERE COULD BE A BIG CHANGE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN
COMMODITIES (POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF A WAR OR NATURAL DISASTER) THAT COULD RAISE THE
INFLATION ANTE.



THE U.S. STOCK MARKET.



/ /  The U.S. stock market appears headed for an average year in 1995. That
means total returns possibly in the high single digits. Of course, we haven't
thought for awhile that the handsome double-digit returns we enjoyed in the
1980s would materialize again any  time soon, so anything in excess of inflation
looks pretty fair. And if inflation remains relatively benign as we expect,
market returns after inflation will be close to historic averages.


/ /  Corporate earnings growth and investor demand should play a big role in
stock performance in 1995. However, if either is tepid, expect our return
forecast to fall accordingly. Stock values are still a bit ahead of earnings, as
well, which could indicate some type of correction is likely. This is a year
when stock selection will be crucial.



ON THE OTHER HAND? IF ECONOMIC GROWTH STALLS OUT, EXPECT STOCK PRICES TO FALL.




THAT COMPLETES OUR REVIEW OF 1994 AND OUR OUTLOOK FOR 1995.  WE TRUST YOU FOUND
IT HELPFUL.

Stock  Exchange on the principal exchange on which such securities are traded on
the last business day of the year.  For any securities not traded on a  national
securities  exchange but traded in the over-the-counter market, the value is the
last bid  price  available, except  that  securities for  which  quotations  are
furnished  through  a  nationwide  automated quotation  system  approved  by the
National Association  of Securities  Dealers, Inc.  (NASDAQ) are  valued at  the
closing  best bid price on  the date of valuation  provided by a pricing service
which utilizes NASDAQ quotations. Short-term investments are valued at amortized
cost which, with accrued interest, approximates market value. Amortized cost  is
computed  using  the  cost  on  the  date  of  purchase  adjusted  for  constant
amortization of discount or premium to maturity.


SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:   Dividend income is recorded  on
the   ex-dividend  date.  Interest   income  is  accrued   daily  on  short-term
investments. Interest income also includes net amortization from the purchase of
fixed-income  securities.  Security  transactions  are  recorded  on  the  first
business  day following  the trade  date, except  that transactions  on the last
business day of the  reporting cycle are recorded  on that day. Transactions  in
short-term  debt securities are  recorded on the trade  date. Realized gains and
losses from  securities transactions  are determined  and accounted  for on  the
basis of identified cost.


DISTRIBUTIONS  AND TAXES:  As  in prior years, the Fund  intends to qualify as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As
a result, by distributing substantially all of its net investment income and net
realized capital gains, the Fund  will not be subject  to federal income tax  on
the  investment income and capital  gains so distributed. Dividend distributions
to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.



NOTE 3:  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES



INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE:   The  investment management fee,  which is  computed
daily  at an effective annual rate  of 0.125% of the net  assets of the Fund, is
payable to  The Prudential  Insurance  Company of  America (The  Prudential)  as
required by the investment advisory agreement. Under the terms of the investment
advisory agreement and a separate contract which remains in force as long as The
Prudential,  or its separate  accounts, or organizations approved  by it are the
only purchasers of  Fund shares, The  Prudential pays all  expenses of the  Fund
except  for fees and expenses of those  members of the Fund's Board of Directors
who are not officers or employees of The Prudential and its affiliates; transfer
and any other local, state or federal taxes; and brokers' commissions and  other
fees and charges attributable to investment transactions.


BROKERAGE  COMMISSIONS:    For  the year  ended  December  31,  1994, Prudential
Securities Incorporated, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of The Prudential,
earned $0 in brokerage commissions from  transactions executed on behalf of  the
Fund.



NOTE 4:  DISTRIBUTIONS



Dividends  from net investment income and net realized capital gains of the Fund
will normally  be declared  and  reinvested in  additional full  and  fractional
shares twice a year.



NOTE 5:  PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES



The  aggregate  cost of  purchases  and the  proceeds  from sales  of securities
(excluding short-term  investments) for  the year  ended December  31, 1994  was

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Prudential's Gibraltar Fund:



We  have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Prudential's Gibraltar Fund, as of December  31,
1994,  the  related statement  of operations  for  the year  then ended  and the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the   Fund's
management.  Our  responsibility is  to express  an  opinion on  these financial
statements based on our audits.


We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted   auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 1994, by correspondence with
the  custodian  and brokers.  An audit  also  includes assessing  the accounting
principles used  and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  as  well  as
evaluating  the overall  financial statement  presentation. We  believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our  opinion,  such financial  statements  present fairly,  in  all  material
respects,  the financial position of Prudential's  Gibraltar Fund as of December
31, 1994, the results of its operations for the year then ended and the  changes
in  its  net assets  for each  of  the two  years in  the  period then  ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

For federal  income tax  purposes,  Prudential's Investment  Plan Account  is  a
separate entity taxable as a corporation, and as such has elected to be taxed as

tax on the investment income and capital gains so distributed.

PRUDENTIAL'S ANNUITY PLAN ACCOUNT




NOTE 1:  MORTALITY RISK, EXPENSE RISK, AND ADMINISTRATION CHARGES



The  mortality  risk charge,  the expense  risk  charge, and  the administration
charge, at effective annual  rates of 0.075%,  0.150%, and 0.150%,  respectively

NOTE 2:  TAXES



The operations of  Prudential's Annuity  Plan Account form  a part  of, and  are
taxed  with, the operations of The  Prudential. Under the Internal Revenue Code,
all ordinary income and capital gains allocated to the annuitants are not  taxed

federal income taxes on such distributions received by the Account.



NOTE 3:  NET DECREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM SURPLUS TRANSFERS



The decrease in net assets resulting  from surplus transfers represents the  net
contributions of The Prudential to the Account.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To Planholders of Prudential's Investment Plan Account
Prudential's Annuity Plan Account

Prudential's Annuity Plan Account-2
and the Board of Directors of The Prudential Insurance
Company of America:


We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets of:


Prudential's Investment Plan Account
Prudential's Annuity Plan Account
Prudential's Annuity Plan Account-2


of The Prudential Insurance Company of America as of December 31, 1994, and the
related statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the share information for each of the five years in the period then ended. These
financial statements and share information are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and share information based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and share
information are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
December 31, 1994. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, such financial statements and share information present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Prudential's Investment Plan
Account, Prudential's Annuity Plan Account and Prudential's Annuity Plan
Account-2 as of December 31, 1994, the results of their operations, the changes
in their net assets, and the share information for the respective stated periods
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT



The  accompanying  financial statements  and all  information in  the annual
report are  the  responsibility  of  management.  They  have  been  prepared  in
conformity   with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The  statements
necessarily include amounts based on management's best estimates and  judgments.
Information  presented in  one section of  the annual report  is consistent with
information dealing  with  the  same or  substantially  similar  subject  matter
presented elsewhere in the annual report.


The   systems  of   internal  controls  for   Prudential's  Gibraltar  Fund,
Prudential's Investment  Plan Account,  Prudential's  Annuity Plan  Account  and
Prudential's  Annuity Plan Account-2  (Program) are integral  parts of those for
The  Prudential  Insurance  Company  of  America  (The  Prudential).  As   such,
management depends upon The Prudential's systems of internal controls in meeting
its  responsibilities  for  reliable  financial  statements.  These  systems are
designed to provide reasonable  assurance that assets  are safeguarded and  that
transactions  are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's
authorization. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the premise  that
the  cost  of internal  controls  should not  exceed  the benefits  derived. The
control environment  is enhanced  by  the selection  and training  of  competent
management,  a business ethics policy demanding the highest standards of conduct
by employees in carrying out the Program's affairs, organizational  arrangements
that  provide for  segregation of  duties and  delegation of  authority, and the
communication of accounting and operating policies and procedures throughout the
organization. In  addition, The  Prudential maintains  a professional  staff  of
internal  auditors who monitor the  Program's control structure through periodic
reviews and tests of the control aspects of accounting, financial and  operating
activities.  The internal  auditors coordinate  their program  with that  of the
independent certified public accountants.


The financial statements have been  audited by Deloitte & Touche,  Certified
Public  Accountants.  The independent  auditor's reports,  which appear  in this
annual report, each express an independent professional opinion on the  fairness
of  presentation of management's  financial statements. The  auditors review the
Program's  financial  and  accounting  controls  and  conduct  such  tests   and
procedures as they deem necessary under generally accepted auditing standards.


The  Prudential's Board  of Directors,  through its  Auditing Committee, and
Prudential's  Gibraltar   Fund's  Board   of  Directors   monitor   management's
fulfillment   of  its   responsibilities  for   accurate  accounting,  statement
preparation and protection  of assets.  The Prudential's  Auditing Committee  is
composed  solely of outside directors and Prudential's Gibraltar Fund's Board of
Directors has a majority  of outside directors.  Both The Prudential's  Auditing
Committee and the outside directors of Prudential's Gibraltar Fund meet with the
independent  certified  public  accountants,  management  and  internal auditors
periodically  to   evaluate  the   discharge  by   each  of   their   respective
responsibilities.  Each has free  and separate access  to the Auditing Committee
and Prudential's  Gibraltar Fund's  Board of  Directors to  discuss  accounting,
financial reporting, internal control and auditing matters.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS FOR THE REPORT TO PLANHOLDERS


(NOTE: ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION WILL BE FOUND IN NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)


ACCUMULATION  UNIT -- The measure for  determining the Planholder's share in the
separate account of a deferred  variable annuity during the accumulation  period
before  annuity  benefits  begin to  be  paid. Planholder  transactions  such as
purchase payments, transfers, and withdrawals result in changes to the number of
accumulation units  credited to  the Planholder.  Investment results  and  daily
charges affect the value of the accumulation unit.


ANNUITY  UNIT -- The measure  of the fixed number  of benefit units purchased by
the accumulation units when annuitizing via a variable payout annuity.


AMERICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPT (ADR) -- A certificate issued by an American bank to
evidence ownership of a block of  foreign shares. The certificate can be  traded
like a share of stock.


CERTIFICATE  OF DEPOSIT (CD) -- A  short-term, interest-bearing bond issued by a
bank or a savings and loan.


COMMERCIAL PAPER -- A short-term, unsecured  promissory note issued by either  a
corporation or bank.

MARKET  VALUE -- The dollar value of a security on a given day, usually based on
the last sales price of that given day.


PREFERRED STOCK --  A high  quality unit of  ownership of  a public  corporation
which entitles the holder to preference over common stock holders in the payment
of dividends. (see also Stock)

Calculated as the sale price minus the purchase price.


REPURCHASE AGREEMENT -- An agreement where an  investor loans cash to a bank  in
exchange  for a Treasury security  held as collateral and  interest on the loan.
The agreement indicates  that the  cash and  collateral are  exchanged back  the
following day. These securities are used to invest idle cash.


RESTRICTED  SECURITY --  A security  which is sold  privately because  it is not
registered with the SEC.


RIGHT -- Privilege granted to stockholders of  a company to buy shares of a  new
issue  of common stock (at a price below the public offering price) before it is
offered to the public.


STOCK -- Unit  of ownership in  a public corporation.  The value of  a share  of
stock  varies,  according  to how  buyers  and  sellers of  the  stock  view the
corporation's future success. Shareholders generally receive dividend  payments,
which  are their  part of  the corporation's  earnings. (see  also Common Stock;
Preferred Stock)


TIME DEPOSIT (TD) -- A  non-negotiable short-term, interest bearing bond  issued
by a bank or savings & loan. The maturity period can be from 1 day to 6 months.

based on its daily market price and its original purchase price. A gain or  loss
is "unrealized" until the sale of the security.

common stock at a specified price (usually  higher than the market price at  the
time of issuance), over a period of years.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
