Giggles N' Hugs Partners With The Licensing Shop, Inc.HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Giggles N' Hugs Partners With The Licensing Shop, Inc.MarketwireAugust 20, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareLOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwire -08/20/12)- Giggles N' Hugs, Inc. (GIGL) (GIGL), an upscale, children's themed restaurant, has partnered with The Licensing Shop, Inc. (TLS) to develop and support the company's brand merchandising strategy.Giggles N' Hugs offers an upscale, family-friendly restaurant with a play area dedicated to children 10 years and younger. The restaurant has a high-quality menu made from fresh, organic foods that are enjoyed by both children and adults.Joey Parsi founded the company in 2007 after what he describes as a "void in the marketplace" for restaurants that encourage kids to be themselves and play while parents can enjoy a quality meal in a casual setting. Giggles N' Hugs has become a hot spot for all parents including many Hollywood celebrities such as Adam Sandler, Mark Wahlberg, Halle Berry, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck to name a few. Giggles N' Hugs has also been featured in many news and entertainment publications, including Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, People Magazine, US Magazine, New York Post and many others. Among its family-friendly vibe, Giggles N' Hugs is also known for their own creation called "Mom's Tricky Treat Sauce," which hides pureed vegetables in kids' favorite meals such as pizza and macaroni and cheese."The early success of our first two locations has led us to engage licensing and merchandising experts like The Licensing Shop to help build our brand," said Parsi. "We plan to extend the quality experience of our differentiated concept into on-brand products that can be sold within our physical locations, as well as retail partners. These items will include branded children's clothing, frozen foods with our Mom's Tricky Treat Sauce, coloring books, toys and other children related products. As we look to expand company-owned stores and franchises, our branded products are yet another way we are able to provide our unique items that both kids and parents can agree on. Given TLS's strong track record, we believe their brand expertise can help bring us there."In addition to backfilling the Southern California market, the company's growth expectations include markets like Seattle, Vancouver and the East coast, and they one day envision a premier family-friendly concept with many locations nationwide.Steve Fowler, president of TLS, commented: "We are eager to kick off our partnership to help create and deploy a comprehensive branding strategy based on this unique restaurant concept. Ultimately, I think today's generation of parents are looking for a higher quality experience and our team has the ability to take this idea to the next level."TLS was founded in 2006 by Steve and Nancy Fowler and counts as its clients such brands as Dino Dan and Skechers. Nancy was formerly the President of DIC Consumer Products' Worldwide division overseeing licensing programs for American Greetings (Strawberry Shortcake) and McDonald's. She was also the Vice President of Worldwide Licensing for Paramount Pictures. For this project, TLS has partnered with top licensing executive Cindy Davis, the former Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Licensing for Copyright Promotions Licensing Group (CPLG) and Cookie Jar Entertainment and Vice President of Licensing for DIC Entertainment.About The Licensing ShopThe Licensing Shop, Inc. (TLS) is a brand licensing agency specializing in the strategic development of consumer products based on multi-platform entertainment programs, celebrities and fashion brands. The company's expertise focuses on extending brands into licensed products, creating new revenue streams for its clients in addition to the incremental marketing benefits of reaching new consumers.
