Our Company – Funding Wonder























































 





Our Company










 

Our Vision
Funding Wonder will fundamentally change the relationship between businesses and the communities they serve. Banks have traditionally acted as intermediaries, collecting money from depositors and deciding when and where to lend it out.
The Funding Wonder Marketplace bypasses the middlemen by directly connecting investors and small businesses to help each achieve their financial goals.















What is Funding Wonder?
										Funding Wonder is a business loan exchange that secures financing for franchise businesses which are growing faster than the economy as a whole and collectively account for  billion in economic output. Funding Wonder empowers investors and businesses to achieve their financial goals by bringing them together on a trusted, SEC registered portal to directly interact and transact. Accredited and non-accredited investors can invest in debt securities for businesses with proven franchise models that have been certified by Funding Wonder, and return principal and interest through monthly payments. Small business owners, in turn, gain access to a vital alternative source of capital.

FAQs for Business Owners














							Crowdfunding generally refers to a financing method in which money is raised through soliciting relatively small individual investments or contributions from a large number of people.  Over the last few years, crowdfunding websites in the United States have proven a popular way by which to solicit charitable donations and to raise funds for artistic endeavors like films and music recordings.
						


							Under recently adopted rules, the general public now has the opportunity to participate in capital raising for small businesses. 
						


							You can only invest in a crowdfunding offering through the online platform, such as a website or a mobile app, of a broker-dealer or a funding portal such as Funding Wonder.  Companies may not offer crowdfunding investments to you directly - they must use a broker-dealer or funding portal.
						


							The funding portal must be registered with the SEC and be a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
							You can obtain information about our funding portal by visiting the SEC’s EDGAR website.
							Keep in mind that you will have to open an account with our funding portal in order to make an investment, all written communications relating to your crowdfunding investment will be electronic.

The Funding Wonder Site
						This Site is an SEC-registered funding portal and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) operated by Funding Wonder Crowd, LLC to act as an intermediary platform website through which Issuers offer and sell their securities to potential investors pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
						
						
						Issuers that register with and are approved by the Site to sell securities are able to create and post offering materials on the Site for potential investors to review.
						

						Information about specific offerings, including SEC-required documents, promotional material like videos, and communications about an offering, are publicly viewable on the site.
						

						Potential investors interested in using the Site to participate in investment opportunities and/or to communicate on the site with others about them must register with the Site by opening an account. This entails providing certain personal and non-personal information to the Site, its affiliates and/or service providers prior to making an investment, including documentation related to the investor’s income and net worth. This information is used to verify an investor is qualified to invest in investment opportunities posted on this Site.  For further information on investment limitations when using this Site, please see “Investment Limitations under Reg CF” below.
						


Offer, Purchase and Issuance of Securities on Funding Wonder
						After opening an account, an investor will be able to search for various investment opportunities on the Site; review all campaign and investment materials posted on the Site; and communicate about a specific offering with the issuer and its agents as well as with other investors on the site.
						
						
						Once an investor decides to purchase securities from a particular Issuer, the investor authorizes a transfer of funds to an escrow account where they are held until the offering campaign is completed. The Site does not and cannot hold funds and they must not be sent to it. The escrow account is maintained by a separate qualified escrow agent with a depositary such as a bank. After completion of the campaign, the escrow agent will release the aggregate funds contributed from all investors and the Issuer will issue securities to all investors.
						


The Securities Offered on Funding Wonder
						Investment opportunities posted on the Site are debt securities for small businesses.  Federal securities law requires securities sold in the United States to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), unless the sale qualifies for an exemption. The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act, and are offered in reliance on the crowdfunding exemptive provisions of Section 4(a) (6) of the Securities Act.
						
						
Securities sold on Funding Wonder are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. No assurance can be given that any investment opportunity will continue to qualify under one or more of such exemptions under the Securities Act due to, among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or a change of any securities law or regulation that has retroactive effect.
						

						Please be sure to read the “Investment Appropriateness and Risks” section below carefully. For a discussion of the specific risks involved in making an investment in a particular Issuer’s offering, please be sure to carefully review the risks discussed in each Issuer’s offering materials, including the section titled “Risk Factors” in such materials.
						


Annual Reporting Obligations of Issuers on Funding Wonder
						Pursuant to Reg CF, each Issuer that posts offerings of securities on the Site is required to annually file with the SEC a Form C-AR and financial statements. This must be done no later than 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year covered by such filing.  Each Issuer must also post its Form C-AR and financial statements to its own website.
						
						
						The Form C-AR contains updated disclosure substantially similar to that provided in the Issuer’s initial offering statement on Form C, including information on the Issuer’s size, location, principals and employees, business, plan of operations and the risks of investment in the Issuer’s securities; however, offering-specific disclosure is not required to be disclosed in the Form C-AR.
						

						Investors should be aware that in certain circumstances, an Issuer may no longer be required to continue its annual reporting obligations under Reg CF, including in the event (i) that the Issuer has fewer than 300 stockholders of record after filing at least one Form C-AR in the last year, (ii) its total assets are equal to or less than $10 million after filing a Form C-AR for at least three years prior, (iii) the Issuer undergoes liquidation or dissolution or (iv) all of the Issuer’s issued securities are repurchased by the Issuer or another party.  In the event that an Issuer ceases to publish annual reports, investors may no longer have available to them current financial information about the Issuer.

						Potential investors using the Site to purchase securities are prohibited by Reg CF from purchasing a total dollar amount of securities from all Reg CF sites exceeding the following amounts during the 12-month period preceding such purchase:
						
If either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than $100,000, the investor is limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of the lesser of his, her or its annual income or net worth.
If the annual income and net worth of the investor are both equal to or greater than $100,000, the investor is limited to 10% of the lesser of his, her or its annual income or net worth, not to exceed $100,000.

						To calculate an investor’s “net worth”’ Reg CF relies on the same method used for determining “accredited investor” status under Regulation D of the Securities Act, which excludes the value of an investor’s primary residence. Investors may include their spouse’s income for the purposes of the test. Both the SEC’s Investor Bulletin and FINRA’s Investor Alert contain detailed information about how to perform these calculations.

						
						

Cancelling an Investment Commitment
						Investors may cancel an investment commitment until forty-eight (48) hours prior to the deadline identified in an Issuer’s offering materials posted on the Site.  The Site will notify investors by [email] when the target offering amount has been met.
						
						
						If an Issuer reaches its target offering amount prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials, it may close the offering early so long as it provides investors notice of the new offering deadline at least five (5) business days prior to the new offering deadline. The Site may continue to accept investment commitments during this 5-day period.
						

						If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment 48 hours prior to the offering deadline, the funds will be released to the Issuer by the escrow agent upon closing of the offering. The investor will receive securities in exchange for his, her or its investment.  If an investment commitment is cancelled, the Site will direct the return of any funds that have been committed by investors in the offering.
						

						If a material change is made to the offering materials, including a change to the offering deadline, the Site will require investors to reconfirm their investment.  If an investor does not reconfirm his, her or its investment commitment after a material change is made to the offering, the investor’s investment commitment will be cancelled and the committed funds will be returned to the investor.

						

INVESTMENT APPROPRIATENESS AND RISKS

You Are Solely Responsible for Determining an Investment is Appropriate for You.


						Prior to registering on Funding Wonder or making an investment commitment, a potential investor must consider the risks of investing in crowdfunded securities offerings and determine whether such an investment is appropriate.  The Site and its employees are prohibited from offering advice about any offering posted on the Site and from recommending any investment.
						

						This means the decision to invest or contribute must be based solely on the potential investor’s own individualized consideration and analysis of the risks involved in a particular investment opportunity posted on the Site, which is made at the investor’s own risk.
						

						Potential investors acknowledge and agree that they are solely responsible for determining their own suitability for an investment or strategy on the Site and must accept the risks associated with such decisions, which include the risk of losing the entire amount of their principal. Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
						

						The Site has no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to potential investors and investors’ use of the Site does not create such a relationship.  Potential investors agree and acknowledge that they are responsible for conducting their own legal, accounting and other due diligence review of the investment opportunities posted on the Site.
						

EACH INVESTOR IS STRONGLY ADVISED TO CONSULT LEGAL, TAX, INVESTMENT, ACCOUNTING AND/OR OTHER PROFESSIONALS BEFORE INVESTING, AND TO CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL THE SPECIFIC RISK DISCLOSURES PROVIDED AS PART OF ANY OFFERING MATERIALS, AND TO ASK EACH ISSUER OFFERING SECURITIES ANY QUESTIONS OR FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PRIOR TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT.


There is no independent governmental or regulatory review of the offering or offering materials


						No governmental agency has reviewed the investment opportunities posted on this Site and no state or federal agency has passed upon either the adequacy of the disclosure contained therein or the fairness of the terms of any such investment opportunity.
						

						The exemptions relied upon for the investment opportunities posted on the Site are significantly dependent upon the accuracy of the representations of the Issuers offering securities through the Site and the potential investors registered with the Site. These risks highlighted in the following are non-exhaustive and are intended to highlight certain risks associated with investing in securities that are not registered with the SEC.

						


Restriction on Resale of Securities Offered
						The securities offered on the Site are only suitable for potential investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risks associated with private investments. Securities sold through this Site are restricted and not publicly traded and, therefore, are illiquid unless registered with the SEC.
						
						
						Securities issued in a transaction pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act may not be transferred by any purchaser of such securities for a one-year period after such securities were issued, unless such securities are transferred: (i) to the issuer of the securities, (ii) to an “accredited investor” (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) or such purchaser has reasonable belief that such transferee is an “accredited investor”, (iii) as part of an offering registered with the SEC, or (iv) to a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, to a trust controlled by the purchaser, to a trust created for the benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, or in connection with the death or divorce of the purchaser or other similar circumstance.

						


Investors in Small Companies May, and Frequently Do, Lose All of Their Investment.
						Investing in private securities offerings requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity need, and long-term commitment.  Investment in small, especially start-up and early stage, companies is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While promised or targeted returns on the amount invested should reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment, such returns may never be realized and/or may not be adequate to compensate an Investor for risks taken. Loss of an Investor’s entire investment is very possible and can easily occur. Even the timing of any payment of a return on an investment is highly speculative.
						
						
						Among many factors to consider is that the Issuer's management may be inexperienced. Due to inexperience management may not be able to execute on its business plan. An investor may not be able to evaluate the Company’s operating history; indeed, there may be none.
						

						The Issuer may have serious risks specific to its industry or business model. Demand for a product or service may be seasonal or be impacted by the overall economy.  Small businesses, in particular, often depend heavily upon a single customer, supplier, or upon one or a small number of employee (s). It may have difficulty competing against larger companies who can negotiate for better prices from suppliers, produce goods and services on a large scale more economically, or take advantage of bigger marketing budgets.

						


The Company may not have audited financial statements or even be required to provide investors with any annual audited financial statements
						Audited financial statements are not required for Reg. CF offerings under $500,000.00. The company is not required to provide you with annual audited financial statements or quarterly unaudited financial statements, except as explained above. The Issuer may not even have its financial statements audited, or even reviewed by outside auditors. Your decision to make an investment in the Issuer will be based upon the information the Issuer provides in its offering materials, which may not completely or even accurately represent the financial condition of the company.
						
						

The Issuer may lack adequate financial controls and procedures.
						The Issuer in all likelihood will not have an internal control infrastructure. It will not have the controls you would expect to find in a publicly-held company subject to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes Oxley”). Because the Issuer will not be subject to Sarbanes Oxley, its financial and disclosure controls and procedures will reflect its status as a development stage, non-public company.
						
						
						There can be no assurance of no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of the Issuer’s financial and disclosure controls and procedures. Indeed, if it were necessary to implement such financial and disclosure controls and procedures, the cost to the Issuer might even have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s results of operations.
						


Lack of information to monitor and value an Issuer.
						As explained above, an Investor may not be able to obtain the information it wants regarding a particular Issuer on a timely basis, or at all. It is possible that the Investor may not be aware of material adverse changes that have occurred at the Issuer. An Investor may not be able to get accurate information about an Issuer’s current value at any given time.
						
						
						The Issuer's management may have broad discretion over how the Issuer uses the net proceeds of an offering.
						

						Unless the Company has agreed to a specific use of the proceeds from the offering, the Issuer’s management will usually have considerable discretion over how to use the capital raised. You may not have any assurance the Issuer will use the proceeds appropriately. You should pay close attention to what the issuer says about how offering proceeds are to be used.

						


Lack of control.
						Because the Issuer's founders, directors and executive officers may be among its largest stockholders, they may be able to exert significant control over the Issuer's business and affairs and may even have actual or potential interests that diverge from those of other Investors. This may worsen as time goes on if the holdings of the Issuer's directors and executive officers increase upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under options or warrants they may hold, or in the future be granted. In addition to holding or controlling board seats and offices, these persons may well have significant influence over and control of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, separate from how the Issuer's other stockholders, including Investors, may vote in a given offering.

						
						

Completion of Offering and Relationship between Issuer and the Site
						Investors that participate in an offering on the Site should be aware that once an offering has completed, and an investor has received securities from the Issuer, there may or may not be any ongoing relationship between the Issuer and the Site.  Any questions or concerns related to such Issuer’s securities and continued disclosure provided in such Issuer’s annual reports on Form C-AR must be forwarded directly to such Issuer once an offering on the Site is completed.  The Site assumes no liability or responsibility, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or related to the use of or reliance on any disclosures made or services provided by the Issuer once the Issuer’s offering on the Site is completed.

Creating a Posting





									Q: How does my business obtain financing?								



Apply online at www.fundingwonder.com
During the registration and online application process you will be asked to submit company details and documentation such as recent tax returns, income statements, bank statements and balance sheet to support your application. The type of financial statements will vary depending on the size of your loan.
You will also receive instructions to guide you through the email and bank account verification processes.
Once completed, your application will be reviewed by our credit assessment team.
You will be notified via e-mail if your application gets approved by Funding Wonder.
Should we require more information, our credit team will contact you.
Once your loan request is approved by Funding Wonder and you have filed a Form C with the Securities Exchange Commission, your business will be posted in the Funding Wonder Marketplace.










									Q: What types of loans can a business post on Funding Wonder?								


Funding Wonder generally posts loan requests with the following attributes:

Amount – $50,000 to $500,000.
Term – 12 months to 60 months.
Repayment – Monthly principal and interest payments back to investors.
Security – Personal guarantees from director/owner and may also be secured by assets or property.






Fees and Charges





									Q: What does Funding Wonder charge?								


There are no fees to apply and pre-qualify to post your loan. Once your loan posting is approved by Funding Wonder and posted on FundingWonder.com, we will charge a $500, one time Posting Fee. When your loan is funded, you will be charged a one time fee of 6% of the loan amount.









									Q: Are there charges for Failed Payments?								


When an automatic payment is rejected by the borrower’s bank, a Failed Payment Fee is charged to the borrower to cover the cost Funding Wonder incurs on the transaction. This could happen if there is insufficient balance in the borrower’s bank account, the bank account has been closed or the account is otherwise suspended. Each attempt to collect the monthly payment is considered a separate transaction, so a Failed Payment Fee may be assessed for each failed attempt. The amount of a Failed Payment Fee is $10.









									Q: Are there Late Payment Fees?								


When a borrower’s payment is late after a 15-day grace period, a Late Payment Fee is assessed on the 16th day to compensate investors for the delay. This fee is prorated and then passed on to the investors. The amount of a Late Payment Fee is the greater of 4.00% of the unpaid installment amount, or $10. This fee may be charged only once per late payment.





Loan Repayment





									Q: Can my business pay back a loan early?								


You may partially or fully prepay your loan at any time with no prepayment penalty or fee.  Paying down your principal early will reduce or eliminate future interest payments. A full prepayment of principal will pay off your loan and bring an end to your monthly payments. A partial prepayment does not reduce the amount of your monthly payment but does reduce the amount of interest you will pay during the life of your loan by allowing you to complete repayment of your loan earlier than the original maturity date (last payment due date).









									Q: How are loan repayments calculated?								


Loan repayments are calculated using the same formulas used by banks and other financial institutions, with the interest rate being applied as an Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) and not as a flat rate (if the interest rate were applied as a flat rate it would substantially increase your cost of financing). Monthly repayments will always be equal, consisting of interest payments and repayments of the outstanding principal of the loan. Each month the interest portion of the payment will typically go down and the principal portion will go up. The full repayment schedule for your loan can be seen at any time in the account section of Funding Wonder or in the Loan Contract.

Investing Tips




							While investing in small business loans may bring rewards, it also carries risks. These tips can help you determine if a crowdfunding offering is right for you.
						









								Ask yourself if you can handle the risk and the potential loss of your investment.
							


							Both are real possibilities when it comes to companies that issue securities using crowdfunding. The venture may not succeed. Small businesses can and do fail. You should be able to afford, and be prepared to lose, your entire investment. If you are risk-averse, are just starting to invest, have only a little money to invest, or may need the money in the short term, crowdfunding investments likely are not for you.
						








								Read and understand the educational and financial information, and all disclosures, provided by the issuer and Funding Wonder.
							


							If you are working with a financial professional, or seeking information over Funding Wonder's communication channel, ask direct questions about the investment, including worst-case scenarios. It's also a good idea to seek a second, or even third, opinion especially when it comes to highly speculative investments. This might include checking with an accountant who understands financial balance sheets and likely has no vested interest in the investment.
						








								Recognize that fraud is a possibility.
							


							As with all investment opportunities, the possibility of fraud is real. Protect yourself by understanding the tactics a fraudster might use—and how to avoid them. As noted above, check out investment professionals using BrokerCheck and go to FINRA's Funding Portals Web page. Under Regulation Crowdfunding, offerings must be conducted through a registered funding portal such as Funding Wonder. A basic Internet search is also valuable. Proceed with caution if you turn up legal or regulatory concerns about company officials, or news reports that raise other red flags.
						








								Revisit your financial goals.
							


							Setting clear, prioritized goals—each with steps to achieve the goal, a price tag and a time frame—will help guide your investment approach, including whether crowdfunding offerings have a place in your portfolio. Basic strategies such as asset allocation and diversification can help manage risk and make sound investment decisions.
						





Frequently Asked Questions





								Q: What is Regulation Crowdfunding?							


After the enactment of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, the SEC was tasked with adopting rules to facilitate capital raising by small businesses while providing significant investor protections. Regulation Crowdfunding or Regulation CF enables individuals to purchase securities in crowdfunding offerings subject to certain limits, requires companies to disclose certain information about their business and securities offering, and creates a regulatory framework for the intermediaries facilitating crowdfunding transactions.









								Q: Where is my money held?							


For each Loan, an escrow account will be set up to hold funds during the bidding process. This escrow account will be closed at the end of bidding with funds transferred either to the Company or returned to investors.









								Q: Do I have to be an accredited investor to invest on Funding Wonder?							


You must be 18 years or older and you will be subject to the rolling twelve month investment limitations of Regulation CF.









								Q: Are there any restrictions on my ability to transfer my investment?							


Any securities issued in an offering conducted under Regulation Crowdfunding are subject to a one-year restriction on transfer, unless such transfer is made: (i) to the issuer of the securities; (ii) to an accredited investor; (iii) as part of a registered offering; or (iv) to a family member of the purchaser or certain trusts. The promissory notes issued by companies using our funding portal may contain additional restrictions on transfer. Investments on Funding Wonder should be viewed as illiquid investments meaning you cannot sell the securities quickly and there may be no market for the investments when you are able to resell.









								Q: How much can I bid?							


You are subject to certain limitations to balance the risk that typically comes along with small business lending.  Specifically, SEC regulations limit the amount individual investors may invest across securities offered under Regulation CF over a trailing 12-month period.  The limitations are as follows:
If the investor’s annual income or net worth is less than $100,000, then an investor may invest the greater of:

$2,000 across all securities offered under Regulation CF over the trailing 12-month period and
5% of the lesser of their annual income or net worth across all securities offered under Regulation CF over the trailing 12-month period.

If the investor’s annual income and net worth are at least $100,000, then an investor may invest the lesser of:

10% of their annual income across all securities offered under Regulation CF over the trailing 12-month period and
10% of their net worth across all securities offered under Regulation CF over the trailing 12-month period.

Furthermore, for any 12-month period, the aggregate amount of securities sold to an investor through all crowdfunding offerings may not exceed $100,000.
The table below, which was provided by the SEC, provides examples of an individual investor’s aggregate investment limits in any 12-month period.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
