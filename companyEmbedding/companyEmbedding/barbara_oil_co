SHIPPING POLICIES

OilPaintings.com offers over 60,000 magnificent oil paintings for sale from our comprehensive website. When you place an order online or by telephone, all in-stock oil paintings are shipped from our facility within 48 hours. On the day your order is shipped, we will promptly contact you by e-mail with a tracking number and method of shipment. In the event we are temporarily out of stock on any of the oil paintings in your order, please allow approximately four to eight weeks for your oil paintings to be hand-painted by our artists and delivered directly to your home or office.

ORDERS SHIPPED TO DESTINATIONS IN THE USA

All orders shipped to destinations within the Continental USA enjoy FREE SHIPPING for framed or unframed oil paintings. Our shipping department will either ship your order by UPS, FedEx, U.S. Postal Service, or trucking company. Once your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number by e-mail, which enables you to easily track your shipment and be aware of the actual day your order will arrive to your door.

Please note that orders to states outside the Continental USA (Alaska and Hawaii) are subject to the same shipping policy that applies to international destinations.

ORDERS SHIPPED TO INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS

All orders shipped to international destinations enjoy FREE SHIPPING for unframed oil paintings rolled in a shipping tube. For any orders containing framed oil paintings and/or framed mirrors, OilPaintings.com will pay 50% of the shipping and handling charges. To determine your 50% co-pay, you may contact us in advance of placing your order for a shipping quotation, or if you prefer, a staff member from our shipping department will e-mail you the exact shipping and handling cost after you have placed your order. Once your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number by e-mail, which allows you to easily track your shipment and be aware of the actual day your order will arrive to your door.

Please note that international orders may be subject to customs charges, including import duties and taxes. These charges are the responsibility of the customer and are not included in our prices or shipping charges. When ordering from OilPaintings.com you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all the laws and regulations of the country where the goods are being received.

EXPEDITED ORDERS

Our shipping department offers our customers expedited shipping options at an additional charge, including overnight or 2 day delivery service. Please contact us by telephone or e-mail after you have placed your order and we can change the method of shipping to include your choice of expedited shipping. Please note that in the event we are temporarily out of stock on your oil paintings and you are in urgent need to receive your order as quickly as possible, we can elevate your order to “Priority Status” at a nominal fee. Please contact our Customer Service Department for more details.

ORDERS FOR FRAMED OIL PAINTINGS

When your order includes framed oil paintings, our professional framers carefully stretch each oil painting canvas onto wood stretcher bars and mount the oil painting into the frame of your choice. In addition, our framers install heavy-duty hanging hardware on the frame and supply you with gallery-quality hooks to nail into your walls. When you receive your shipment, simply take the framed oil paintings out of the box and hang them on your wall.

It is important to note that our extreme attention to detail in packing and shipping framed oil paintings is unparalleled in the art industry. Our customers regularly send us testimonials that include compliments on how professional their shipments were packed and boxed by our shipping staff. Please be assured that our expert shipping department uses only the latest packaging technology to make certain your shipment arrives to your door safe and most importantly, damage-free.

Art styles have evolved over the centuries from the Early Renaissance art style of the 13th century, to the Baroque art style of the 17th century, to the Impressionist art style of the 19th century, and to the Abstract Expressionism art style of the 20th century.

SHIPPING POLICIES

OilPaintings.com offers over 60,000 magnificent oil paintings for sale from our comprehensive website. When you place an order online or by telephone, all in-stock oil paintings are shipped from our facility within 48 hours. On the day your order is shipped, we will promptly contact you by e-mail with a tracking number and method of shipment. In the event we are temporarily out of stock on any of the oil paintings in your order, please allow approximately four to eight weeks for your oil paintings to be hand-painted by our artists and delivered directly to your home or office.

ORDERS SHIPPED TO DESTINATIONS IN THE USA

All orders shipped to destinations within the Continental USA enjoy FREE SHIPPING for framed or unframed oil paintings. Our shipping department will either ship your order by UPS, FedEx, U.S. Postal Service, or trucking company. Once your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number by e-mail, which enables you to easily track your shipment and be aware of the actual day your order will arrive to your door.

Please note that orders to states outside the Continental USA (Alaska and Hawaii) are subject to the same shipping policy that applies to international destinations.

ORDERS SHIPPED TO INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS

All orders shipped to international destinations enjoy FREE SHIPPING for unframed oil paintings rolled in a shipping tube. For any orders containing framed oil paintings and/or framed mirrors, OilPaintings.com will pay 50% of the shipping and handling charges. To determine your 50% co-pay, you may contact us in advance of placing your order for a shipping quotation, or if you prefer, a staff member from our shipping department will e-mail you the exact shipping and handling cost after you have placed your order. Once your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number by e-mail, which allows you to easily track your shipment and be aware of the actual day your order will arrive to your door.

Please note that international orders may be subject to customs charges, including import duties and taxes. These charges are the responsibility of the customer and are not included in our prices or shipping charges. When ordering from OilPaintings.com you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all the laws and regulations of the country where the goods are being received.

EXPEDITED ORDERS

Our shipping department offers our customers expedited shipping options at an additional charge, including overnight or 2 day delivery service. Please contact us by telephone or e-mail after you have placed your order and we can change the method of shipping to include your choice of expedited shipping. Please note that in the event we are temporarily out of stock on your oil paintings and you are in urgent need to receive your order as quickly as possible, we can elevate your order to “Priority Status” at a nominal fee. Please contact our Customer Service Department for more details.

ORDERS FOR FRAMED OIL PAINTINGS

When your order includes framed oil paintings, our professional framers carefully stretch each oil painting canvas onto wood stretcher bars and mount the oil painting into the frame of your choice. In addition, our framers install heavy-duty hanging hardware on the frame and supply you with gallery-quality hooks to nail into your walls. When you receive your shipment, simply take the framed oil paintings out of the box and hang them on your wall.

It is important to note that our extreme attention to detail in packing and shipping framed oil paintings is unparalleled in the art industry. Our customers regularly send us testimonials that include compliments on how professional their shipments were packed and boxed by our shipping staff. Please be assured that our expert shipping department uses only the latest packaging technology to make certain your shipment arrives to your door safe and most importantly, damage-free.

TRANSIT TIME FOR SHIPMENTS WITHIN THE USA

The maps of the USA shown below, illustrate the average transit time in “business days” for shipments made to destinations in the USA by FedEx Ground and UPS Ground. Please note that a business day does not include Saturday, Sunday, or holidays.

About Us






Bulk Apothecary was founded in mid 2010 as a small brick & mortar specialty retailer in Streetsboro, Ohio and has since grown to become one of the nation's largest online suppliers of natural ingredients and essential oils. Our main focus from the beginning was soap and candle making supplies, but word of our fantastic prices, amazing quality and excellent customer service spread.  Within 3 years, we expanded our offering to a wide range of specialty ingredients and vitamin supplements and had a dominant online presence that was growing by the day.  Today, we still operate our small store in Streetsboro, Ohio but also have an online presence that's growth is nothing short of amazing.  This growth has come from a strong focus on our 5 founding principles.

We source the finest quality ingredients and supplies from ethical producers around the world.
We supply all of our products at market leading prices with no gimmicks.
We never sacrifice quality for price.
The customer is always right and customers should always be treated the way our customer service reps would like to be treated.
Appreciate every customer, large and small and do your best to service them.

From our experience if you stick to your principles, the business will take care of itself. These beliefs have allowed us to do great things.
We now also have Nature's Oil line of products under our corporate umbrella.  Nature's Oil is a complete line of natural oils and supplements that can be found in your local health food, grocery, and craft store.
