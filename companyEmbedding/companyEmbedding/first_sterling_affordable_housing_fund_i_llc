BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regions Bank today announced it has acquired the Low Income Housing Tax 
      Credit (LIHTC) corporate fund syndication and asset management 
      businesses of First Sterling Financial, Inc. The acquisition complements 
      Regions’ Community Investment Capital, Real Estate and Capital Markets 
      capabilities to serve more clients and communities.
    


      First Sterling is one of the leading national syndicators of investment 
      funds benefiting from Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Since its founding 
      by Martin and Ann Soja more than 30 years ago, First Sterling has

      proprietary and multi-investor funds. This investor equity has been used 
      to support more than $3.5 billion of development in 700 properties 
      containing over 30,000 rental units in 45 states, Puerto Rico and 
      Washington, DC.
    

      “Regions has a long history of supporting affordable housing 
      developments that benefit communities through direct investment in Low 
      Income Housing Tax Credits,” said John Turner, head of Regions’ 
      Corporate Banking Group. “The addition of First Sterling’s 
      industry-leading syndication and asset management capabilities will 
      allow us to grow non-interest revenue and offer clients additional 
      solutions to meet the affordable housing needs of more communities.”
    

      Regions Bank is one of the nation’s largest participants in affordable 
      housing finance through the Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) 
      Program and provides comprehensive real estate corporate banking and 
      capital management services to meet the debt and capital needs of 
      developers and investors. Regions Bank is also a Fannie Mae DUS 
      Multifamily Affordable Lender and a HUD Tax Credit Pilot Program 
      Multifamily Lender.
    

      “On behalf of First Sterling, we are very excited about our firm 
      becoming part of Regions - we share similar corporate cultures, values 
      and goals,” said Martin Soja, Chairman and CEO, First Sterling.
    

      “We believe our combined commitment to the well-being of our employees 
      and dedication to our developers, investors and communities are 
      complementary and critical to success,” added Ann Soja, President, First 
      Sterling. “As part of Regions, we will capitalize on our expertise in 
      the acquisition and asset management of affordable housing and grow the 
      firm’s national syndication platforms.”
    

      Regions Bank will maintain First Sterling’s New York operations and all 
      of its employees. The financial terms of the agreement were not 
      disclosed. Beekman Advisors served as financial advisor to Regions Bank

National Housing Trust Fund









Housing the Lowest Income People
An Analysis of National Housing Trust Fund Draft Allocation Plans

Housing the Lowest Income People is a summary of key features identified in the 51 draft national Housing Trust Fund (HTF) Allocation Plans that states and the District of Columbia are required to submit to HUD. Click here to download the report (PDF)

The national Housing Trust Fund (HTF) is the first new housing resource since 1974 targeted to building, rehabilitating, preserving, and operating rental housing for extremely low income people.
NLIHC, its members, and other stakeholders played a critical role in the creation of the Housing Trust Fund through the passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.
In 2016, the first $174 million in HTF dollars were allocated to states. In 2017, $219 million is available. These initial allocations are important steps, but far more resources are needed.
NLIHC leads the Housing Trust Fund Implementation and Policy Group, a coalition of national advocates committed to protecting and expanding this new resource. NLIHC works with stakeholders to build Congressional support to increase funding for the HTF through tax reform, housing finance reform, investments in infrastructure, and other legislative opportunities.

From 2004 through 2008, Mr. Wambua was Senior Policy Advisor for the New York City Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Daniel Doctoroff, where he coordinated and oversaw a citywide portfolio of economic development agencies, boards and commissions, as well as oversaw all economic development initiatives within the Bronx and Upper Manhattan.
Mr. Wambua earned a B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley and a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

New York Housing Conference (NYHC) was established in 1973 by Clara Fox, an icon in the affordable housing industry. The organization, formed to protest the Nixon housing moratorium, was co-chaired in by Nancy Le Blanc of Mobilization for Youth. Originally known as the Coalition to Save Housing, the name was changed three years later to New York Housing Conference, and the coalition affiliated with the National Housing Conference to strengthen NYHC’s capacity to advocate for affordable housing policy in the nation’s capital.
In response to the federal government’s retreat from urban housing programs in 1970s, NYHC initially focused on bringing attention to the need for expanded federal housing programs, the preservation of public and private affordable housing developments, and additional investment in government-assisted housing and community development. NYHC has long engaged in education efforts related to the impact of federal housing program changes on the housing needs of New Yorkers.
NYHC’s long history includes advocating for New York City’s low- and middle-income households. In the late 1970s, Clara Fox, in her capacity as Executive Director of Settlement Housing Fund, led the rescue of Manhattan Plaza, the 1688-unit development for performing artists that began the revitalization of Times Square.
After the Reagan Administration ended, support for new construction and substantial rehabilitation, NYHC began to focus on local solutions. NYHC became an effective leader on the local level by playing a major role in supporting Mayor Koch’s 10-year, $5 billion Capital Spending Plan, and by providing critical education in advancing his Housing New York legislation. At the onset of the Bloomberg administration, NYHC presented a review of city housing programs to the Mayor, recommending measures to expand and preserve the city’s affordable housing stock. Many of NYHC’s recommendations were incorporated into the Mayor’s groundbreaking New Housing Marketplace Plan, which he later unveiled at NYHC/NHC’s Annual Awards Luncheon, a premier industry event for networking and housing policy discussion in New York State. The program met with immediate success and was eventually expanded to 165,000 units over 10 years. NYHC was also included in Mayor de Blasio’s Housing Plan Implementation Advisory Board providing input in his ambitious 200,000-unit affordable initiative.
NYHC has effectively maintained a statewide presence over the years. NYHC developed and co-sponsored New York’s first conference on Housing and Environmental Regulation. NYHC has proposed and advocated for major state-wide multi-year housing programs to preserve and revitalize communities, stimulate additional private investment, retain and attract a skilled workforce, create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in economic activity. It has consistently worked to advance the call for affordable housing statewide through coalition building at the grassroots level as well as in partnership with other housing organizations.
After the passing of Clara Fox in 2007, NYHC undertook a structured reorganization under Judy Calogero, incorporating as a 501c3, implementing an education program for housing professionals and creating the Young Leadership Council which offers education, networking and advocacy opportunities to the emerging leaders working in the affordable housing community.
Under the current leadership of Executive Director Rachel Fee, NYHC is reinvigorating its policy presence at city, state and federal level by expanding its advisory board, creating active communication and programs to engage stakeholders and implementing top policy priorities with primary focus on budget advocacy.


To advance City, State and Federal policies and funding to support the development and preservation of decent and affordable housing for all New Yorkers.
NYHC is a nonprofit affordable housing policy and advocacy organization.  We support decent affordable housing for all New Yorkers. We analyze public policy, educate and convene stakeholders and raise public awareness regarding New York’s need for affordable housing. We are a broad-based coalition comprised of a balanced mix of nonprofit and private developers, owners, managers, professionals, and funders of affordable housing.
