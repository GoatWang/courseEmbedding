HOUSTON, May 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Columbia Pipeline Partners LP (NYSE: CPPL) ("CPPL"), a NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) company, today provided its average distribution growth outlook through 2020.  Subject to the key assumptions described below, CPPL expects to offer unitholders an average annual distribution growth rate of approximately 20 percent.  
"With approximately $8 billion in capital being deployed over the next several years at Columbia Pipeline Group, we plan to create value for CPPL unitholders through transparent and long-term distribution growth," 
Robert C. Skaggs Jr
., chairman and chief executive officer of CPPL said. "Most of this investment is supported by long-term, fee-based, take-or-pay contracts." 
CPPL's minimum quarterly distribution is $0.1675 per unit, or $0.67 per unit annually. On April 29, CPPL announced its initial prorated quarterly distribution of $0.0912 per unit to both common and subordinated unitholders, which covered the portion of the first quarter 2015 between the day following the close of the initial public offering on February 11, 2015, and March 31, 2015.  
CPPL's business and operations are conducted through its 15.7 percent interest in CPG OpCo LP and its subsidiaries, which own and operate substantially all of the natural gas transmission, storage and midstream assets of NiSource Inc.'s Columbia Pipeline Group (CPG) unit.  
Columbia Pipeline Group outlines post-separation performance outlook through 2020
In a NiSource press release issued this morning, CPG outlined its post-separation business strategy and growth outlook, which included among other things, that the expected net investment in CPG OpCo's pipeline, storage and midstream assets is expected to grow from approximately $4.6 billion at the beginning of 2015 to approximately $13.5 billion at year-end 2020. Total capital expenditures from 2016 to 2020 are expected to reach approximately $8.4 billion, of which approximately $4 billion is planned to be funded by the issuance of CPPL equity. Total capital expenditures include maintenance capital of approximately $135 million a year.
The committed project inventory is expected to deliver CPG EBITDA (non-GAAP) of approximately $680 million, excluding separation costs, in 2015, with an average annual growth rate of approximately 20 percent through 2020. For a reconciliation of CPG's EBITDA outlook to GAAP for 2015, please see the CPPL Form 8K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 14, 2015.
CPG post-separation performance outlook webcast scheduled for today
CPG's executive team will provide an overview of CPG's business strategy, highlighting its growth and infrastructure investment inventory, today at 10:30 a.m. - noon ET. A webcast of the event with accompanying presentations will be available at www.nisource.com. The webcast also will be archived at the NiSource website.

The project will provide up to 2.7 MMDth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Gulf XPress. Gulf XPress will provide 860,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity for Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system. This project involves an investment of approximately $0.7 billion and is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Central Virginia Connector. This project will provide 45,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system to a new point of delivery in Virginia. This approximately $13 million project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Millennium Eastern System Upgrade. We intend to invest approximately $135 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to expand eastward flow capacity by 223,000 Dth/d to Ramapo and other nearby points on the system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Table of Contents  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP  In 2013, the FERC approved the modernization settlement entered into by Columbia Gas Transmission and its customers that provides recovery and return on an investment of up to $1.5 billion over a five-year period to modernize its system to improve system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. The modernization program includes, among other things, replacement of aging pipeline and compressor facilities, enhancements to system inspection capabilities and improvements in control systems. Columbia Gas Transmission placed approximately $320 million in modernization investments into service during 2015. In January 2016, the FERC approved Columbia Gas Transmission's third annual filing for recovery of the revenue requirement under this program. In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC's approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional $1.1 billion over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. Items Affecting Comparability of our Financial Results The historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the following reasons:   Upon the closing of CPPL's IPO, short-term borrowings-affiliated and a portion of the long-term debt-affiliated (including current portion of long-term debt-affiliated) have been transferred to an affiliate of CPG and the related interest expense is no longer being incurred.   We are a limited partnership treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, are not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. We are subject to state and local income taxes in certain jurisdictions. The Predecessor's tax expense was determined on a separate return basis. Accordingly, we expect our tax expense to be significantly reduced subsequent to CPPL's IPO as compared to that of the Predecessor.   We incurred additional costs as a result of the Merger. We incurred $110.4 million of Merger related costs within operation and maintenance and property and other taxes, including employee related expenses of $101.3 million. Additionally we incurred a Merger related impairment charge of $11.9 million. These costs are included in "Operation and maintenance" and "Impairment of long-lived assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited).  Table of Contents  ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP  Operating Expenses. Operating expenses were $326.8 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $134.8 million from the same period in 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to the Merger of $110.4 million, decreased gains on the sale of assets of $29.2 million, primarily due to conveyances of mineral interests, higher impairment charges of $11.3 million due to the cancellation of IT system upgrades and . . .

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP  system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. The modernization program includes, among other things, replacement of aging pipeline and compressor facilities, enhancements to system inspection capabilities and improvements in control systems. Columbia Gas Transmission placed approximately $320 million in modernization investments into service during 2015. In January 2016, the FERC approved Columbia Gas Transmission's third annual filing for recovery of the revenue requirement under this program. In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC's approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional $1.1 billion over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. Items Affecting Comparability of our Financial Results The historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the following reasons:   Upon the closing of CPPL's IPO, short-term borrowings-affiliated and a portion of the long-term debt-affiliated (including current portion of long-term debt-affiliated) have been transferred to an affiliate of CPG and the related interest expense is no longer being incurred.   We are a limited partnership treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, are not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. We are subject to state and local income taxes in certain jurisdictions. The Predecessor's tax expense was determined on a separate return basis. Accordingly, we expect our tax expense to be significantly reduced subsequent to CPPL's IPO as compared to that of the Predecessor.  Table of Contents  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP Results of Operations Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 The following schedule presents our historical consolidated and combined key operating and financial metrics.

Operating revenues were $313.2 million for the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.4 million from the same period in 2015. The decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $31.7 million attributable to the recovery of operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, which are offset in expense, and lower mineral rights royalty revenue of $4.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher demand revenue of $33.0 million largely from the East Side Expansion and Rayne XPress growth projects, and the CCRM. Additionally, there were increased shorter term transportation services of $3.3 million.  Table of Contents  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP  Operating Expenses. Operating expenses were $199.1 million for the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of $21.0 million from the same period in 2015. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to $31.7 million of decreased operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, recoveries of which are offset in operating revenues. This decrease was partially offset by decreased gains on the conveyances of mineral interests of $4.9 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $4.7 million primarily due to higher levels of in-service assets and increased employee and administrative expenses of $2.0 million.
