Overview



Company Profile

Rightscorp (OTCQB: RIHT) is a leading provider of monetization services for artists and holders of copyrighted Intellectual Property (IP). The Company's patent pending digital loss prevention technology focuses on the infringement of digital content such as music, movies, software, and games and ensures that owners and creators are rightfully paid for their IP. Rightscorp implements existing laws to solve copyright infringements by collecting payments from illegal file sharing activities via notifications sent through Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company's technology identifies copyright infringers, who are offered a reasonable settlement option when compared to the legal liability defined in the Digital Millennium Copyrights Act (DMCA). Based on the fact that 24% of all Internet traffic is used to distribute copyrighted content without permission or compensation to the creators, Rightscorp is pursuing an estimated $2.3 billion opportunity and has monetized major media titles through relationships with industry leaders.

Rightscorp, Inc. (formerly DigitalRights) is a Los Angeles-based copyright enforcement company which locates alleged copyright violators and collects money from legal damages and out of court settlements on behalf of the copyright holder.[1] Rightscorp manages copyrights of videos, music, and video games.[2]

(February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Clients[edit]
Rightscorp represents music, movie and print publishers. In May 2014, Rightscorp reached 1.5 million copyrights being managed,[3] including those held by Warner Bros.[4][5] The company manages copyrights for over 800 feature films,[6] including 14 movie titles with gross sales over $3.5 billion.[7]
Rightscorp works with music interests such as BMG Rights Management, which represents such musicians as David Bowie, Kings of Leon, and Will.i.am and is a member of the American Association of Independent Music[8][9][10] The company represents more than 13,000 copyrights held by Blue Pie Productions[11] and metal/hardcore label Rotten Records.[12] During the week of 24 February 2013, the company was also monitoring 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.[13]
Monitoring[edit]
Rightcorp utilizes crawlers, which according to Steele and CEO Christopher Sabec, crawls Bittorrent file-sharing sites and finds seeders and their IP addresses over time. Though the company has the seeders’ IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders.[5] Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.[14]
In response to mobile streaming apps such as Meerkat, Periscope and Popcorn Time, the company has also announced a "Streaming Rights Monitoring" service in May 2015, which the Rightscorp claims will be able to continuously monitor for streaming of copyrighted material on mobile streaming networks.[15]
Notice forwarding[edit]
After determining the target IP address, Rightscorp requests that the Internet service provider for that address forward a notice of infringement to the user.[16] The subscribers of more than American 70 ISPs have paid settlements to the company, including Charter Communications, CenturyLink and others.[3][4] Rightscorp COO Robert Steele told Ars Technica that more ISPs are forwarding their notices each month.[5][17] According to the company, over 200 ISPs are participating with Rightscorp as of November 2014.[18]
However, ISPs do not always choose to comply with the request to forward notices. As of November 2014, music publishers BMG and Round Hill are suing Cox Communications for not terminating the accounts of users identified by Rightscorp as being allegedly repeat downloaders.[19] In May 2015, Rightscorp filed suit against two Comcast users for downloading two albums, including Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops and D.R.I.'s Definition. The company claims one of the downloaders ignored 11 notices, the other, 288. Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work.[20][21][22]
Settlements and disconnections[edit]
In the notice of infringement, the Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee (around $10 to $20 USD per violation) or facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law.[5][9][23] After collection, Rightscorp’s settlements are split 50/50 with its clients.[5]
The company compares its settlement option of $20 per alleged infringement to a traffic ticket, calling it a "socially fair way to create a deterrent."[5] Even though the notice works as a settlement offer, the notice is not in itself enforceable by law and the liability of the infringed offender has to be determined by a civil court.
If the user chooses not to pay and is repeatedly alleged of violated copyright infringements, the ISP may suspend or terminate the subscriber account until a settlement is reached.[8] TorrentFreak claimed in 2011 that more than 200,000 Bittorrent users were in some stage of a lawsuit for alleged copyright infringement.[24] The company also announced that it has closed more than 75,000 cases of online copyright infringement.[17][25]
Lawsuits[edit]
Class Action Lawsuit[edit]
On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon.[26] The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California’s Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h).[27] Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case. After locating replacement plaintiffs, he refiled the suit, but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it. Subsequently, one of Mr Pietz's two surviving claims was stricken by the Court, and in the process, legal fees were awarded against Mr Pietz's client. At approximately the same time, over Mr Pietz's objections, the Court dismissed Mr Harmon (whom Mr Pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of Rightscorp) from the case.
On May 12, 2015, a federal court ordered John Blaha, represented by Pietz, to pay attorney’s fees in John Blaha v. Rightscorp. Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas. Rightscorp countered that suing on those grounds were a violation of the first amendment and subject to California’s anti-SLAPP laws. The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.)[28][29]
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit[edit]
On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations.[30]
Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs’ cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[31]
BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications[edit]
On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to "reasonably implement" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's "safe harbor" provision did not apply.[32][33][34][35]
In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations.[36] The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.[37]
Finances[edit]
In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT.[8] In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada[38] and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe.[39] On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings.[40] The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011.[40]
In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000.[41]
Security Breach[edit]
Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014.[42] Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films.[42]
Criticism[edit]
Issues have been raised with regard to Rightscorp's practices. Several court cases have ruled that Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas do not require internet service providers (ISPs) to identify their users to the issuer of the subpoena; indeed, an ISP that does provide that information can face sanctions, as can the issuer of the subpoena.[43] The notice sent by Rightscorp prevents a lawsuit for the specific download in the notice; however, because of the language in the notice, paying the settlement is an admission of guilt. Although Rightscorp is then unable to sue for that infringement, not only can they sue and press charges for subsequent downloads, but they have the original settlement as admission of guilt of previous infringement.
Comcast, the largest internet provider in the United States,[44] has continually refused to forward Rightscorp's DMCA settlement notices in the form in which Rightscorp sends them.[12] Comcast removes the threatening language and the settlement offer and instead simply forwards a letter to their customer that basically reads as an incident report.[45]

Clients[edit]
Rightscorp represents music, movie and print publishers. In May 2014, Rightscorp reached 1.5 million copyrights being managed,[3] including those held by Warner Bros.[4][5] The company manages copyrights for over 800 feature films,[6] including 14 movie titles with gross sales over $3.5 billion.[7]
Rightscorp works with music interests such as BMG Rights Management, which represents such musicians as David Bowie, Kings of Leon, and Will.i.am and is a member of the American Association of Independent Music[8][9][10] The company represents more than 13,000 copyrights held by Blue Pie Productions[11] and metal/hardcore label Rotten Records.[12] During the week of 24 February 2013, the company was also monitoring 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.[13]
Monitoring[edit]
Rightcorp utilizes crawlers, which according to Steele and CEO Christopher Sabec, crawls Bittorrent file-sharing sites and finds seeders and their IP addresses over time. Though the company has the seeders’ IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders.[5] Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.[14]
In response to mobile streaming apps such as Meerkat, Periscope and Popcorn Time, the company has also announced a "Streaming Rights Monitoring" service in May 2015, which the Rightscorp claims will be able to continuously monitor for streaming of copyrighted material on mobile streaming networks.[15]
Notice forwarding[edit]
After determining the target IP address, Rightscorp requests that the Internet service provider for that address forward a notice of infringement to the user.[16] The subscribers of more than American 70 ISPs have paid settlements to the company, including Charter Communications, CenturyLink and others.[3][4] Rightscorp COO Robert Steele told Ars Technica that more ISPs are forwarding their notices each month.[5][17] According to the company, over 200 ISPs are participating with Rightscorp as of November 2014.[18]
However, ISPs do not always choose to comply with the request to forward notices. As of November 2014, music publishers BMG and Round Hill are suing Cox Communications for not terminating the accounts of users identified by Rightscorp as being allegedly repeat downloaders.[19] In May 2015, Rightscorp filed suit against two Comcast users for downloading two albums, including Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops and D.R.I.'s Definition. The company claims one of the downloaders ignored 11 notices, the other, 288. Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work.[20][21][22]
Settlements and disconnections[edit]
In the notice of infringement, the Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee (around $10 to $20 USD per violation) or facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law.[5][9][23] After collection, Rightscorp’s settlements are split 50/50 with its clients.[5]
The company compares its settlement option of $20 per alleged infringement to a traffic ticket, calling it a "socially fair way to create a deterrent."[5] Even though the notice works as a settlement offer, the notice is not in itself enforceable by law and the liability of the infringed offender has to be determined by a civil court.
If the user chooses not to pay and is repeatedly alleged of violated copyright infringements, the ISP may suspend or terminate the subscriber account until a settlement is reached.[8] TorrentFreak claimed in 2011 that more than 200,000 Bittorrent users were in some stage of a lawsuit for alleged copyright infringement.[24] The company also announced that it has closed more than 75,000 cases of online copyright infringement.[17][25]
Lawsuits[edit]
Class Action Lawsuit[edit]
On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon.[26] The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California’s Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h).[27] Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case. After locating replacement plaintiffs, he refiled the suit, but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it. Subsequently, one of Mr Pietz's two surviving claims was stricken by the Court, and in the process, legal fees were awarded against Mr Pietz's client. At approximately the same time, over Mr Pietz's objections, the Court dismissed Mr Harmon (whom Mr Pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of Rightscorp) from the case.
On May 12, 2015, a federal court ordered John Blaha, represented by Pietz, to pay attorney’s fees in John Blaha v. Rightscorp. Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas. Rightscorp countered that suing on those grounds were a violation of the first amendment and subject to California’s anti-SLAPP laws. The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.)[28][29]
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit[edit]
On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations.[30]
Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs’ cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[31]
BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications[edit]
On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to "reasonably implement" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's "safe harbor" provision did not apply.[32][33][34][35]
In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations.[36] The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.[37]
Finances[edit]
In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT.[8] In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada[38] and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe.[39] On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings.[40] The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011.[40]
In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000.[41]
Security Breach[edit]
Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014.[42] Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films.[42]

Clients[edit]
Rightscorp represents music, movie and print publishers. In May 2014, Rightscorp reached 1.5 million copyrights being managed,[3] including those held by Warner Bros.[4][5] The company manages copyrights for over 800 feature films,[6] including 14 movie titles with gross sales over $3.5 billion.[7]
Rightscorp works with music interests such as BMG Rights Management, which represents such musicians as David Bowie, Kings of Leon, and Will.i.am and is a member of the American Association of Independent Music[8][9][10] The company represents more than 13,000 copyrights held by Blue Pie Productions[11] and metal/hardcore label Rotten Records.[12] During the week of 24 February 2013, the company was also monitoring 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.[13]
Monitoring[edit]
Rightcorp utilizes crawlers, which according to Steele and CEO Christopher Sabec, crawls Bittorrent file-sharing sites and finds seeders and their IP addresses over time. Though the company has the seeders’ IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders.[5] Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.[14]
In response to mobile streaming apps such as Meerkat, Periscope and Popcorn Time, the company has also announced a "Streaming Rights Monitoring" service in May 2015, which the Rightscorp claims will be able to continuously monitor for streaming of copyrighted material on mobile streaming networks.[15]
Notice forwarding[edit]
After determining the target IP address, Rightscorp requests that the Internet service provider for that address forward a notice of infringement to the user.[16] The subscribers of more than American 70 ISPs have paid settlements to the company, including Charter Communications, CenturyLink and others.[3][4] Rightscorp COO Robert Steele told Ars Technica that more ISPs are forwarding their notices each month.[5][17] According to the company, over 200 ISPs are participating with Rightscorp as of November 2014.[18]
However, ISPs do not always choose to comply with the request to forward notices. As of November 2014, music publishers BMG and Round Hill are suing Cox Communications for not terminating the accounts of users identified by Rightscorp as being allegedly repeat downloaders.[19] In May 2015, Rightscorp filed suit against two Comcast users for downloading two albums, including Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops and D.R.I.'s Definition. The company claims one of the downloaders ignored 11 notices, the other, 288. Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work.[20][21][22]
Settlements and disconnections[edit]
In the notice of infringement, the Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee (around $10 to $20 USD per violation) or facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law.[5][9][23] After collection, Rightscorp’s settlements are split 50/50 with its clients.[5]
The company compares its settlement option of $20 per alleged infringement to a traffic ticket, calling it a "socially fair way to create a deterrent."[5] Even though the notice works as a settlement offer, the notice is not in itself enforceable by law and the liability of the infringed offender has to be determined by a civil court.
If the user chooses not to pay and is repeatedly alleged of violated copyright infringements, the ISP may suspend or terminate the subscriber account until a settlement is reached.[8] TorrentFreak claimed in 2011 that more than 200,000 Bittorrent users were in some stage of a lawsuit for alleged copyright infringement.[24] The company also announced that it has closed more than 75,000 cases of online copyright infringement.[17][25]
Lawsuits[edit]
Class Action Lawsuit[edit]
On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon.[26] The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California’s Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h).[27] Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case. After locating replacement plaintiffs, he refiled the suit, but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it. Subsequently, one of Mr Pietz's two surviving claims was stricken by the Court, and in the process, legal fees were awarded against Mr Pietz's client. At approximately the same time, over Mr Pietz's objections, the Court dismissed Mr Harmon (whom Mr Pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of Rightscorp) from the case.
On May 12, 2015, a federal court ordered John Blaha, represented by Pietz, to pay attorney’s fees in John Blaha v. Rightscorp. Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas. Rightscorp countered that suing on those grounds were a violation of the first amendment and subject to California’s anti-SLAPP laws. The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.)[28][29]
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit[edit]
On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations.[30]
Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs’ cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[31]
BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications[edit]
On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to "reasonably implement" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's "safe harbor" provision did not apply.[32][33][34][35]
In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations.[36] The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.[37]
Finances[edit]
In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT.[8] In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada[38] and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe.[39] On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings.[40] The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011.[40]
In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000.[41]
Security Breach[edit]
Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014.[42] Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films.[42]
Criticism[edit]
Issues have been raised with regard to Rightscorp's practices. Several court cases have ruled that Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas do not require internet service providers (ISPs) to identify their users to the issuer of the subpoena; indeed, an ISP that does provide that information can face sanctions, as can the issuer of the subpoena.[43] The notice sent by Rightscorp prevents a lawsuit for the specific download in the notice; however, because of the language in the notice, paying the settlement is an admission of guilt. Although Rightscorp is then unable to sue for that infringement, not only can they sue and press charges for subsequent downloads, but they have the original settlement as admission of guilt of previous infringement.
Comcast, the largest internet provider in the United States,[44] has continually refused to forward Rightscorp's DMCA settlement notices in the form in which Rightscorp sends them.[12] Comcast removes the threatening language and the settlement offer and instead simply forwards a letter to their customer that basically reads as an incident report.[45]

Though the company has the seeders’ IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders.[5] Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.[14]
In response to mobile streaming apps such as Meerkat, Periscope and Popcorn Time, the company has also announced a "Streaming Rights Monitoring" service in May 2015, which the Rightscorp claims will be able to continuously monitor for streaming of copyrighted material on mobile streaming networks.[15]
Notice forwarding[edit]
After determining the target IP address, Rightscorp requests that the Internet service provider for that address forward a notice of infringement to the user.[16] The subscribers of more than American 70 ISPs have paid settlements to the company, including Charter Communications, CenturyLink and others.[3][4] Rightscorp COO Robert Steele told Ars Technica that more ISPs are forwarding their notices each month.[5][17] According to the company, over 200 ISPs are participating with Rightscorp as of November 2014.[18]
However, ISPs do not always choose to comply with the request to forward notices. As of November 2014, music publishers BMG and Round Hill are suing Cox Communications for not terminating the accounts of users identified by Rightscorp as being allegedly repeat downloaders.[19] In May 2015, Rightscorp filed suit against two Comcast users for downloading two albums, including Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops and D.R.I.'s Definition. The company claims one of the downloaders ignored 11 notices, the other, 288. Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work.[20][21][22]
Settlements and disconnections[edit]
In the notice of infringement, the Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee (around $10 to $20 USD per violation) or facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law.[5][9][23] After collection, Rightscorp’s settlements are split 50/50 with its clients.[5]
The company compares its settlement option of $20 per alleged infringement to a traffic ticket, calling it a "socially fair way to create a deterrent."[5] Even though the notice works as a settlement offer, the notice is not in itself enforceable by law and the liability of the infringed offender has to be determined by a civil court.
If the user chooses not to pay and is repeatedly alleged of violated copyright infringements, the ISP may suspend or terminate the subscriber account until a settlement is reached.[8] TorrentFreak claimed in 2011 that more than 200,000 Bittorrent users were in some stage of a lawsuit for alleged copyright infringement.[24] The company also announced that it has closed more than 75,000 cases of online copyright infringement.[17][25]
Lawsuits[edit]
Class Action Lawsuit[edit]
On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon.[26] The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California’s Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h).[27] Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case. After locating replacement plaintiffs, he refiled the suit, but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it. Subsequently, one of Mr Pietz's two surviving claims was stricken by the Court, and in the process, legal fees were awarded against Mr Pietz's client. At approximately the same time, over Mr Pietz's objections, the Court dismissed Mr Harmon (whom Mr Pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of Rightscorp) from the case.
On May 12, 2015, a federal court ordered John Blaha, represented by Pietz, to pay attorney’s fees in John Blaha v. Rightscorp. Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas. Rightscorp countered that suing on those grounds were a violation of the first amendment and subject to California’s anti-SLAPP laws. The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.)[28][29]
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit[edit]
On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations.[30]
Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs’ cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[31]
BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications[edit]
On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to "reasonably implement" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's "safe harbor" provision did not apply.[32][33][34][35]
In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations.[36] The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.[37]
Finances[edit]
In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT.[8] In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada[38] and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe.[39] On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings.[40] The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011.[40]
In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000.[41]
Security Breach[edit]
Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014.[42] Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films.[42]
Criticism[edit]
Issues have been raised with regard to Rightscorp's practices. Several court cases have ruled that Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas do not require internet service providers (ISPs) to identify their users to the issuer of the subpoena; indeed, an ISP that does provide that information can face sanctions, as can the issuer of the subpoena.[43] The notice sent by Rightscorp prevents a lawsuit for the specific download in the notice; however, because of the language in the notice, paying the settlement is an admission of guilt. Although Rightscorp is then unable to sue for that infringement, not only can they sue and press charges for subsequent downloads, but they have the original settlement as admission of guilt of previous infringement.
Comcast, the largest internet provider in the United States,[44] has continually refused to forward Rightscorp's DMCA settlement notices in the form in which Rightscorp sends them.[12] Comcast removes the threatening language and the settlement offer and instead simply forwards a letter to their customer that basically reads as an incident report.[45]

Clients[edit]
Rightscorp represents music, movie and print publishers. In May 2014, Rightscorp reached 1.5 million copyrights being managed,[3] including those held by Warner Bros.[4][5] The company manages copyrights for over 800 feature films,[6] including 14 movie titles with gross sales over $3.5 billion.[7]
Rightscorp works with music interests such as BMG Rights Management, which represents such musicians as David Bowie, Kings of Leon, and Will.i.am and is a member of the American Association of Independent Music[8][9][10] The company represents more than 13,000 copyrights held by Blue Pie Productions[11] and metal/hardcore label Rotten Records.[12] During the week of 24 February 2013, the company was also monitoring 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.[13]
Monitoring[edit]
Rightcorp utilizes crawlers, which according to Steele and CEO Christopher Sabec, crawls Bittorrent file-sharing sites and finds seeders and their IP addresses over time. Though the company has the seeders’ IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders.[5] Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.[14]

Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work.[20][21][22]

Lawsuits[edit]
Class Action Lawsuit[edit]
On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon.[26] The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California’s Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h).[27] Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case.

Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas.

The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.)[28][29]
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit[edit]
On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations.[30]
Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs’ cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[31]
BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications[edit]
On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to "reasonably implement" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's "safe harbor" provision did not apply.[32][33][34][35]
In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations.[36] The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.[37]

In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT.[8] In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada[38] and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe.[39] On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings.[40] The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011.[40]
In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000.[41]
Security Breach[edit]
Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014.[42] Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films.[42]

Clients[edit]
Rightscorp represents music, movie and print publishers. In May 2014, Rightscorp reached 1.5 million copyrights being managed,[3] including those held by Warner Bros.[4][5] The company manages copyrights for over 800 feature films,[6] including 14 movie titles with gross sales over $3.5 billion.[7]
Rightscorp works with music interests such as BMG Rights Management, which represents such musicians as David Bowie, Kings of Leon, and Will.i.am and is a member of the American Association of Independent Music[8][9][10] The company represents more than 13,000 copyrights held by Blue Pie Productions[11] and metal/hardcore label Rotten Records.[12] During the week of 24 February 2013, the company was also monitoring 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.[13]
Monitoring[edit]
Rightcorp utilizes crawlers, which according to Steele and CEO Christopher Sabec, crawls Bittorrent file-sharing sites and finds seeders and their IP addresses over time. Though the company has the seeders’ IP addresses, it requires the ISPs to connect their notices to the seeders.[5] Sabec also says the company can discriminate between actual piracy and unauthorized internet access, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.[14]
In response to mobile streaming apps such as Meerkat, Periscope and Popcorn Time, the company has also announced a "Streaming Rights Monitoring" service in May 2015, which the Rightscorp claims will be able to continuously monitor for streaming of copyrighted material on mobile streaming networks.[15]
Notice forwarding[edit]
After determining the target IP address, Rightscorp requests that the Internet service provider for that address forward a notice of infringement to the user.[16] The subscribers of more than American 70 ISPs have paid settlements to the company, including Charter Communications, CenturyLink and others.[3][4] Rightscorp COO Robert Steele told Ars Technica that more ISPs are forwarding their notices each month.[5][17] According to the company, over 200 ISPs are participating with Rightscorp as of November 2014.[18]
However, ISPs do not always choose to comply with the request to forward notices. As of November 2014, music publishers BMG and Round Hill are suing Cox Communications for not terminating the accounts of users identified by Rightscorp as being allegedly repeat downloaders.[19] In May 2015, Rightscorp filed suit against two Comcast users for downloading two albums, including Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops and D.R.I.'s Definition. The company claims one of the downloaders ignored 11 notices, the other, 288. Rotten Records, through Rightscorp, is demanding an injunction against further infringement, deletion of the files and a fine of $150,000 per work.[20][21][22]
Settlements and disconnections[edit]
In the notice of infringement, the Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee (around $10 to $20 USD per violation) or facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law.[5][9][23] After collection, Rightscorp’s settlements are split 50/50 with its clients.[5]
The company compares its settlement option of $20 per alleged infringement to a traffic ticket, calling it a "socially fair way to create a deterrent."[5] Even though the notice works as a settlement offer, the notice is not in itself enforceable by law and the liability of the infringed offender has to be determined by a civil court.
If the user chooses not to pay and is repeatedly alleged of violated copyright infringements, the ISP may suspend or terminate the subscriber account until a settlement is reached.[8] TorrentFreak claimed in 2011 that more than 200,000 Bittorrent users were in some stage of a lawsuit for alleged copyright infringement.[24] The company also announced that it has closed more than 75,000 cases of online copyright infringement.[17][25]
Lawsuits[edit]
Class Action Lawsuit[edit]
On November 21, 2014 Morgan Pietz of The Pietz Law Firm, together with Drew Pomerance of Roxborough, Pomerance, Nye & Adreani filed a Class Action Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc, various John Does, and its owners, Christopher Sabec, Robert Steele, and outside legal counsel, Craig Harmon.[26] The complaint seeks class certification against Rightscorp for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, California’s Rosenthal Act, and Abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special DMCA subpoenas, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h).[27] Mr. Pietz's original plaintiff withdrew from the case. After locating replacement plaintiffs, he refiled the suit, but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it. Subsequently, one of Mr Pietz's two surviving claims was stricken by the Court, and in the process, legal fees were awarded against Mr Pietz's client. At approximately the same time, over Mr Pietz's objections, the Court dismissed Mr Harmon (whom Mr Pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of Rightscorp) from the case.
On May 12, 2015, a federal court ordered John Blaha, represented by Pietz, to pay attorney’s fees in John Blaha v. Rightscorp. Pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action; he asserted Rightscorp, on behalf of Warner Bros and BMG Rights Management, abused the judicial system by issuing 142 DMCA subpoenas. Rightscorp countered that suing on those grounds were a violation of the first amendment and subject to California’s anti-SLAPP laws. The judge sided with Rightscorp (though it still faces an allegation that it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making automated calls in to demand settlements.)[28][29]
Telephone Consumer Protection Act Lawsuit[edit]
On February 17, 2015 Plaintiffs Melissa Brown and Ben Jenkins represented by Attorney Sergei Lemberg of Lemberg Law LLC filed a Lawsuit against Rightscorp Inc and its Clients named as John Does 1-10 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for Telephone Consumer Protection Act abuses and other violations.[30]
Brown and Jenkins claim that Rightscorp Inc and its Clients violated America’s Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending automated calls and text messages in their general direction without permission. Evidence shows that Jenkins sent Rightscorp Inc numerous emails instructing Rightscorp Inc to cease their calls, text messages, emails and letter solicitations to him and Brown. Regardless, Rightscorp Inc continued to place calls and text messages to the Plaintiffs’ cellular and home phones. Brown and Jenkins are seeking damages for each alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[31]
BMG Rights Management vs. Cox Communications[edit]
On behalf of BMG Rights Management, Rightscorp won a ruling in a jury trial against Cox on December 17, 2015 for $25 million. US District Judge Liam O'Grady, found that Cox failed to "reasonably implement" a method to terminate repeated infringers and that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's "safe harbor" provision did not apply.[32][33][34][35]
In addition, Lloyd's of London took legal action to remove their liability obligations to Cox, based on, according their filings, negligence and disregard for copyright infringement violations.[36] The total amount Cox could be liable for, with Lloyd's underwriting, is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.[37]
Finances[edit]
In October 2013 the company went public, trading on the OTCQB under the ticker RIHT.[8] In May 2014 the company announced that it is expanding into Canada[38] and was in Europe investigating expansion in Europe.[39] On November 14, 2014 Rightscorp filed a Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting its Q3 2014 earnings.[40] The company reported a total loss of $2.2 million for the first three quarters of 2014 along with a total loss of $6.5 million since 2011.[40]
In 2015, Rightscorp had a net loss of $3.5 million and in the first three months of 2016 it had a net loss of $784,000.[41]
Security Breach[edit]
Security issues with Rightscorp's online payment system surfaced in October 2014.[42] Due to security gaps with hidden form elements, a Secure Sockets Layer Certificate, and Rightscorp permitting search engine indexing of secure pages; names and address of alleged infringers were publicly exposed including individuals that settled cases with Warner Bros and Miramax Films.[42]
Criticism[edit]
Issues have been raised with regard to Rightscorp's practices. Several court cases have ruled that Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas do not require internet service providers (ISPs) to identify their users to the issuer of the subpoena; indeed, an ISP that does provide that information can face sanctions, as can the issuer of the subpoena.[43] The notice sent by Rightscorp prevents a lawsuit for the specific download in the notice; however, because of the language in the notice, paying the settlement is an admission of guilt. Although Rightscorp is then unable to sue for that infringement, not only can they sue and press charges for subsequent downloads, but they have the original settlement as admission of guilt of previous infringement.
Comcast, the largest internet provider in the United States,[44] has continually refused to forward Rightscorp's DMCA settlement notices in the form in which Rightscorp sends them.[12] Comcast removes the threatening language and the settlement offer and instead simply forwards a letter to their customer that basically reads as an incident report.[45]

The law prevented a monopoly on the part of the booksellers and created a "public domain" for literature after the expiration of the copyright and ensured that once a work was purchased the copyright owner no longer had complete control over its use. For the first time, the law provided for an author's copyright.

				Then in 1787, the framers of the United States Constitution wrote in Article I, Section 8, "the Congress shall have power . . . to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries."


				A major revision of the U.S. Copyright Act was completed in 1909, among other things to address the needs of the brand new recording industry. "The bill broadened the scope of categories protected to include all works of authorship, and extended the term of protection to twenty-eight years with a possible renewal of twenty-eight. The main object to be desired in expanding copyright protection accorded to music has been to give the composer an adequate return for the value of his composition, and it has been a serious and difficult task to combine the protection of the composer with the protection of the public, and to so frame an act that it would accomplish the double purpose of securing to the composer an adequate return for all use made of his composition and at the same time prevent the formation of oppressive monopolies, which might be founded upon the very rights granted to the composer for the purpose of protecting his interests" (H.R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 7 [1909]).




			The History of Digital Piracy


The personal computer debuted on the cover of Popular Electronics in January 1975 and a year later Bill Gates of Microsoft was battling piracy as he was trying to get his fledgling company Microsoft off the ground. In his letter to software pirates of that era, he wrote "Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?"




			The Arrival of P2P


				Shawn  Fanning, while a student at Northeastern University in Boston, changed  the  music and media industry with his creation of a digital  file‐sharing program called  Napster. In 1999, he created a software program that allowed computer users to  share and  exchange files.  Napster had several hundred thousand users by the  spring of 2000, and had grown to over 50 million users by February 2001.  This technology is called Peer-to-peer or P2P because it allows "peers", ordinary computers to exchange files between themselves.

				By 2008, P2P traffic had become 44% of all consumer internet traffic globally and according to “P2P Traffic to Grow Almost 400% over the Next 5 Years, as Legitimate P2P Applications Become a Meaningful Segment” from MultiMedia Intelligence, P2P traffic would grow by 400% by 2013.

				By 2010, according to “Verizon Gets Ahead of the Broadband Crunch” in The Wall Street Journal, file sharing accounted for approximately 35% of all global internet traffic, more than twice as much as web browsing and is forecast to nearly double from 2010 to 2013 to almost 10 Petabytes a month.



The chart above was generated from data by Cisco in its “Global IP Traffic Forecast and Methodology, 2006-2011” and featured at www.satmagazine.com.




			The Digital Millennium Copyright Act



				In the United States, the law is strongly in favor of protecting the interests of copyright holders. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), passed in 1997, heightened the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet and established the liability of the providers of on-line services for copyright infringement by their users. The DMCA made illegal the manufacture, sale, or distribution of code-cracking devices used to illegally copy software, e.g. Limewire, eDonkey and BitTorrent. Additionally, the DMCA states that service providers may not allow the illegal downloading of copyrighted materials via their systems.

				The United States Code 17 U.S.C. 504. states as follows:

				"Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits (2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000."

				The music industry has spent millions of dollars searching for a technology breakthrough to protect copyrighted works. These technologies were often referred to as Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM technologies attempt to prevent digital music player technology from allowing reproduction. These efforts failed to stem the tide of illegal downloading.


					Beginning in 2002, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade group that represents the U.S Music Industry, filed the first lawsuits against individuals who were suspected of illegally downloading music.

					In 2006, Free Peers Inc. closed its business due to a $30 million settlement with the recording industry.  Under the DMCA, the industry has won lawsuits against Napster, Grokster, Bearshare, Limewire and many others. 

					By October 2008, RIAA had filed 30,000 lawsuits against individual downloaders.


				Even with 30,000 lawsuits filed and millions of dollars collected, P2P traffic had still grown worldwide to represent more than 40% of all consumer internet traffic.

ISPs Have Liability If They Do Not Act

				If ISPs are required to make a reasonable effort to curtail illegal activity on their networks. ISPs are given “Safe Harbor” protection as long as once the ISP is notified of a copyright infringement, they forward the notice to their customer.

				Additionally, the DMCA requires ISPs to suspend the service of "repeat infringers."




			How P2P Is Misused



				A February 2010 study done by Sauhard Sahi at Princeton University found that only 1% of files transferred on Bittorrent did not infringe on copyrighted material.

				P2P is Profitable for Pirates

In 2008, it was revealed that just one BitTorrent hosting/tracker site was making $4 million a year on advertising.

Additionally, these sites are making money scraping user’s data from their hard drives and selling it for marketing and even identity theft purposes.

				In February 2010, The Federal Trade Commission sent letters to almost 100 organizations notifying them that personal information, including sensitive data about customers and employees, had been shared from their computer networks and was available on peer -to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks to any users of those networks, who could use it to commit identity theft or fraud.

				How File Sharing Works

				First, a user downloads Frostwire software or any number of other free Gnutella Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications, installs the application on their computer, and searches for a song, movie or game. The Gnutella application then sends a request to the Gnutella network, a voluntary network of all users of Gnutella applications.

				The application uses the network to create a list of all of the available versions of the requested content, which is then displayed. The user selects the version and source of the content that they want to download. The Gnutella application then sends a request for the content out to the network. Usually, the previous users who have downloaded the content have the content available on their computer for the next person who wants it.  After downloading, they would specifically have to disable the application from offering it back to the network. The Gnutella clients literally “talk amongst themselves” without any involvement from the user and the full piece of content gets sent to the requested user in many small pieces from many individual user's computers. Very quickly, the user has the desired content in moments.  An entire discography can take as little as five minute to download on ordinary connections, for free.

				By contrast, the BitTorrent P2P network works in a different way.  First, the user locates a “torrent” file that contains the detailed location of the computers that have the source files. Think of almost any popular old or new recording artists or movie and enter the name into Google. Google will often display a drop down list that will contain the word “discography.” Within the first page of search results you will see the links to the torrent site for the artist or movie. These torrent pages also create revenue from serving advertisements.

				Public torrent hosting sites such as The Pirate Bay allow users to search and download from their collection of torrent files. Users can typically also upload torrent files for content they wish to distribute. Often, these sites also run BitTorrent trackers for their hosted torrent files, but these two functions are not mutually dependent: a torrent file could be hosted on one site and tracked by another, unrelated site.

				The industry has developed its own terminology. Seeders are people who have finished downloading 100% of a file and are sharing it for download. Leachers are people who are downloading the file and sharing a small part of it at the same time.

				In order to obtain and maintain rapid downloads; a user usually must allow their computer to upload desired content back to the network.

				BitTorrent Private host/tracker sites such as Demonoid operate like public ones except that they restrict access to registered users and keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads, in an attempt to reduce leeching.

				BitTorrent search engines allow the discovery of torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites; examples include Mininova, BTJunkie, Torrentz, The Pirate Bay, Eztorrent and isoHunt. These sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria (such as containing a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of links to torrent files matching those criteria.

	Why Did I Receive a Notice?

	It is a violation of United States Federal Law 17 USC 106 to "share" our clients media on peer-to-peer "filesharing" programs like BitTorrent, uTorrent, Vuze and Frostwire or similar applications.  These programs copy and distribute the files that they "share."  A copyright means that the copyright owner has the sole right to determine who may copy and distribute the copyrighted works.

	If you receieved a notice, then a computer located at the internet address that the notice is addressed to, has uploaded, downloaded or offered to distribute the copyrighted content detailed in the notice which clearly identifies the name and type of material, the time the offence occurrred, the IP Address and Port of the originating location.

	The computer at issue is not authorized to distribute this content.  Accordingly, any distribution is a violation of law.  The content is owned by our customer and the customer has authorized us to monitor illegal sharing/distribution of this content.

	It is the subscriber’s responsibility to assure that his or her connection is being used lawfully. Specifically, to make sure that any wireless routers have passwords to prevent unauthorized access and that houseguests and family members are using the connection lawfully.

	Overview

	Rightscorp's software monitors the global Peer‐to‐ Peer (P2P) file sharing networks to seek out and find illegally downloaded digital media. On behalf of digital media copyright owners, and through major Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”), we automatically send out copyright infringement and demand notices to those who have illegally downloaded digital media.

	Infringers remit payment to Rightscorp, Inc. for the copyright infringement and Rightscorp makes payment to the copyright owners. Many infringers who do not pay are disconnected by their ISPs.

	The problem is huge, there were 40 billion illegal downloads of music in 2008 and 12 billion illegal downloads of movies in 2009 alone. Rightscorp's technology system monitors the global Peer‐to‐Peer (P2P) file sharing networks and sends emails to ISPs using the notice format specified in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with the date, time, song title and other specific technology identifiers to confirm the infringement by the ISP’s customer.

	Under Federal Copyright Law, once the ISP has actual knowledge of copyright infringements that take place using its network, it has specific duties in relation to the enforcement of the rights of the owners of the material in question. Every ISP is required by law to enforce a policy that provides, in appropriate circumstances, for termination of internet service to subscribers who become repeat infringers. 

	Your ISP’s terms of use (or similar user agreement) probably specifically state that it can terminate your service if you violate the copyrights of others.  One way that an ISP can satisfy its own legal obligations is to facilitate its subscribers’ compliance with copyright law – including by terminating subscribers who repeatedly violate copyright laws.  When the ISP notifies its subscriber of an infringement (by passing along Rightscorp's notice or otherwise), the customer remits payment to Rightscorp who passes on a percentage to the copyright owner.

	Digital Copyrights & Piracy Background

Is Filesharing Illegal? 


				U.S copyright law, including the changes embodied in The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA,”) calls for substantial penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.  Under established statutory and case law, third parties that assist or are other wise involved in copyright infringement can have vast legal exposure as well.  In the P2P context, an individual subscriber may be the “direct “ infringer of a copyright, but that subscriber’s activities are conducted over the ISP’s facilities.  Accordingly, ISPs that become aware of illegal file-sharing over their networks, but that fail to take steps to mitigate it are at risk of liabilities large enough to put them out of business.  That is why ISPs are serious about illegal P2P activity.  They have to be.

				The United States Code 17 U.S.C. 504. states as follows:

				Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits (2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed wilfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than $150,000.

				Obviously, ISPs want to avoid this type of liability.  The DMCA gives ISPs a road map (often referred to as the “safe harbors”) that tells them what they must do to avoid being liable themselves for copyright infringement that is carried on by their subscribers.  ISPs can take advantage of “safe harbour” benefits by helping Rightscorp contact individual subscribers and settle infringement issues with them. 




The P2P Landscape


				The most popular access tools are Limewire, BitTorrent and eMule and the most popular corresponding protocols being Gnutella, BitTorrent and eDonkey.

				There are operating companies like Lime Group LLC that sell and market the Limewire access software and BitTorrent, Inc. that market and sell the BitTorrent software. Limewire was sued by the music industry and by Universal Music Group specifically.

				A user downloads Limewire software or any number of other free Gnutella clients, installs it on their computer, and searches for a song. The Gnutella client sends a query to the Gnutella network and a list of all of the available versions of the song comes up. The user selects the version that they want. The Gnutella client sends a request for the song out to the network. The previous users who have downloaded the song have the song available on their computer for the next person who wants it. The Gnutella clients literally “talk amongst themselves” without any involvement from the user and the full song gets sent to the requested user in thousands of small pieces from thousands of individual computers. This is what makes it so fast.

				The BitTorrent network works slightly differently. It requires that the user first locate a “torrent” file that contains the detail on the location of the computers that have the source files.

				The industry has developed its own terminology. Seeders are people who have finished downloading 100% of a file and are sharing it for download. Leachers are people who are downloading the file and sharing a small part of it at the same time.

				It is very important to grasp that in order to obtain rapid downloads; a user must allow their computer to upload to the network.




If It Is Illegal, Why Does It Continue? 


				Under FCC regulations, ISPs are not allowed to block specific types of network traffic. The idea being that if they are allowed to block peer-to-peer traffic, they could also block any type of content, religious or political, a violation of freedom of speech.

				ISP’s do have the obligation to assist copyright holders in their enforcement of their rights, but the ISPs cannot fullfill that obligation by simply blocking access to P2P traffic. 




How it Works 


				Our technology system monitors the global Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing networks and sends emails to Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) as per the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with the date, time, song title and other specific technology identifiers to confirm the infringement by the ISP’s customer.  

				Once the ISP is in possession of these facts, they forward the notice, or send a distinct notice, to their customer and to disconnect the services of repeat offenders when appropriate. Rightscorp, Inc. collects payments and makes remits to the copyright owner a percentage of these settlements. 

				Every mp3 file that is downloaded has at least two copyrights, a sound recording copyright and a publishing copyright. The publishing copyright is the right to use the song separate from the sound recording such as putting the song in a movie, re-recording the song or printing the lyrics and melody on sheet music. According to US law, copyright owners have the right to be paid when their copyrighted materials are used. We have an agreement with the recording artist, music label or music publisher who owns the copyright cited in the notice you received.

				Our technology monitors the Internet all of the time looking for infringements. When a copyright is infringed upon, we receive the following data


					Date and Time of infringement

					Filename

					ISP Name

					IP Address

					Port (similar to the last four digits on your nine-digit zip code)


				We send this data to the ISP in an automated computer format called XML. These emails are called “DMCA notices,” and they follow the format prescribed in subsection 512( c) of the DMCA.  Though the format is the same (for other legal reasons), these notices should not be confused with “Takedown” notices. The ISP keeps “router logs” of all of the activity on their networks. When we send these notices, they cross-reference the data we send with their router logs. By doing this cross reference, the ISP knows which one of their customers was using the IP Address in question at the time and date specified. Due to the DMCA law as described above, they forward these notices to their customer on the customer’s email address. The notice comes to the customer from their ISP, not from Rightscorp, Inc.

				The user who receives the notice, is liable for $150,000 in damages, but if they click on the link supplied by Rightscorp, they can enter a credit card and we will settle the matter between them and the copyright owner quickly and affordably.

SANTA MONICA, Calif., June 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Rightscorp (OTCQB: RIHT), a leading provider of data analytics and litigation services, as well as copyright infringement protection services to support artists and owners of copyrighted property, is pleased to highlight a recent feature on DSLReports, a digital site covering the latest on ISP reviews, news & tech information.








The piece titled, "New ISP Anti-Piracy Plan Could Involve Hijacking Your Browser" cites Rightscorp's increase in progress in discussions with top ISPs on implementing a system to address holding their users accountable for alleged infringers of copyrighted content. A major catalyst for this was driven by the ruling of a February 2017 case with BMG and Cox Communications, in which Cox was fined up to $25 million for damages and $8 million in legal fees resulting from piracy and third-party infringements.

About Rightscorp, Inc.
Rightscorp (RIHT) is a leading provider of data and analytic services to support artists and owners of copyrighted Intellectual Property (IP). The Company's patent pending digital loss prevention technology focuses on the infringement of rights to digital content such as music, movies, software, books and games and ensures that the rights of owners and creators are protected. Rightscorp works closely with its clients to develop programs of education and notice, and as necessary to pursue copyright infringers for their illegal file sharing activities via notifications sent through Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company's technology identifies copyright infringers, who are provided information about copyrights and the importance of Intellectual Property and offered a reasonable opportunity to terminate their activities and pay a nominal settlement option that is generally a fraction of the statutory minimum in an effort to avoid the need for expensive litigation. With minimum statutory penalties of $750 and up to $150,000 per infringement, Rightscorp's technology and process of notice allows all parties to efficiently and economically address copyright infringement without the costs and burdens of litigation. Based on the fact that 22% of all Internet traffic is used to distribute copyrighted content without permission or compensation to the creators, Rightscorp's technology and process provides one of the best and most cost efficient means of addressing this issue for both the artists and those who have infringed their works.

Is It Time for the Internet to Grow Up?
— by  Robert Steele, CTO, Rightscorp
The status quo on the Internet is that songwriters, authors, filmmakers and application developers find their work distributed on multiple platforms, without their permission and in violation of our laws. Web 4.0 should do more to empower a content creator’s right to choose to have his or her content distributed.
It seems like every day we hear about all of the amazing things that the Internet will do for us. We are told to look forward to “The Internet of Things” and the “Semantic Web.” A future where “technology and human become one” is coming quickly, according to Nils Muller, CEO of TrendOne, a German micro trend analysis firm.

Popcorn Time Recovers From Outage
Popcorn Time, the Netflix-style piracy application for movies and television started having performance problems in June.  The screen that usually displays the movie posters to enable the streaming of movies started displaying “Error loading data, try again later . . .” message.  The fact that the TV functionality was working but the movie page was not led us to suspect that this may have been a result of some sort of outside intervention.

As Predicted, Cox's Latest Appeal Points To SCOTUS' Refusal To Disconnect Sex Offenders From Social Mediafrom the which-is-worse? dept

Last week the Supreme Court managed to hold its nose long enough to properly assert that banning convicted sex offenders from social media was plainly an infringement on their First Amendment rights. While much of the media coverage focused on the question of sex offenders having access to these well-trafficked websites, the real implications of the ruling were always likely to be far more reaching. We specifically pointed to the reasonable question: if sex offenders can't be blocked from internet sites due to their First Amendment rights, how can we possibly require ISPs to disconnect those accused of piracy from the internet under even the most tortured reading of 512(i) of the DMCA? In that original post, Mike wrote:



I expect that to be quoted in many other cases -- and a big one may be the ongoing attempts right now by the legacy entertainment industry to force ISPs to kick people off of their service based on accusations (not convictions) of infringement. Those cases, like this Packingham case, involve using a law to claim that people should be blocked from using the internet. And based on the quotes above, it seems quite likely that parts of the DMCA are clearly unconstitutional. The lawsuits -- mainly the BMG v. Cox ruling which is currently on appeal, and the more recent UMG v. Grande Communications (which follows the same basic outlines of the Cox case) -- involve arguing that 512(i) of the DMCA requires ISPs to kick users off their service entirely based on accusations of infringement. As we've explained, this already appears to be a twisted interpretation of 512(i), but now it appears there's a very reasonable chance that the Supreme Court could find 512(i) outright unconstitutional under the First Amendment for broadly blocking internet access in a way that harms free speech rights.



It appears we're starting down the road of finding out exactly what the court's answer to this question will be, as Cox recently filed an appeal and has now referenced the SCOTUS decision in its written arguments.



Packingham is directly relevant to what constitute ‘appropriate circumstances’ to terminate Internet access to Cox’s customers. The decision emphatically establishes the centrality of Internet access to protected First Amendment activity.


As the Court recognized, Internet sources are often ‘the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge’.



The filing goes on to note that the government is not allowed to infringe on free speech in order to prohibit unlawful speech. If ever there were an example of that very thing, it certainly would be accused pirates being disconnected from what has now been cited as a speech medium in the internet. I'm genuinely looking forward to hearing oral arguments from the legal staff of the movie and record labels that those accused of piracy, typically on flimsy at best evidence, ought to be afforded less rights than convicted sex offenders. We've seen much demonizing of the internet in general and piracy in particular, but I'm having a hard time conjuring up the images of those lawyers managing to go that far. That's an argument that's going to need to be made, however, given the contention of Cox's latest filing.



And if it offends the Constitution to cut off a portion of Internet access to convicted criminals, then the district court’s erroneous interpretation of Section 512(i) of the DMCA — which effectively invokes the state’s coercive power to require ISPs to terminate all Internet access to merely accused infringers — cannot stand.



A win for Cox would mean much for the free speech rights of everyone in regards to internet access. A loss would mean this country's court system has some seriously skewed priorities for who should and should not be allowed access to the web.

How The Supreme Court's Recent Free Speech Ruling May Destroy Hollywood's Plans To Kick People Off The Internetfrom the about-that... dept

Earlier this week, we wrote about the details of the Supreme Court's ruling in Packingham v. North Carolina -- the case that said a North Carolina law that barred convicted sex offenders from using social media was unconstitutional. There were some good lines in the ruling, but this may be the most important:



Even with these assumptions about the scope of the law and the State’s interest, the statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of First Amendment speech it burdens. Social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another about it on any subject that might come to mind.... By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge. These websites can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard. They allow a person with anInternet connection to “become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox."...


In sum, to foreclose access to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights. It is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have completed their sentences. Even convicted criminals—and in some instances especially convicted criminals—might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, in particular if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.



As we noted in our original post, I expect that to be quoted in many other cases -- and a big one may be the ongoing attempts right now by the legacy entertainment industry to force ISPs to kick people off of their service based on accusations (not convictions) of infringement. Those cases, like this Packingham case, involve using a law to claim that people should be blocked from using the internet. And based on the quotes above, it seems quite likely that parts of the DMCA are clearly unconstitutional. The lawsuits -- mainly the BMG v. Cox ruling which is currently on appeal, and the more recent UMG v. Grande Communications (which follows the same basic outlines of the Cox case) -- involve arguing that 512(i) of the DMCA requires ISPs to kick users off their service entirely based on accusations of infringement. As we've explained, this already appears to be a twisted interpretation of 512(i), but now it appears there's a very reasonable chance that the Supreme Court could find 512(i) outright unconstitutional under the First Amendment for broadly blocking internet access in a way that harms free speech rights.


As noted by copyright professor Annemarie Bridy, this clearly could impact those other cases following this ruling:



Packingham is relevant to this conversation because it stands quite clearly for the proposition that broadly defined state-mandated limits on access to the Internet raise serious First Amendment issues. Packingham challenged the constitutionality of a North Carolina criminal statute prohibiting registered sex offenders from accessing “commercial social networking sites” on the Internet. In striking down the statute on First Amendment grounds, the Court emphasized the critical importance of the Internet in general, and social media platforms in particular, to everyday life in the “Cyber Age.” While the Court recognized a significant governmental interest in preventing use of the Internet for criminal activity, it held that North Carolina’s ban on social media access swept too broadly. Interestingly, the Court elected not to decide with precision how much of the Internet the challenged statute put off limits. It declined to say—because it didn’t think it had to—whether the statute’s prohibition reached sites like Amazon.com, Washingtonpost.com, and WebMD.com in addition to “commonly understood” social networking sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. The Court concluded that the statute couldn’t survive First Amendment scrutiny even if it were narrowly construed to cover only the social media platforms that everyone can agree are social media platforms. To put it another way, the statute’s prohibition was broad enough to offend the First Amendment even when narrowly construed to cover only parts of the Web.



Bridy doesn't go so far as to argue that Packingham means 512(i) is unconstitutional -- in fact, she notes that it's more limited than the North Carolina law that was struck down. But, she notes:



Packingham’s holding should serve as a reminder to lower courts interpreting section 512(i) that termination of access to the Internet implicates core First Amendment values: “While in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in the spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear. It is cyberspace.” Consequently, courts should consider it reasonable, and within the bounds of the DMCA safe harbor, for broadband providers to determine that “appropriate circumstances” for terminating a user’s access to the whole Internet for infringing copyright are very rare.



Harold Feld, from Public Knowledge, goes a bit further in his own analysis, arguing that when it comes to internet access providers, it seems clear that parts of 512(i) requiring termination, should be seen as unconstitutional, while also pointing out that to argue against this might mean Hollywood arguing that copyright infringement is somehow worse that child molestation.



Granted, Hollywood lobbyists and their wholly owned subsidiaries in Congress are capable of arguing with a straight face that copyright infringement is actually worse than child molestation and therefore the government purpose is sufficiently compelling to override all First Amendment concerns. And some judges, like the district court judge in the BMG v. Cox decision, would probably agree. (Read his opinion here to see if you agree.) But I’m doubtful that the majority of appeals court judges will agree. Whether or not one treats the majority opinion’s public forum analysis of social networks as “dicta” (which is legalese for “stuff in an opinion I don’t like so I don’t consider binding”), all 8 Supreme Court justices agreed that subscribers have a First Amendment right to access information and speak online, and that the government cannot prohibit a person from accessing content that has nothing to do with preventing repeat offenses — even when the repeat offense is child molestation, and the evidence arguably supported that child molesters were particularly prone to repetition.


Sorry, if molesting minors doesn’t justify permanently kicking you off the Internet, downloading 3 advance copies of Transformers: The Last Knight shouldn’t either. Congress cannot require ISPs to terminate subscribers accused of downloading pirating material (which is what Section 512(i) amounts to) anymore than it can criminalize accessing the Internet after being accused of downloading pirated material. Nor do I expect Big Content to prevail by arguing that getting you thrown off your ISP isn’t blocking you from accessing the Internet, because of all the amazing broadband options you have to replace your loss of service. While America boasted thousands of dial-up ISPs in 1998 when the DMCA was passed, most folks are lucky to have a choice of two landline providers capable of providing reliable, always on broadband of sufficient quality to allow me to engage in all my protected First Amendment online activity.



There is the separate question of whether or not this ruling would also kill off 512(i) as it applies to service providers on the network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Techdirt, etc...) rather than internet access providers, such as Comcast, AT&T, etc. Feld thinks there is an argument that the opinion could be read to block such rulings as well:



Whether Packingham makes Section 512(i)’s requirement that all social media sites and other “covered entities” have termination policies for “repeat infringers” is somewhat less clear. Taking the majority analysis as actual opinion rather than “undisciplined dicta,” then the answer is clearly yes for major social network sites and platforms including — wait for it — Youtube. It’s kind of hard to argue that the largest online video platform, whose videos include some of the most important raw footage of critical events and which has become a central location for debate, doesn’t qualify as the kind of online public forum Kennedy described. Nor does it make much sense to say access to Facebook and Twitter are protected under the First Amendment while access to Youtube isn’t.


OTOH, I’m not sure the same analysis applies to cloud storage or other services that don’t share the attributes of a general public forum. And, of course, websites or services that are set up expressly to facilitate the exchange of infringing material don’t qualify for safe harbor protection anyway, so the hypothetical Doctor Evil Sing Along Piracy Exchange is already subject to liability.



Of course, none of this should apply to the platforms making decisions themselves over removing content or users from their own platforms (for which the platforms have their own First Amendment protections). Yet, I would not be at all surprised to see someone raise this issue in court, and argue that Packingham means that major social networks (Facebook, especially, but likely Twitter and YouTube as well) have no right to bar users. I think that would be a bad result, but the language in the Packingham ruling at least makes such a ruling a lot more plausible than it was last week.


The Packingham ruling is likely to have quite a lot of impact, and as predicted yesterday, I expect it to be quoted frequently in cases involving the internet over the next few years.

Copyright Troll Rightscorp Ramps Up Its Efforts To Get ISPs To Push Its Payment Demands On Usersfrom the intended-consequences dept

Remember Rightscorp? This is the wannabe "friendlier" copyright troll, that sends smaller bills than the traditional copyright trolls. Over the years, it's actually struggled to make any money... and has struggled with some of its more bizarre legal theories. Unfortunately, in late 2015, one of Rightscorp's partners got a big ruling against Cox, arguing that Cox violated the DMCA by not properly terminating repeat infringers (as we noted at the time, this was based on a tortured interpretation of the law). The case is still winding its way through the appeals process, but Rightscorp and its partners have continued to push forward, using the ruling in that BMG v. Cox case to pressure others. At least one other ISP has already been sued.


And, now, the company is out claiming that it's talking with "top ISPs" to get them to incorporate Rightscorp's copyright trolling efforts directly into their own infringement mitigation procedures:



“An ISP Good Corporate Citizenship Program is what we feel will drive revenue associated with our primary revenue model. This program is an attempt to garner the attention and ultimately inspire a behavior shift in any ISP that elects to embrace our suggestions to be DMCA-compliant,” the company told shareholders yesterday.


“In this program, we ask for the ISPs to forward our notices referencing the infringement and the settlement offer. We ask that ISPs take action against repeat infringers through suspensions or a redirect screen. A redirect screen will guide the infringer to our payment screen while limiting all but essential internet access.”



In other words, Rightscorp's demand and payment processes would get included directly into how the ISP notifies a user that someone has discovered the possibility of infringing activity on the account. Of course, issuing a press release saying that they're "now beginning to have some initial and very thorough discussions with a handful of the top ISPs" is... weird. You do your press releases after you come to a deal, not as you're beginning a conversation with companies who almost certainly don't want to work with you. The reality here is likely that this press release is just an attempt to signal to ISPs to be more receptive. I highly doubt it will work on most large ISPs who are slightly more sophisticated than to be duped by something as silly as this.


However, the threat of the BMG case being seen as good law is still a huge problem for those ISPs and hopefully the case will get dumped, and we can all go back to watching Rightscorp fail to make any money from its plans. Remember, in the BMG case, it came out that Rightscorp had a phone script that told people it accused of infringing that if they wanted to prove they were "innocent" they had to hand their computers over to the local police department so they could perform a search. Really. Does anyone think that a company with that sort of ethical compass should be the official partner of any ISP?


On top of that, as TorrentFreak points out in its article, for all the talk of how Rightscorp is a "friendlier" copyright troll in that it only demands $20 to $30 when it finds an infringement, that's misleading. Because, like responding to spam leading to more spam, paying Rightscorp can lead to many more demands:



In the wake of several similar reports, this week a Reddit user reported that Rightscorp asked him to pay a single $20 fine for pirating a song. After paying up, the next day the company allegedly called the user back and demanded payment for a further 200 notices.

Dangerous: Judge Says It Was 'Objectively Unreasonable' For Cox To Claim DMCA Safe Harborsfrom the this-is-bad dept

We've been covering the BMG v. Cox case since the beginning, and a bad decision just got made even worse -- and more dangerous. If you've been following the case, you know that it's on appeal right now (and a whole bunch of amici have weighed in), but in the meantime, the judge in the district court, Judge Liam O'Grady, has doubled down on his opportunity to chop up and mock the DMCA's safe harbors by telling Cox it must pay $8 million to BMG in legal fees because its using the DMCA safe harbors as a defense was found to be "objectively unreasonable."


That's crazy, for a variety of reasons, but we'll get there. From the very beginning, this case was a joke, and it's unfortunate that the court didn't realize that early on. The case was filed back in 2014, and we pointed out that it was really BMG (and another publisher, Round Hill Music) acting as a proxy for copyright trolling operation Rightscorp, testing out the wacky legal theory that the DMCA requires that ISPs kick repeat infringers entirely off the internet. No one has ever interpreted the DMCA in this manner. Yes, 512(i) requires a repeat infringer policy, but it had always been widely recognized that that referred to services that hosted content, not network providers (e.g., YouTube is required to have a repeat infringer policy that kicks users off YouTube if they keep posting infringing works, but your ISP shouldn't kick you off the internet for the same thing.)


If that interpretation of the law was legit, you'd think that someone would have tried it in court before -- especially with all the whining from the MPAA and RIAA about how ISPs weren't doing enough to stop piracy. So this was a real stretch as a legal theory.


But, somewhat amazingly -- even after the legal proceedings demonstrated that the lawsuit was really about copyright trolling and exposed some heinously bad behavior by copyright troll Rightscorp -- the case went against Cox and in favor of BMG (Round Hill Music was kicked out of the case early on).


O'Grady made it pretty clear in the case that he's not a big fan of this internet thing, and doesn't see why it's a big deal if someone were to get kicked off the internet. At one point in the proceedings, Public Knowledge and EFF sought to file an amicus brief. Admittedly, many district court judges aren't fans of amicus briefs (they're more usually seen at appellate courts), but O'Grady was so dismissive of this one that it was fairly incredible:



I read the brief. It adds absolutely nothing helpful at all. It is a combination of describing the horrors that one endures from losing the Internet for any length of time. Frankly, it sounded like my son complaining when I took his electronics away when he watched YouTube videos instead of doing homework. And it's completely hysterical.



So, yeah. Judge O'Grady then said that Cox wasn't protected by the DMCA at all, which made it easy for the jury to find in favor of BMG and award it $25 million from Cox. Part of the problem was that there was some sketchy behavior by Cox (including some really dumb emails by staff who don't understand the law, but look damning), but none of it should have directly impacted the legal issues, but that behavior clearly influenced O'Grady.


And, now, because of that, O'Grady has awarded legal fees, by arguing that Cox relying on the very same DMCA safe harbors that everyone else relies on and where Cox was the only major ISP that would kick off any user for infringement, was somehow "objectively unreasonable." Think about that for a second. Let's repeat it: Cox's policy was the only one at a major ISP that kicked people off the network for repeat infringement. And every network provider regularly relies on the DMCA safe harbor to protect them from liability. And yet, Judge Liam O'Grady's opinion says that it was "objectively unreasonable." Oddly, O'Grady's opinion here is again entirely focused on the bad behavior by some Cox employees, and not the overall question of whether or not the safe harbor actually works the way O'Grady (and Rightscorp and basically no one else) seems to think it works. Rather than explaining why it's "objectively unreasonable" for Cox to rely on the DMCA's safe harbors, O'Grady basically says that the reliance was unreasonable... because of the bad behavior. That's conflating two separate things. Sanction them for bad behavior if you must, but don't let that cloud the actual legal issue.



The objective reasonableness of a party's position is an important factor in deciding
whether to award fees.... In a hard-fought litigation battle such
as this one, discovery disputes and fierce briefing are to be expected, and they should not be held
too harshly against either party. Nonetheless, there are a few instances in which Cox's advocacy
crossed the line of objective reasonableness. In particular, both Cox's attempts to obscure its
practice of reinstating infringing customers, and its subsequent assertions of a deeply flawed
DMCA defense evince a meritless litigation position that Cox vigorously defended.


[....]


.... Although Cox's DMCA defense cannot be
categorized as frivolous or in bad faith, the Court found that "[t]he record conclusively
establishes that before the fall of 2012, Cox did not implement its repeat infringer policy.
Instead, Cox publicly purported to comply with its policy, while privately disparaging and
intentionally circumventing the requirements."... The
evidence supporting this conclusion was overwhelming, and it included "smoking gun" email
conversations.... The most memorable of these contained Cox's own abuse manager
stating: "F . . . the dmca!!!"...
Therefore, although Cox's defensive arguments may have been reasonable as an abstract legal
theory, when viewed in light of the actual facts of the case, they evince an objectively
unreasonable litigation position that was nonetheless vigorously defended.



It's clear that O'Grady is hung up on the bad behavior and statements by Cox employees. And, again, what they were saying was really bad. But the real question is whether or not it actually violated the DMCA. And Cox argued, quite reasonably, that it did not. The DMCA doesn't actually require what O'Grady and BMG insist it does, and no other ISP even goes as far as Cox did (bad behavior or not). So because you have some clueless Cox employees, who were spouting off internally about how much they hate the DMCA (an opinion shared by many) and because they implemented their repeat infringer policy in a way that O'Grady felt wasn't reasonable, suddenly arguing that the safe harbors still should apply (because they should!) is "objectively unreasonable"? That's dangerous.


Again, the earlier parts of the case are already on appeal, so hopefully this will all get wiped out and this order won't matter in the long run either. But if it does stand, it's yet another serious problem that's come out of this particular case.

Rightscorp Rings In The New Year By Vowing To Find New Ways To Lose Money In 2017from the penny-stock-that-could! dept

Rightscorp is doing some aggressive whistling in the dark. The company that thought it could tackle piracy with threatening letters, threatening robocalls, and suing ISPs for contributory infringement has been bleeding money since its inception.


By the middle of 2015, Rightscorp's letter-writing campaign to torrenters had led to nothing resembling a viable business model.



According to 10-K documents filed with the SEC earlier this month, the total loss from Rightscorp operations for 2014 was $3,398,873, with revenues of just $930,729 for the year. "As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was approximately $7,093,377," states the filing, adding that the company lacks the revenue to allow it to "continue as a going concern." Rightscorp stock price, meanwhile, similarly isn't much to write home about. Not so viable for a company that on a recent earnings call declared itself "one of the only viable solutions to the multi-billion dollar problem of peer-to-peer piracy."



One year later, Rightscorp itself was finally questioning its own viability.



The company, which monitors and targets repeated copyright infringers with extralegal payment notices, reported an operating loss of $784,180 during the three months ended March 31, a slight improvement from the $930,000 loss a year earlier. Rightscorp only generated revenues of $68,283, a 78 percent drop from 2015 Q1’s $307,904, and its services accrued only $49,142 due to copyright holders -- a third of the $153,952 gathered during the first three months of 2015.



There's another 10-K from the company due in March. Chances are there will be nothing in it to reassure whatever investors the company has left. Its stock price is lower than it's ever been… which isn't really saying much as it's spent the last couple years south of the 25-cent mark.






With more bad news on the near horizon, perhaps that's why it appears to be acting as its own cheerleader ahead of its eventual mandated disclosures. Its December 26 press release contains some questionable assertions, not the least of which is that it's the "content creator's champion."



In the notice of infringement, Rightscorp offers a choice between paying a small settlement fee of $30 facing a possible lawsuit for damages of around $150,000 USD under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the current law.



It's a false choice. Rightscorp and the artists signed to it aren't going to sue individual infringers for $150,000 in statutory damages. (Instead, Rightscorp has intervened in questionable lawsuits against ISPs for contributory infringement.) The RIAA found out long ago that dragging people IP addresses to court generated more antagonism than revenue. There are a few copyright trolls out there milking porn/terrible films with speculative invoices filed in federal court against fistfuls of Does, but none of them have shown this reliably generates revenue, much less deters piracy.


So far, Rightscorp is only chasing down music pirates. That plan of attack has worked so poorly the company can barely keep its doors open. Naturally, it's decided it isn't wasting its limited funds fast enough. (All grammatical/spelling errors in the original.)



A small growing company with modest revenue, Rightscorp has by no means conquered the problem of Internet piracy. But with proven technology, a unique way monetize digital loss prevention, and an astute management team at the helm, investors should take a serious look at Rigthscorp. In 2017, the Company is pursuing an aggressive growth strategy in focused on expanding its reach in the film and television arenas.



"Modest revenue." That's an understatement.


Rightcorp's statement is accurate when it says it hasn't conquered internet piracy. The next sentence, however, is filled with assertions so blatantly wrong, the only way they could possibly be made with a straight face is via this exact form of communication: a self-congratulatory press release.


The only thing "proven" about its "technology" is that it's able to uncover IP addresses. This is where its form of speculative invoicing originates, with letters going to ISPs, which are then asked to forward them to the subscribers at the listed IP addresses. Rightscorp doesn't know who the alleged infringers are, so there's not a lot technical wizardry going on here.


And yes, Rightscorp has found a "unique way [to] monetize" its anti-piracy effort. It all depends on how you choose to define "unique." And "monetizaton." "Hardly at all" seems to be a fairly accurate summation of its "unique monetization." "Doesn't make much money at all, actually" is another tagline that could be applied to it.


As for the "astute management" at the helm? I don't know. Rightscorp has already seen what isn't working and wants to do more of it for more forms of content. That's the definition of "insanity," not astuteness.


I don't think Rightscorp has much left in the tank. Its decision to build its business model on something that has failed for many others was never a good idea, even if it routed its demand letters through ISPs, rather than federal courtrooms. Once you've suckered in the easily-intimidated and the poorly-informed, you're faced with the considerably more-uphill battle of talking file sharers out of $30 per alleged infringement using nothing more than boilerplate and the ethereal threat of statutory damages. It hasn't worked so far for Rightscorp. Adding movies and TV shows to the mix isn't going to fix what's fundamentally wrong with its strategy. It's only going to give Rightscorp new ways to fail.

As Expected Judge Upholds His Own Problematic Ruling Concerning Cox's Repeat Infringer Policy & The DMCAfrom the moving-on-up-to-the-appeals-court dept
For nearly two years now, we've been following an important DMCA-related case between music publisher BMG and the ISP Cox Communications. While the issues are a bit down in the weeds, what it really comes down to is a question of whether or not internet access providers are required to have a "repeat infringer" policy that removes customers who are seen to have been engaged in too much copyright infringement. Most people had assumed that the DMCA's requirements for a repeat infringer policy only applied to hosting providers -- i.e., those who help people host content -- as opposed to transit providers, who are merely providing the connectivity. In this case, though, that important nuance seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle, mainly because of some stupid behavior on the part of Cox. Amazingly, Cox is basically the only major ISP out there that has a history of actually kicking people off its service for infringement. Most others have historically refused to do so. But Cox's policy is ridiculously complex, and involves something around 13 steps... and, on top of that, Cox admitted that once it's kicked people off they can just sign up for new service. Seeing all that, the court basically decided that Cox was acting in bad faith, and thus jumped right over the question of whether or not the repeat infringer policy even applied to Cox.

The judge in the case, Judge Liam O'Grady (who is also handling the Kim Dotcom case...) is not exactly known for his love of the internet. Earlier in the case, he had mocked the idea that there was any harm in kicking people off the internet. Responding to an attempt by Public Knowledge and the EFF to file an amicus brief, the judge mocked both organizations and the proposed brief itself:

It is a combination of describing the horrors that one endures from losing the Internet for any length of time. Frankly, it sounded like my son complaining when I took his electronics away when he watched YouTube videos instead of doing homework. And it's completely hysterical.

Up against that, it's no surprise that Cox found itself on the losing side. We explained why this ruling was so problematic and it goes way beyond the $25 million Cox was told to pay BMG.

As part of the process of moving on to appeal, Cox asked Judge O'Grady to reconsider his original ruling as a matter of law, and he's now rejected that plea with a fairly long and detailed opinion. Cox raised three specific concerns about the original ruling, saying that BMG failed to show actual direct infringement, that it failed to provide evidence of Cox's liability and that it also failed to show evidence of willfulness. O'Grady is not impressed.

On the question of direct infringement, Cox pointed out all of the problems with Rightscorp's system (which is what BMG was using) in identifying infringement -- and also argued that Rightscorp's own downloads aren't evidence of infringement. BMG responded that they tested Rightscorp's system and it seemed accurate to them. O'Grady says that Rightscorp's downloads are perfectly good evidence and doesn't go much deeper than that.

On the question of Cox's liability is where things really go off the rails. Cox points to the famous (and important) ruling in the Sony Betamax case that said that VCR devices are legal thanks to "substantial non-infringing uses." BMG then tried to use the Grokster ruling on inducement to undermine what the Supreme Court said in Sony. Here, O'Grady decides that the Sony ruling was a narrow one. That's a problem. O'Grady says that because Cox has an ongoing relationship with potential infringers, rather than ending that relationship at the point of sale, the Sony standard doesn't apply.

Such a claim is possible here because, unlike in Sony, Cox maintains an ongoing relationship with users of its service. Sony's last point of contact with users of the VTR was at the point of sale.... An ongoing relationship between a defendant and direct infringers presents a potential for culpability quite beyond distribution or design....

The judge also rejects the "in the alternative" argument presented by Cox that even if Sony doesn't apply, under Grokster the only way to apply liability is if Cox was found to have induced infringement (remember, the Supreme Court in the Grokster case made up -- out of thin air -- an "inducement" standard to explain why Grokster's file sharing system wasn't protected by the Sony ruling). Here, however, O'Grady takes the Grokster ruling to mean not just that there's an inducement standard, but rather as open season to come up with reasons why the Sony standard doesn't apply. Yikes.

Cox also argues that if Sony does not provide immunity, the Grokster Court made clear that BMG's only path to liability was through an inducement claim. The Court again disagrees. It bears noting that adopting Cox's reading of Sony and Grokster would greatly simplify this area of law. Sony would be a complete bar to contributory infringement whenever a defendant's product or service is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, and that safe harbor would be removed for only a distinct subset--those that actively induce infringement.

Well... yeah. That's what the courts have said. What's so terrible about that reading of the law? It makes perfect sense. Instead, O'Grady wants the law to be something different -- allowing courts to shut down services with substantial non-infringing uses by pinning liability based on... vague other claims. That's problematic on a number of levels as it almost writes the Sony ruling out of existence. (As an aside, in a footnote, O'Grady notes that if the appeals court disagrees with him on this point, the case is effectively over, as BMG didn't claim that Cox engaged in inducement until after the case was over, which he notes, correctly, "is far too little and far too late."

Finally, on the question of whether or not Cox was "willfully" blind to infringement on its network, O'Grady again takes a very expansive and troubling view of what he believes the law says. While multiple courts have taken the quite reasonable view that "willful" blindness requires actual knowledge of infringing behavior, O'Grady goes with a broader definition, and takes jokey emails from Cox's abuse team as "proof" that it knew of infringement, and then combined that with the fact that Rightscorp bombarded Cox with notices (whose sole purpose was not to stop the infringement, but rather in hopes that Cox would pass them on to subscribers to get those subscribers to cough up money). But Judge O'Grady takes Cox's decision to treat Rightscorp notices more like spam as a sign of willful blindness:

There was a significant amount of evidence of Cox's general knowledge of infringement on its network. Cox received notices from other copyright holders complaining of infringement. Cox knew from its traffic analysis that subscribers were using BitTorrent.... There was evidence from industry reports that the overwhelming majority of traffic on BitTorrent was infringing, and emails among members of the Abuse Group indicated Cox's knowledge of that fact.... ("Bittorrent is used for one thing only... and I would know. ;-)")... ("99% of DMCA violations is from people using P2P on purpose and not Trojan activity.")

While generalized knowledge of infringement occurring on its network is not sufficient standing alone, it did provide the backdrop for Cox's decision to continuously ignore and take no action in response to the 1.8 million notices, weekly letters, and dashboard from Rightscorp. There was also evidence that Cox had configured its graduated response system in such a way as to reduce both the total number of notices that entered the system and the amount of customer-facing action that may be required. Moreover, internal Cox communications, which were admitted over Cox's objections, signaled that Cox's decision not to process Rightscorp's notices may have been due to more than just the presence of the settlement language and instead reflected a general disdain for any enforcement responsibilities.

Again, O'Grady reads this in the worst possible light. But an ISP should have disdain for copyright holders trying to lump all the liability on them. The whole idea that everyone thinks ISPs should be Hollywood's private police force is silly, and it's why the safe harbors of the DMCA are designed to keep most of the liability off of the ISPs.

Not surprisingly, O'Grady also rejects all of Cox's complaints about the jury instructions and the exclusion of certain evidence. This included O'Grady's decision to block evidence of Righscorp's seriously scammy behavior -- such as its phone script telling people who said they hadn't infringed that they needed to hand their computers over to the local police to search the hard drives. O'Grady says he was right to exclude that evidence because it might unfairly prejudice or confuse the jury.

Basically the only thing that goes Cox's way is O'Grady's decision to deny BMG's request for a permanent injunction

At the outset, the Court notes that BMG's brief in support of an injunction relied heavily on a statement of fact that was not true. Specifically, BMG alleged that, following the jury verdict, Cox had continued to ignore Rightscorp's detection of "massive infringement" on its network....

... In fact, Cox provided notice to BMG shortly after trial that Righscorp was no longer blacklisted.

The court goes on to note that BMG's request for an injunction is overly broad and extreme, and would basically allow Rightscorp to kick people off of Cox's service with little oversight. Hilariously, BMG also demands that Cox "hand over the identity, email address, mailing address, and telephone number of every subscriber that BMG identifies...." Which is basically "please let us let Rightscorp play its shakedown game." Thankfully, the court rejects that too and laughs off BMG's claim that this is necessary for "transparency."

Quite obviously, if that were the reason, there would be numerous ways to anonymize subscribers and still track Cox's actions. There certainly would never be a need for an email address, mailing address, and telephone numbers. When asked, counsel conceded that the infromation would be given to Rightscorp...

Anyway, all of this is just prelude anyway. It seems highly likely that Cox will appeal this decision (though, it's also possible that it will come to some sort of settlement agreement with BMG). It's the appeal where all of this will become especially interesting.

$25 Million Jury Verdict In Rightscorp Case Raises Serious Questions About Copyright Lawfrom the but-of-course dept
This wasn't a huge surprise after Judge Liam O'Grady's questionable reading of the DMCA a few weeks back (along with his general disdain for the internet), but a jury yesterday awarded BMG $25 million from Cox Communications, claiming that Cox was guilty of willful "contributory infringement" in not kicking accused file sharers off the internet. The jury found Cox not guilty of "vicarious liability," which is at least marginally surprising, as many people who don't spend their lives wrapped up in copyright law have difficulty distinguishing the difference between "contributory infringement" and "vicarious" (if you're confused too, Wikipedia's overview is a decent place to start). And based on that, the jury hit Cox with the $25 million award for BMG.

This will undoubtedly go to appeal, and it would seem that Cox has some pretty strong arguments. First up, the original decision that Cox is not subject to the DMCA's safe harbors is a highly questionable ruling, and would go against a number of previous rulings. As noted previously, some of Cox's actions did seem somewhat egregious, but this still involves a previously untested argument that the policy of requiring service providers to have a plan to terminate users applies to network service providers, rather than those who host content. That's a pretty big open question -- and how that issue is resolved will have a major impact on how the internet functions going forward. If Judge O'Grady's ruling stands, then the RIAA and MPAA just got a huge golden gift: it would effectively say that the US has a "three strikes"-like law where people can be kicked off the internet entirely, based solely on accusations of copyright infringement. That's a pretty scary result.

Even separate from that, the idea that Cox, an internet service provider, is guilty of "contributory liability" for infringement seems difficult to believe as well. The standard for contributory copyright infringement is basically one who "knowingly induces, causes or materially contributes" to copyright infringement done by someone else where that party "had knowledge, or reason to know, of infringement." So, in this case, the argument is that based on the notifications, Cox had the necessary knowledge of the infringement, and then "materially contributed" to that infringement by continuing to provide service. But, again, that's a huge stretch, and goes way beyond historical examples of contributory infringement, where you had things like Grokster, that actively advertised its software as being useful for infringement. In this case, all Cox did was not terminate users, and somehow that counts as "materially contributing" to infringement?

Again, if that stands, it has tremendously troubling implications for how the internet functions, and the ability of people to use copyright law to wreak havoc on the lives of others. We're talking about opening up the possibility of going way beyond the standard DMCA takedowns of content, to it becoming a weapon for killing internet access within households.

The $25 million verdict comes out to about $18,000 per each of the 1,397 copyrights listed in the case -- which is certainly less than the statutory maximum possibility of $150,000 per infringement. But, still... Either way, it's almost certain that Cox will appeal, and that's when the case will start to get a lot more interesting.

The Details Of Why Judge O'Grady Rejected Cox's DMCA Defense: Bad Decisions By Cox May Lead To Bad Lawfrom the ugh dept
As we noted a couple of weeks ago, Judge Liam O'Grady rejected Cox Communication's attempt to protect itself under the DMCA's safe harbor concerning a "repeat infringer policy." At the time, he only said he would explain his reasons later, and late yesterday he released his full opinion. It, unfortunately, brings to mind the phrase "hard cases make bad law."

As we explained when BMG and Round Hill Music (with the help of Rightscorp) first sued Cox Communications, the company seemed like a slightly odd choice. While it was the largest of the internet access providers not to sign onto the so-called "voluntary" six-strikes "Copyright Alert System" hammered out between the RIAA/MPAA and big ISPs, it already had a reputation for actually disconnecting those accused of repeat infringements. None of the other major ISPs do that. In fact, a key prong of the whole six strikes thing was that no one would be getting kicked off the internet.

However, the RIAA has long insisted that the DMCA's 512(i) required ISPs to kick people off the internet -- even as that theory had never really been tested until now. Many others had assumed 512(i)'s "repeat infringer" policy only really referred to service providers who actually had direct control over content -- i.e., a YouTube or SoundCloud style site. Kicking people entirely off the internet because one person who uses their account to infringe is quite draconian.

The issue here, however, gets muddied, because Cox made such a mess of its "repeat infringer policy." Yes, it alone among the major ISPs will kick people off. But (and this is the important bit), its internal policy was apparently to kick people off... and then allow them to sign right back up for new service, at which point the count on "infringements" would be reset to 0. For obvious reasons, that feels pretty sketchy, and it's the key point that Judge O'Grady focuses on. Doing something that feels sketchy will often obscure the more important legal arguments. Judge O'Grady basically tosses aside all the other issues because of this "bad behavior" by Cox, as immortalized in some internal emails.

The record conclusively establishes that before the fall of 2012 Cox did not implement its
repeat infringer policy. Instead, Cox publicly purported to comply with its policy, while
privately disparaging and intentionally circumventing the DMCA’s requirements. Cox
employees followed an unwritten policy put in place by senior members of Cox’s abuse group by
which accounts used to repeatedly infringe copyrights would be nominally terminated, only to be
reactivated upon request. Once these accounts were reactivated, customers were given clean
slates, meaning the next notice of infringement Cox received linked to those accounts would be
considered the first in Cox’s graduate response procedure.

Numerous emails in the record, portions of which are reproduced below, support these
conclusions. Even viewed in the light most favorable to Cox, the Court finds the contents of the
emails cannot be explained away. Cox’s attempts to recast the emails are unavailing. Nor can
they be pinned on low level employees whose views had no real significance. The name that
appears again and again on these emails is Jason Zabek, Cox’s Manager of Customer Abuse
Operations.

In 2009, Zabek sent an email titled, “DMCA Terminations,” to the abuse group that said:

As we move forward in this challenging time we want to hold on to every
subscriber we can. With this in mind if a customer is terminated for DMCA, you
are able to reactivate them after you give them a stern warning about violating our
AUP and the DMCA. We must still terminate in order for us to be in compliance
with safe harbor but once termination is complete, we have fulfilled our
obligation. After you reactivate them the DMCA ‘counter’ restarts; The
procedure restarts with the sending of warning letters, just like a first offense.
This is to be an unwritten semi-policy . . . We do not talk about it or give the
subscriber any indication that reactivating them is normal. Use your best
judgment and remember to do what is right for our company and subscribers. . . .
This only pertains to DMCA violations. It does not pertain to spammers, hackers,
etc.


And, based on that, the court decides that Cox does not have a "reasonably implemented" termination policy for repeat infringers. There are a bunch of other similar emails, indicating that this absolutely was Cox's policy. Of course, all of that obscures the question of whether or not 5129(i) is meant to apply to access providers, rather than online service providers.

Separately, the judge buys BMG's claim that in late 2012, Cox actually stopped terminating accounts almost entirely (leaving aside, again, that no other major access provider terminates anyone). Again, some questionable internal behavior by Cox comes back to bite them. The judge highlights a case where Cox internally kept discussing a user who was frequently accused of infringing, and who they threatened to cut off... but didn't -- even admitting it's at least partly because of the large amount of money the customer pays.

In June, a senior engineer in the abuse group said this about a customer who had been
given a final suspension and advised to remove all P2P file-sharing programs: “This customer
will likely fail again, but let’s give him one more change [sic]. [H]e pays 317.63 a month.”

The judge uses this and other examples to note that Cox knew of "repeat infringers" but didn't terminate them. Of course, the vague language of 512(i) doesn't say that you have to terminate someone as soon as you know they're repeat infringers -- just that you have a "reasonably implemented policy." However, Judge O'Grady uses these examples to suggest the policy implementation is not reasonable.

Cox's defense to that is it can't know for sure if people are infringing based solely on accusations. This is correct, but Judge O'Grady doesn't care.

Although Cox was under no duty to monitor for infringement, Cox did not have leeway
to wait until an account holder was adjudicated as an infringer to find that circumstances were
appropriate for termination. As explained above, the Court disagrees that a repeat infringer
policy applies only to those who have been held liable in a copyright suit. Rather, an account
holder must be considered an infringer, at minimum, when the service provider has actual
knowledge that the account holder is using its services for infringing purposes. Nor do service
providers have complete discretion to define “appropriate circumstances.” Appropriate
circumstances arise when an account holder is repeatedly or flagrantly infringing copyrights.
Thus, when Cox had actual knowledge of particular account holders who blatantly or repeatedly
infringed, the responsibility shifted to Cox to terminate their accounts.

That, alone is quite troubling. Kicking people off the internet based merely on accusations of infringement is really dangerous, especially given the number of false infringement allegations that we see.

The one good thing is that the court rejects BMG's troubling definition of "making available." This has been a fight that's been going on for ages. Copyright law says that one of the exclusive rights given to a copyright holder is the "distribution" right. What is not settled law at all is whether or not "making available" violates this distribution right, or if copyright holders have to show actual distribution. The courts are somewhat split on this, with O'Grady recognizing that merely making available is not distribution.

At the threshold, the Court questions the evidence relied on by those courts that
purportedly establishes that distribution is interchangeable with publication. Those courts build
upon comments in legislative history as well as an excerpt from the Supreme Court’s decision in
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises.... Legislative history
cannot override the plain meaning of “distribution” under § 106(3), however, and Harper & Row
involved a narrow discussion of first publication and not the meaning of distribution and
publication generally....

Nor does the definition of “publication” support a broader reading of the distribution
right. The Act defines “publication” as

the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other
transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute
copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution,
public performance, or public display, constitutes publication.

...The first sentence of the definition tracks the language in § 106(3), making it
clear that all distributions are publications. It does not follow from that proposition that the
inverse—all publications are distributions—is also true.... In short, § 101 provides no support for
BMG’s “making available” theory.

There's some more in the ruling, but it seems pretty clear that Cox's own internal emails and policies really sunk the company here, and out of that could come some potentially dangerous law. Some have been making a big deal over the fact that Cox's insurance company, Beazly, has filed for declaratory judgment that it's not responsible for any judgment in this case -- but again, that seems to focus on Cox's own actions, which may not apply more broadly to other providers.

Also, important is the fact that the trial still is about to go forward. Losing the safe harbor protections does not, necessarily, mean that Cox will lose the overall case, but it's an ominous start. Judge O'Grady's rulings and statements so far certainly do not bode well for the company. It's also a little bit ridiculous that O'Grady focuses so much on Cox's bad behavior, but leaves out Rightscorp's much worse behavior -- but I can see where he's coming from.

In the end, this is unfortunate and it's certain that this case will be appealed, no matter how it turns out. But the bad behavior by Cox poisons the well a bit in terms of focusing on the rather important question of what 512(i) actually means, and whether it really applies to internet access providers. As it stands right now, however, a potentially dangerous precedent could be set, whereby people could be forced to completely lose internet access based on mere accusations of copyright infringement. It's hard to believe that Congress intended such a result, but that's how Judge O'Grady is now reading the law.

Judge Mocks Public Interest Concerns About Kicking People Off Internet, Tells Cox It's Not Protected By The DMCAfrom the that's-a-problem dept
Judge Liam O'Grady -- the same guy who helped the US government take all of Kim Dotcom's stuff, is the judge handling the wacky Rightscorp-by-proxy lawsuit against Cox Communications. The key issue: Rightscorp, on behalf of BMG and Round Hill Music flooded Cox Communications with infringement notices, trying to shake loose IP addresses as part of its shake down. Cox wasn't very happy about cooperating, and in response BMG and Round Hill sued Cox, claiming that 512(i) of the DMCA requires ISPs to kick people off the internet if they're found to be "repeat infringers." Historically, it has long been believed that 512(i) does not apply to internet access/broadband providers like Cox, but rather to online service providers who are providing a direct service on the internet (like YouTube or Medium or whatever). However, the RIAA and its friends have hinted for a while that they'd like a court to interpret 512(i) to apply to internet access providers, creating a defacto "three strikes and you lose all internet access" policy. Rightscorp (with help from BMG and Round Hill Music) have decided to put that to the test.

This is a big, big deal. If the case goes against Cox, then it would create a massive problem for the public on the internet. Accusations of infringement could potentially lead to you totally losing access to the internet, which could really destroy people's lives, given how important the internet is for work and life these days. The details of the case look like they should favor Cox pretty easily. After all, Cox pointed out that Rightscorp only had licenses from the publishes, meaning they had no copyright in the sound recording -- yet they admitted to downloading the sound recording, suggesting that, if anything, Rightscorp was a mass infringer. On top of that there was pretty strong evidence that Rightscorp does not act in good faith in how it runs its shakedown practice, telling people that they have to take their computers to the police to prove their innocence (really).

Unfortunately, as Eriq Gardner reports, Judge O'Grady has ruled against Cox on a very key point: does its current policy grant it safe harbor under the DMCA. The judge said no, though we're still waiting for the full ruling as to why.

The bigger story is O'Grady's determination that there is "no genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants reasonably implemented a repeat-infringer policy as is required by §512(i) of the DMCA," granting a motion that Cox is not entitled to a safe harbor defense.

Now, just because you're not protected by the safe harbor it does not mean that you are automatically guilty of infringement. There are cases where sites have not qualified for the safe harbor and still prevailed. But it does make things more difficult and complicated and, much more importantly, opens the door to lots and lots of mischief by the RIAAs and MPAAs of the world to use this to kick people off the internet entirely based on accusations of copyright infringement. That's immensely worrisome.

O'Grady doesn't seem to think that kicking people off the internet is really a big deal. Earlier in the case, we've discovered, in the process of flat out rejecting an attempt by Public Knowledge and EFF to file an amicus brief, Judge O'Grady made his views clear:

I read the brief.
It adds absolutely nothing helpful at all. It is a combination
of describing the horrors that one endures from losing the
Internet for any length of time. Frankly, it sounded like my
son complaining when I took his electronics away when he
watched YouTube videos instead of doing homework. And it's
completely hysterical.

That's his response to two well known public interest groups explaining to him the "real world harmful effects" of Rightscorp's copyright shake-down trolling business. But he didn't want to hear any of it. Because protecting the ability of Americans to not be the subjects of extortion schemes and to enable them to communicate and work is "hysterical" and no different from kids not doing their homework because of too much YouTube.

The details here matter, but I would imagine that Cox is likely to appeal. One hopes that the appeals court is more open to listening to the concerns over copyright trolling and kicking people off the internet.

Rightscorp's Copyright Trolling Phone Script Tells Innocent People They Need To Give Their Computers To Policefrom the uh,-that's-not-how-this-works dept
We already wrote about the various filings in the Rightscorp-by-proxy lawsuit against Cox Communications. However, mixed in with all the filings are some interesting tidbits and exhibits. One that caught my eye was an exhibit revealing the "script" that Rightscorp gives its agents to use when people call in after receiving a notice. Cox Communications filed this in showing that the actual plaintiffs (BMG and Round Hill Music) "turned a blind eye" to Rightscorp's misconduct. The script is quite something, with a few ridiculous statements. The most ridiculous, however, is the following. If the caller says that they're innocent, here's how Rightscorp has its agents respond:

In order to cancel this matter without payment, you will need to go and get a police report and fax or email it to us. The police may take your devices and hold it for ~5 days to investigate the matter. You must be sure that it was not you, anyone in your household, including friends and neighbors or you will be breaking a different law with the police department.

Every part of that statement is bullshit -- and it's clearly designed to do one thing only: to frighten the caller into just paying up. To tell totally innocent people that they need to hand over their computers to the police for five days and that if anyone else used their computer to infringe that they'll be violating some sort of criminal law is downright disgusting. It just highlights that Rightscorp is in the extortion/shakedown business, rather than actually trying to stop copyright infringement.

There is plenty of evidence that Rightscorp's targeting efforts were not that accurate, and plenty of innocent people were swept up by its systems. And to then target these -- often unsophisticated -- users and tell them they have to go to the police and could be breaking the law if someone else happened to use their computer is both sleazy and dishonest.

There's a similar script for users who claim they were "hacked" which still involves having to go to the police:

Our clients appreciate that you believe you were hacked but the fact remains that we have evidence that a computer at IP address ____ has been distributing our client's
product on the BitTorrent network from __ date to as recently as ___. Your ISP confirmed that this is your account. There have been __ infringements over a period
of time..... In order to cancel this matter without payment you will need to go and get a police
report and fax or email it to us. The police may take your devices and hold them for 3-5 days to investigate the matter. You must be sure that it was not you, anyone in
your household, friends or neighbors, as you may be breaking another law with the police department. With this many infringements, the only way we can cancel the matter without payment is if you get a police report and fax it to us. If you fax us a police report, we will close the matter.

The script also includes the "usual" misleading claims, such as saying that people downloading songs have received penalties as high as $150,000. Yes, that's the maximum for statutory damages, but only for willful infringement, and such numbers have never been awarded for some random person just downloading some songs. To suggest otherwise is clearly misleading. Similarly, the script has the agents implying that Rightscorp's technology is never wrong in identifying users, and furthermore, falsely claiming that even if someone else used your WiFi network, that you are still responsible. This is in direct contrast to the actual law on the matter.

Distributing these composition on the BitTorrent network violates US Federal law 17 USC 106 which states that the copyright owner has the sole right to determine who may distribute their copyrights to the public. More than 200,000 people have been sued for doing exactly this since 2010 with penalties as high as $150,000 per infringement. We send mails to ISPs like yours (state their ISP if available) each time we see a computer
illegally distributing our client's copyrighted works. The ISP looks up which subscriber was using the IP address
at the time the infringement occurred and sends our notice to that subscriber. If you are receiving our notices, it
is because your ISP has identified you as the network that was used to illegally distribute our client's copyrighted material.
According the the Acceptable Use Policy that most ISP's have, the account holder is solely responsible for what occurs on their
network regardless of who actually committed the infringement. We are authorized by the copyright holders to extend offers of
settlement in exchange for a release of liability from the infringement. We are only contacting you while the settlement offer is
still available. At S20 per infringement, we believe this is a much more financial friendly alternative.
Would you like to settle these infringements now?

And, of course, there are all sorts of inaccuracies on little tidbits of copyright law. A copyright holder does not have the "sole right" because there are exceptions, and it's not about the distribution "of the copyrights" but rather the distribution of the work, which may be covered by copyright. Oh, and the actual statutory damages are $150,000 per work infringed rather than per infringement, which may sound like the same thing, but isn't. But those are just little inaccuracies compared to the bigger lies above.

The script also makes it clear that Rightscorp will hound you until you pay, and they threaten that your internet access may get cut off:

(Sir or Ma'am) I do need to let you know we will be continuing to contact you
with all methods possible, which will include email, regular mail and phone calls until
this is paid or our client decides to no longer offer the settlement. This is a pre-litigation communication.
Once our client has removed the settlement, we can no longer aid you in obtaining the release of liability.
This could potentially result in the suspension or termination of your internet,
escalation up to and including litigation.

It's like the classic shakedown scheme, except made to look legal thanks to US copyright law.

 Rightscorp Inc. | All You Need To Know About Their DMCA Notices      

   TorrentLawyer™ John Doe lawsuits, Malibu Media ISP Subpoenas Search  Search for:      DMCA Scare Letters, RightscorpAll I know about Rightscorp in One Page April 3, 2017 houstonlawy3r 2 Comments  RIGHTSCORP THEN AND NOWRightscorp Inc. has always been the bastard child of the RIAA. Backed by the RIAA, Rightscorp Inc. uses the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) to send DMCA copyright notices to the accused music downloaders. Rightscorp has been known to strongarm the ISPs and force them to identify the account holders who allegedly downloaded copyrighted titles belonging to Rightscorp Inc. clients.  Then, they forward these accused downloaders multiple settlement demand notices threatening that they will be sued for $150,000 per instance of copyright infringement unless they pay a measly sum of $20.RIGHTSCORP WAS THE GIANT THAT WOKE UP IN 2013Rightscorp Inc. came on my radar in June of 2013, where I wrote the article, “RIAA Giant Waking Up and Luring Defendants into Settlements.” At the time I wrote that article, I was spending a considerable amount of time helping clients who received similar notices for adult films they allegedly downloaded, but through Copyright Enforcement Group (CEG-TEK), another copyright monetization outfit.Rightscorp Inc. DMCA Letters ‘Smelled’ Like a TrapKnowing the DMCA rules and the ways copyright holders enforced them, something ‘smelled wrong’ with the Rightscorp Inc. letters. The Rightscorp Inc. company (a.k.a., “Digital Rights Corp”) itself seemed legitimate, but the way they handled their DMCA notices caused me to think that they were up to a scam. I sensed that the $20 settlement letters were a trap, and I recommended that recipients of those letters ignore them. Here is what I wrote in 2013 on the topic:“What is bothering me, however, is that the release on their https://secure.digitalrightscorp.com/settle website (pasted below) releases the accused defendant from their claim of copyright infringement for a mere $20, but it has the defendant ADMITTING GUILT to the infringement. Thus, in legal terms, an accused internet user who pays the $20 may be released from liability for THAT instance of infringement, but the next time they catch that user downloading, they can not only sue for the full $150,000 (or ask for TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS as a settlement), but in court, they would use the prior settlement as EVIDENCE OF GUILT that the accused defendant habitually downloads copyrighted videos and TV shows.To be clear: EVERY settlement agreement for copyright infringement should have language stating that the accused defendant is not admitting guilt, or else the act of settling a copyright infringement claim can be construed as an “admission” of guilt in a court. Specifically, the language (e.g., taken from CEG-TEK’s settlements) would say something like “this Liability Release represents a compromise and that nothing herein is to be construed as an admission of liability on the part of RELEASEE.” This language appears to be purposefully ABSENT from the RightsCorp Settlement Agreements.”Rightscorp Inc. DMCA Settlement Notices Ended Up Being A TrapI worried that a client who settled a Rightscorp Inc. copyright infringement notice subjected himself to future claims of copyright infringements. Every settlement was an admission of guilt, and it turned out that Rightscorp Inc. sent many follow-up DMCA notices to the individual who paid their $20 fee.Pay One Notice, Receive Twenty MoreThose who paid the DMCA settlement notices on their own often ended up calling me when they received twenty more DMCA settlement notices. For a while, I thought that this was part of their elaborate plan of eliciting hundreds of dollars from each defendant rather than a one-time payment of $20. Unlike CEG-TEK, who at the time would list all of the alleged claims against a particular user in real time (based on the IP addresses they allegedly used to download the copyrighted content), Rightscorp Inc. asked for one settlement at a time, and when you settled one, there was often another one right behind it.The Rightscorp scam in my opinion did not start until Rightscorp Inc. started to ask its users for settlements in the thousands of dollars. While the numbers never matched CEG-TEK settlements (where CEG-TEK was asking for $300 per title), Rightscorp settlement numbers often found themselves hovering near the $900-$1,800 range.Settling ONE Instance Of Infringement vs. Settling All Past Downloads of a TitleThe reason Rightscorp was able to increase their settlement amounts was because each settlement was for “one instance of copyright infringement,” which means that if a user downloaded the file twice, they had to pay twice. If they left their bittorrent software on overnight, and that bittorrent software seeded 20 copies of a title to 20 downloaders, that accused downloader would be accused of 20 more instances of infringement.This was very different from CEG-TEK, who allowed their settlements to cover “all past instances of infringement regarding that copyrighted title.”Rightscorp Inc. Then Used Settlements To Force ISPs To Shut AccountsRightscorp then used the admissions of guilt within the settlement agreements to attempt to strongarm the ISPs to shut down their internet accounts.I always thought this was a petty move. I understood that there were some politicians behind the Digital Rights Corp / Rightscorp entity, and that those politicians had no idea how to run a company (which is why Rightscorp stock has been worth only a few pennies for years now). I also understood that Rightscorp Inc. motives were not [at first] to extort money from the accused downloaders such as a copyright troll would, but rather, they wanted to protect their music labels and stop piracy.I understand and respect a company who legitimately tries to stop piracy, but Rightscorp Inc. went about it in the wrong way. I always thought that Rightscorp pressuring the ISPs to shut down the internet accounts of those who paid a settlement ransom was vindictive. To me, it just showed the callous disregard for the power Rightscorp wielded like a child who swings a light saber at his infant unsuspecting brother.Then Rightscorp Inc. Started Robocalling Accused DownloadersRightscorp then started ‘robocalling’ accused downloaders. They did it recklessly — again, think of a child whacking his infant brother with a lightsaber — and they broke a whole slew of laws in the process. In addition, they called at all hours of the night, and because the company was in my opinion a ‘headless’ company, meaning that there was nobody to call to complain or help resolve a situation, the Rightscorp harassment issues only got worse. Eventually they were sued in a class action lawsuit and had to pay a hefty settlement for their robocalling shenanigans.Then Rightscorp Inc. Started Suing Accused Downloaders For $150,000I must admit, I lost interest in the Rightscorp shenanigans after I noted that their settlement agreements do not protect the legal rights of those who settle because their settlements amounted to admissions of guilt. Thus, when someone asked me “Should I pay Rightscorp Inc.?” my answer was “not without a valid release that doesn’t have you admitting guilt.”However, there was a point that Rightscorp Inc. started filing copyright infringement lawsuits against accused music downloaders in federal court. Each accused defendant was sued for $150,000 statutory damages for the unlawful download of the various music titles they allegedly downloaded via bittorrent.Rightscorp defendants deceptively are not told that it is Rightscorp who is suing them.  Rather, they will receive a subpoena relating to some ‘motion to compel’ that they have filed in a federal court.  Their subpoenas force the ISP to hand over account information to a place called “Inquest Resources” at 807 Brazos Street, Suite 805 in Austin, TX.  The subpoenas usually come with a Declaration by Dennis J. Hawk of the Business Law Group under the 17 USC 512(h) statute.I don’t have much to say here, except that Jordan Rushie was one of the attorneys who was hired by Rightscorp to file the lawsuits. If I was looking for it, the Jordan Rushie connection with Carl Crowell and RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT was something that I did not make until writing “The Great MPAA/RIAA Scheme To Defraud Copyright Law” in March, 2017).Rightscorp Then. Reckless Copyright Troll.All I could say about Rightscorp is that is has been a trainwreck. First with the bad settlement agreements. Then with the unruly wielding of power to shut down ISP accounts of infringers. Then the ‘headless’ robocalls. Then the copyright infringement lawsuits. Rightscorp was a reckless copyright troll, and I always sensed that the leadership was delegating orders the management simply could not carry out.  To make matters worse, Rightscorp was in financial ruin (at one point before what appears to have been a ‘cash infusion’ which brought them out of their consistent negative cashflow), and I used to refer to Rightscorp as a “sinking ship.”Rightscorp Now. Efficient Copyright TrollRightscorp in recent years has made a number of changes, graduating them from a reckless copyright troll to an efficient copyright troll. In recent years, they have revamped their settlement agreements where there is no longer an admission of guilt. They also now have a contact for an attorney such as myself to speak to. That way, if I have a client who is in trouble and wants to pay significantly less that they were accused of, or if my client wants to settle anonymously, at least now I have someone in Rightscorp I can speak to in order to make this happen.I have to assume they are still filing in the federal courts, although their lawsuits do not get nearly the amount of publicity as other copyright troll lawsuits do, probably because they are going after individual defendants, and are suing in the name of the music copyright holder. Settlements are no longer $20 per instance of infringement, but are now $30 per instance of infringement. This is a 50% increase in their profits, but for you or me, it’s another $10 which thankfully is not $3,500 (the going asking rate to settle movie download lawsuits with CEG-TEK’s out-of-court DMCA settlement letters was $300/title). Most importantly, they have stayed off the radar and have kept out of trouble.From the perspective of running our Cashman Law Firm, PLLC, in the past, we used to decline representing Rightscorp clients because their settlement agreements did not protect the interests of our clients.  However, with 1) the improvements in their settlement agreements in eliminating admissions of guilt, 2) the ability to anonymously protect our clients’ interests, 3) negotiate the dollar amount of the settlements, and 4) the ability to negotiate the settlement agreement itself to tailor it to the needs of our clients, today, our firm does represent Rightscorp clients.However, doing so does not come with a bit of awkwardness.  When representing a client in a CEG-TEK DMCA settlement demand notice, clients would come with 3-20 notices (and at $300/claim, the settlement asking price was $900-$6,000 before settlement negotiations).  Thus, representing a client and having the client pay our fees made sense.Not necessarily so with a Rightscorp client who received those same 3-20 notices.  At $30/claim, the settlement asking price would be $90-$600 (before settlement negotiations).  Thus, depending on the number of notices, there could be a disproportionate payment to our law firm to handle what could be a $30 problem.For more on this topic, click the “Rightscorp settlement attorney considerations for a set of DMCA notices” article, here.How To Handle a Rightscorp Notice TodayRightscorp Inc. is still a failing company (from the point of view of corporate earnings and management). However, from the point of view of an accused downloader of a Jethro Tull music album, or some other piece of music, you must assume that failing to settle could put you at risk of being sued for copyright infringement in federal court. All this being said, when you receive the letter, the Rightscorp problem still small, and can be managed with the assistance of a lawyer (myself or anyone else).How An Attorney Would Represent You In Resolving Your Rightscorp Matter[NOTE: For credibility purposes, be aware that since 2013, I recommended that if Rightscorp is unwilling to protect your interests in a settle, do not settle. If you get sued, hire an attorney (again, me, or someone else) because Rightscorp lawsuits likely have the same Guardaley “no evidence” problem I described here). Now that Rightscorp Inc. is willing to help me protect your interests in a settlement, I am willing to settle Rightscorp cases for clients.] Here is why to retain a lawyer, and what we would do for you.  (Below, when I speak of “you,” I am speaking in a general way. I do not become your attorney (nor should this be considered legal advice) until we sign a contract together.)Next Step: Schedule a ConsultationFollow the three steps below to begin working with a Cashman Law Firm, PLLC patent attorney:1. Schedule a phone appointment to speak to a patent attorney about your matter.2. Get, sign, and return retainer agreement.3. Sit back, relax, and let us work on your behalf to get you the results you need.After scheduling your appointment online, you will be contacted by phone at the specified date and time by a Cashman Law Firm, PLLC attorney.Anonymous SettlementRemember, when you receive the DMCA notice from your internet provider, you are anonymous, AND YOU SHOULD STAY THAT WAY. Rightscorp has enough of a history to have me recommend that every client of mine who settles does so ANONYMOUSLY.Stop Rightscorp From Sending Additional DMCA Notices After a SettlementThere should be a legal barrier between you and Rightscorp, and hiring an attorney and having me put them on notice that I am representing your account stops them from contacting you in the future. Also, any future communications (or additional DMCA notices) should come through me, as I am the attorney representing you. By having me represent you, we ‘discourage’ Rightscorp from sending any additional DMCA notices after a settlement is complete. Rather, we ask them to research to see whether there are any outstanding titles claimed against you, and we would include them in the settlement negotiations.Negotiate the Settlement, Facilitate the Anonymous PaymentYou would have me review and negotiate the claims with Rightscorp. When they agree to lower the price to something you are comfortable paying, I would facilitate the settlement to make it an ANONYMOUS SETTLEMENT.Review Release of LiabilityThis is an obvious step to be done before we pay the settlement on your behalf. I am giving this section its own heading because sometimes, custom terms need to be inserted into the Rightscorp agreements to protect a client’s interests. This would be part of the settlement negotiations (above).Handle Any Follow-Up Communications From RightscorpThis last step happens after the settlement is complete, and we do not charge our clients for this. When we settle the claims, we settle them as an “Anonymous Client” of the Cashman Law Firm, PLLC (using our law firm’s address and e-mail). That way, they have our information on file should they have any follow-up questions.After a settlement is complete, in the past, Rightscorp has been known to send additional DMCA notices asking for more money. With our clients, this has not been the case because we ask them to include all claims in the settlement negotiations we do on our client’s behalf. However, should Rightscorp have a question about a settlement, or should a new matter occur, we will speak to them and handle any needed follow-up communications on your behalf, even after we have closed your file. Should any communication occur relating to a matter we have already settled anonymously on your behalf, I will be sure to let you know.Next Step: Schedule a ConsultationFollow the three steps below to begin working with a Cashman Law Firm, PLLC patent attorney:1.

Tweet Share1 Share +1 PinShares 1    2 thoughts on “All I know about Rightscorp in One Page” I’m confused….in rightscorp’s case, isn’t it the clients they represent that would have to “sue” or pursue an infringer in court not rightscorp itself? Reply  The copyright holders themselves would be the ones that would ordinarily file the lawsuits for themselves. However, as we see with Voltage Pictures (who sued as Dallas Buyers Club) and the Guardaley lawsuits, there are ‘common troll’ entities who license the rights to enforce other people’s copyrights. Rightscorp can thus contract the rights to enforce and sue on behalf of their client, the copyright holders. You will correctly point out that this could cause a number of issues (e.g., doesn’t the person suing need to have the copyright, etc.), and the answer is yes. Thus, the lawsuits would not have Rightscorp as the plaintiff. Reply     Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
