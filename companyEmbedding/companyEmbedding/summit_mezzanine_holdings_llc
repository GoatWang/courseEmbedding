ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC

In October 2008, Energy Capital announced the formation of ADA Carbon Solutions (“ACS”) to develop and construct an activated carbon (“AC”) production facility in Coushatta, Louisiana.


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








ACS was formed in anticipation of federal and state regulations requiring mercury removal from coal-fired power plant emissions. ACS designed and built what Energy Capital believes is the largest, most automated and most environmentally friendly AC manufacturing plant in North America focused on mitigating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The facility, which is called Red River, was completed in 2010, can produce 150 million pounds per year of AC and has begun shipping product to utility customers. In addition, ACS developed its own dedicated source of raw material, the Five Forks Mine, located in close proximity to the Red River plant.
 
In December 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) released its final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”), which set stringent new federal limits on hazardous emissions from the nation’s coal and oil-fired power plants. After a few delays, the rule went into full effect for all U.S. coal plants in April 2016.

STEAG SCR-Tech

In August 2011, Energy Capital acquired CoaLogix, the established leader in selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) management services and catalyst regeneration technologies used by coal-fired power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. In January 2016, CoaLogix merged with competitor STEAG Energy Services, forming STEAG SCR-Tech. 


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








STEAG SCR-Tech provides innovative, cost-effective solutions that help utility customers achieve and maintain compliance with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. SCR is the leading control technology for reducing NOx emissions from coal-fired power plants worldwide. Within an SCR system, power plant flue gas reacts with a catalyst enabling a chemical reaction to transform NOx emissions into environmentally friendly, nitrogen and water vapor. Over time, catalysts in the SCR system must be replaced or regenerated to maintain effective NOx reduction. Through its proprietary processes, STEAG SCR-Tech regenerates deactivated catalysts at a substantial discount relative to the replacement cost of catalysts, while also eliminating the need for catalyst disposal and catalyst inventory storage. With operations in China and a large European customer base, STEAG SCR-Tech provides a vital global service for reducing coal plant emissions.For more information about STEAG SCR-Tech, visit the company’s website at www.steagscrtech.com/us-home.

Sunnova Energy Corp.

In March 2016, ECP closed an investment in Sunnova Energy Corp., a leading residential solar company. Sunnova finances, operates and manages residential solar systems for customers primarily in the United States. The company is headquartered in Houston, Texas.


Renewable Energy


Current








Sunnova currently operates throughout the United States and is in the business of acquiring and managing residential solar projects with 25-year contracts. Sunnova’s business model relies on an extensive network of regional channel partners for originating, developing and servicing systems. The market for residential solar developers and installers in the United States is highly fragmented owing to localized regulations, permitting processes, and customer demographics. By enabling Sunnova’s channel partners to creatively grow their business and customer base, we believe that Sunnova’s partnering model results in a lower cost and more efficient origination approach.
 
The distributed solar sector has been rapidly expanding, driven by significant declines in solar project installation costs, rising utility rates, greater customer choice and state and federal environmental regulations supporting carbon-free and distributed electricity.
