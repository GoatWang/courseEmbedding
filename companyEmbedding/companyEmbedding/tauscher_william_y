Ellen O'Kane Tauscher (born November 15, 1951) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who was the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district from 1997 until her resignation in 2009 upon joining the State Department, where she served as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs until February 2012. She then served as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the State Department until August 31, 2012.
A Blue Dog Democrat, Tauscher is a centrist on many issues and is notably a war hawk.[1] Since leaving the State Department, Tauscher has assumed a number of publicly held corporate and non-profit board positions, including serving on the boards of Southern California Edison, Invacare, The Commonwealth Club of California, and the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council. Tauscher also serves on the board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation.

Early life and career[edit]
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[2] She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.[3]
She then worked as an investment banker with Bache & Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[3] She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers.[4] She also published The ChildCare Sourcebook and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.[5]
Political career[edit]
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser[6] and also chaired Dianne Feinstein's successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.
In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California's 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military.[7] She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control.[8] She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote.[9] The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year's 435 House races.[10]
Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered "solid Republican territory,"[8] most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level since the 1990s.
In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher's district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano county. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.
In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country's nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.[11] From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.[12]




Adam Mount, Ellen Tauscher, Rebecca Hersman, John R. Harvey and Kori Schake at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Project on Nuclear Issues and Ploughshares Fund panel discussion, "Debate: U.S. Nuclear Weapon Modernization", Washington, D.C., 29 June 2017


On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009 by unanimous consent.[13] Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill.[14] Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy & Security Act.[15] Her resignation necessitated a special election.[16] Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012 as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.
As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010.[17] The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).[18] The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President's deployment timeline to be met.[19]
In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for President. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton's campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort that has now grown to be one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.[20]
Career after politics[edit]
In 2012, Tauscher returned to the private sector, joining the boards of a number of publicly held corporations, including Invacare Corporation, ehealth, Inc, Edison International and Southern California Edison, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She also serves as an independent member of the Board of Governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC and Los Alamos National Security LLC; a member of the Board of Directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and is chairman of the Board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.
In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson.[21] The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.
Tauscher also serves as a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.
Tauscher is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.[22]
Political views[edit]
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005. Her politically moderate ideology was dubbed "Tauscherism" by Time magazine.[8]
Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union,[23] and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.[24]
While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).[25] She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.[7]
Abortion[edit]
Tauscher is strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL.[26] She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.
She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.
Gun rights[edit]
Tauscher is in favor of more extensive gun control. She has expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that "we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence." She has called for "common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public."
While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials.[27] She received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[28]
Iraq war[edit]
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585[29]). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the "Iraqi government takes increased responsibility" for its political and security needs.[30] She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days[26] and even to impeach President Bush over the war.[31]
LGBT issues[edit]
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, "It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage."[32] In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.[26]
On March 3, 2009 Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Tauscher lives in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former Chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc.,[33] and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate.[34] She has a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).[5]
On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary she married retired airline pilot Jim Cieslak.[35] They divorced in 2011.
In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer of the esophagus.[36] Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 10%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Since that time, she has been active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

Ellen O'Kane Tauscher (born November 15, 1951) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who was the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district from 1997 until her resignation in 2009 upon joining the State Department, where she served as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs until February 2012. She then served as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the State Department until August 31, 2012.
A Blue Dog Democrat, Tauscher is a centrist on many issues and is notably a war hawk.[1] Since leaving the State Department, Tauscher has assumed a number of publicly held corporate and non-profit board positions, including serving on the boards of Southern California Edison, Invacare, The Commonwealth Club of California, and the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council.

Early life and career[edit]
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[2] She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.[3]
She then worked as an investment banker with Bache & Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[3] She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers.[4] She also published The ChildCare Sourcebook and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.[5]
Political career[edit]
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser[6] and also chaired Dianne Feinstein's successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.
In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California's 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military.[7] She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control.[8] She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote.[9] The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year's 435 House races.[10]
Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered "solid Republican territory,"[8] most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level since the 1990s.
In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher's district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano county. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.
In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country's nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.[11] From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.[12]

On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009 by unanimous consent.[13] Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill.[14] Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy & Security Act.[15] Her resignation necessitated a special election.[16] Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012 as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.
As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010.[17] The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).[18] The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President's deployment timeline to be met.[19]
In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for President. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton's campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort that has now grown to be one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.[20]
Career after politics[edit]
In 2012, Tauscher returned to the private sector, joining the boards of a number of publicly held corporations, including Invacare Corporation, ehealth, Inc, Edison International and Southern California Edison, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She also serves as an independent member of the Board of Governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC and Los Alamos National Security LLC; a member of the Board of Directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and is chairman of the Board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.
In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson.[21] The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.
Tauscher also serves as a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.
Tauscher is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.[22]
Political views[edit]
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005. Her politically moderate ideology was dubbed "Tauscherism" by Time magazine.[8]
Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union,[23] and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.[24]
While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).[25] She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.[7]
Abortion[edit]
Tauscher is strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL.[26] She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.
She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.
Gun rights[edit]
Tauscher is in favor of more extensive gun control. She has expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that "we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence." She has called for "common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public."
While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials.[27] She received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[28]
Iraq war[edit]
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585[29]). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the "Iraqi government takes increased responsibility" for its political and security needs.[30] She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days[26] and even to impeach President Bush over the war.[31]
LGBT issues[edit]
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, "It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage."[32] In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.[26]
On March 3, 2009 Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Tauscher lives in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former Chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc.,[33] and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate.[34] She has a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).[5]
On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary she married retired airline pilot Jim Cieslak.[35] They divorced in 2011.
In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer of the esophagus.[36] Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 10%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Since that time, she has been active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

Ellen O'Kane Tauscher (born November 15, 1951) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who was the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district from 1997 until her resignation in 2009 upon joining the State Department, where she served as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs until February 2012. She then served as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the State Department until August 31, 2012.
A Blue Dog Democrat, Tauscher is a centrist on many issues and is notably a war hawk.[1] Since leaving the State Department, Tauscher has assumed a number of publicly held corporate and non-profit board positions, including serving on the boards of Southern California Edison, Invacare, The Commonwealth Club of California, and the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council. Tauscher also serves on the board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation.

Early life and career[edit]
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[2] She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.[3]
She then worked as an investment banker with Bache & Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[3] She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers.[4] She also published The ChildCare Sourcebook and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.[5]
Political career[edit]
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser[6] and also chaired Dianne Feinstein's successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.
In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California's 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military.[7] She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control.[8] She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote.[9] The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year's 435 House races.[10]
Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered "solid Republican territory,"[8] most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level since the 1990s.
In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher's district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano county. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.
In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country's nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.[11] From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.[12]

On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009 by unanimous consent.[13] Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill.[14] Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy & Security Act.[15] Her resignation necessitated a special election.[16] Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012 as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.
As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010.[17] The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).[18] The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President's deployment timeline to be met.[19]
In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for President. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton's campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort that has now grown to be one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.[20]
Career after politics[edit]
In 2012, Tauscher returned to the private sector, joining the boards of a number of publicly held corporations, including Invacare Corporation, ehealth, Inc, Edison International and Southern California Edison, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She also serves as an independent member of the Board of Governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC and Los Alamos National Security LLC; a member of the Board of Directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and is chairman of the Board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.
In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson.[21] The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.
Tauscher also serves as a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.
Tauscher is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.[22]
Political views[edit]
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005. Her politically moderate ideology was dubbed "Tauscherism" by Time magazine.[8]
Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union,[23] and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.[24]
While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).[25] She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.[7]
Abortion[edit]
Tauscher is strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL.[26] She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.
She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.
Gun rights[edit]
Tauscher is in favor of more extensive gun control. She has expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that "we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence." She has called for "common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public."
While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials.[27] She received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[28]
Iraq war[edit]
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585[29]). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the "Iraqi government takes increased responsibility" for its political and security needs.[30] She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days[26] and even to impeach President Bush over the war.[31]
LGBT issues[edit]
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, "It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage."[32] In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.[26]
On March 3, 2009 Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Tauscher lives in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former Chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc.,[33] and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate.[34] She has a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).[5]
On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary she married retired airline pilot Jim Cieslak.[35] They divorced in 2011.
In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer of the esophagus.[36] Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 10%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Since that time, she has been active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

Ellen O'Kane Tauscher (born November 15, 1951) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who was the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district from 1997 until her resignation in 2009 upon joining the State Department, where she served as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs until February 2012. She then served as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the State Department until August 31, 2012.
A Blue Dog Democrat, Tauscher is a centrist on many issues and is notably a war hawk.[1] Since leaving the State Department, Tauscher has assumed a number of publicly held corporate and non-profit board positions, including serving on the boards of Southern California Edison, Invacare, The Commonwealth Club of California, and the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council. Tauscher also serves on the board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation.

Early life and career[edit]
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[2] She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.[3]
She then worked as an investment banker with Bache & Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[3] She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers.[4] She also published The ChildCare Sourcebook and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.[5]
Political career[edit]
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser[6] and also chaired Dianne Feinstein's successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.
In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California's 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military.[7] She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control.[8] She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote.[9] The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year's 435 House races.[10]
Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered "solid Republican territory,"[8] most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level since the 1990s.
In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher's district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano county. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.
In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country's nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.[11] From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.[12]

On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009 by unanimous consent.[13] Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill.[14] Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy & Security Act.[15] Her resignation necessitated a special election.[16] Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012 as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.
As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010.[17] The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).[18] The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President's deployment timeline to be met.[19]
In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for President. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton's campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort that has now grown to be one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.[20]
Career after politics[edit]
In 2012, Tauscher returned to the private sector, joining the boards of a number of publicly held corporations, including Invacare Corporation, ehealth, Inc, Edison International and Southern California Edison, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She also serves as an independent member of the Board of Governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC and Los Alamos National Security LLC; a member of the Board of Directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and is chairman of the Board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.
In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson.[21] The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.
Tauscher also serves as a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.
Tauscher is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.[22]
Political views[edit]
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005. Her politically moderate ideology was dubbed "Tauscherism" by Time magazine.[8]
Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union,[23] and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.[24]
While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).[25] She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.[7]
Abortion[edit]
Tauscher is strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL.[26] She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.
She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.
Gun rights[edit]
Tauscher is in favor of more extensive gun control. She has expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that "we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence." She has called for "common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public."
While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials.[27] She received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[28]
Iraq war[edit]
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585[29]). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the "Iraqi government takes increased responsibility" for its political and security needs.[30] She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days[26] and even to impeach President Bush over the war.[31]
LGBT issues[edit]
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, "It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage."[32] In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.[26]
On March 3, 2009 Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Tauscher lives in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former Chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc.,[33] and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate.[34] She has a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).[5]
On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary she married retired airline pilot Jim Cieslak.[35] They divorced in 2011.
In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer of the esophagus.[36] Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 10%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Since that time, she has been active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

Ellen O'Kane Tauscher (born November 15, 1951) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who was the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district from 1997 until her resignation in 2009 upon joining the State Department, where she served as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs until February 2012. She then served as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the State Department until August 31, 2012.
A Blue Dog Democrat, Tauscher is a centrist on many issues and is notably a war hawk.[1] Since leaving the State Department, Tauscher has assumed a number of publicly held corporate and non-profit board positions, including serving on the boards of Southern California Edison, Invacare, The Commonwealth Club of California, and the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council. Tauscher also serves on the board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation.

Early life and career[edit]
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[2] She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.[3]
She then worked as an investment banker with Bache & Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[3] She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers.[4] She also published The ChildCare Sourcebook and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.[5]
Political career[edit]
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser[6] and also chaired Dianne Feinstein's successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.
In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California's 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military.[7] She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control.[8] She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote.[9] The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year's 435 House races.[10]
Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered "solid Republican territory,"[8] most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level since the 1990s.
In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher's district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano county. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.
In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country's nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.[11] From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.[12]

On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009 by unanimous consent.[13] Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill.[14] Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy & Security Act.[15] Her resignation necessitated a special election.[16] Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012 as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.
As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010.[17] The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).[18] The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President's deployment timeline to be met.[19]
In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for President. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton's campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort that has now grown to be one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.[20]
Career after politics[edit]
In 2012, Tauscher returned to the private sector, joining the boards of a number of publicly held corporations, including Invacare Corporation, ehealth, Inc, Edison International and Southern California Edison, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She also serves as an independent member of the Board of Governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC and Los Alamos National Security LLC; a member of the Board of Directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and is chairman of the Board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.
In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson.[21] The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.
Tauscher also serves as a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.
Tauscher is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.[22]
Political views[edit]
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005. Her politically moderate ideology was dubbed "Tauscherism" by Time magazine.[8]
Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union,[23] and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.[24]
While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).[25] She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.[7]
Abortion[edit]
Tauscher is strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL.[26] She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.
She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.
Gun rights[edit]
Tauscher is in favor of more extensive gun control. She has expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that "we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence." She has called for "common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public."
While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials.[27] She received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[28]
Iraq war[edit]
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585[29]). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the "Iraqi government takes increased responsibility" for its political and security needs.[30] She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days[26] and even to impeach President Bush over the war.[31]
LGBT issues[edit]
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, "It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage."[32] In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.[26]
On March 3, 2009 Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Tauscher lives in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former Chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc.,[33] and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate.[34] She has a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).[5]
On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary she married retired airline pilot Jim Cieslak.[35] They divorced in 2011.
In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer of the esophagus.[36] Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 10%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Since that time, she has been active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

Early life and career[edit]
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.[2] She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.[3]
She then worked as an investment banker with Bache & Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[3] She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers.[4] She also published The ChildCare Sourcebook and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.[5]
Political career[edit]
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser[6] and also chaired Dianne Feinstein's successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.
In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California's 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military.[7] She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control.[8] She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote.[9] The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year's 435 House races.[10]
Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered "solid Republican territory,"[8] most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level since the 1990s.
In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher's district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano county. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.
In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country's nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee.[11] From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.[12]

On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009 by unanimous consent.[13] Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill.[14] Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy & Security Act.[15] Her resignation necessitated a special election.[16] Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012 as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.
As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010.[17] The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010 and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).[18] The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President's deployment timeline to be met.[19]
In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for President. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton's campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort that has now grown to be one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.[20]
Career after politics[edit]
In 2012, Tauscher returned to the private sector, joining the boards of a number of publicly held corporations, including Invacare Corporation, ehealth, Inc, Edison International and Southern California Edison, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She also serves as an independent member of the Board of Governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC and Los Alamos National Security LLC; a member of the Board of Directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and is chairman of the Board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.
In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson.[21] The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.
Tauscher also serves as a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.
Tauscher is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.[22]
Political views[edit]
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005. Her politically moderate ideology was dubbed "Tauscherism" by Time magazine.[8]
Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union,[23] and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.[24]
While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).[25] She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.[7]
Abortion[edit]
Tauscher is strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL.[26] She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.
She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.
Gun rights[edit]
Tauscher is in favor of more extensive gun control. She has expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that "we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence." She has called for "common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public."
While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials.[27] She received an F rating from the National Rifle Association.[28]
Iraq war[edit]
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585[29]). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the "Iraqi government takes increased responsibility" for its political and security needs.[30] She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days[26] and even to impeach President Bush over the war.[31]
LGBT issues[edit]
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush's call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, "It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage."[32] In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.[26]
On March 3, 2009 Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Tauscher lives in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former Chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc.,[33] and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate.[34] She has a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).[5]
On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary she married retired airline pilot Jim Cieslak.[35] They divorced in 2011.
In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer of the esophagus.[36] Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 10%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Since that time, she has been active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as Chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

When William (Bill) Y. Tauscher was an undergraduate at Yale, he negotiated with local merchants to create a discount card for students. Decades later, the Yale discount program still is going strong, and Tauscher is still working with retailers—now as chairman and CEO of Blackhawk Network.
“That began my entrepreneurial career … There’s nothing greater than entrepreneurialism,” says Tauscher, who has spent his career building companies, making them more profitable and taking some of them public. “Business makes the world go ’round,” he adds, “and I like very much being able to play a significant role in providing the direction and in building a team.”




In His Own Words
In five years prepaid will be “morphing in ways we do not understand today, other than knowing that the digital revolution will be the major force for change.”
The prepaid industry must “make sure it’s always answering a consumer need in everything it does to keep growing.”
Mobile payments “will be a battle fundamentally to own a digitized wallet that can provide an enhanced consumer shopping experience.”
The most exciting part of my job is “personally engaging with the business partners that make up our network.”
If I’m not in the office, “I’m spending time with family or exercising.”




Tauscher started his professional career at IBM in the retail and distribution division, but since the age of 28 has been his own boss. He has acquired and grown several private and public companies, including Foxmeyer, Vertical Communications, Coast America (acquired by True Value) and Vanstar Corporation. He also served as managing member of the TauscherGroup, a company that invests and assists in the management of enterprises. And, he continues to sit on the board of several companies. 
Moving toward Autonomy
Tauscher took the reins as CEO of Blackhawk in August of 2010, although he began serving as executive chairman in 2009, coming in a few days a week and working with then-CEO Don Kingsborough on moving the company toward independence.
“I’ve helped several private companies substantially grow and have taken four companies public. This was a role I was well-suited for,” he says. Tauscher could not give details about a possible Blackhawk spinoff from parent Safeway, although it’s something Safeway CEO Steven A. Burd has been open about in earnings calls. But Tauscher did say the company has been making investments to strengthen its independence. “All of our processing platforms are now our own, we have our own duplexed data centers with a high-availability setup. We have our own financials and our own audits,” he explains. “Those things are important for this business, which is very different from the grocery retail business.”
When he talks about Blackhawk’s future and that of the prepaid industry, Tauscher becomes animated. “We view our focus to be in sync with the hot and growing areas,” he says. Although Blackhawk’s PayPower products are in the spotlight-stealing general purpose reloadable (GPR) segment, he begins by talking about the company’s explosive growth in gift. “We have to start with our gift card business. It’s growing even faster than some of the market leaders in the GPR space,” he notes. The strong double-digit growth is largely coming from same-store sales, although Blackhawk continues to add new locations as well. “We’re continuing to expand, and our retailers are giving more floor space to gift cards and we’re working with them to increase their promotional activity. “We’re spending significant marketing dollars and have proven these expansions are profitable,” he says.
In addition, Tauscher stresses the importance of execution and “getting back to basics.” “In a business like ours, the basics of in-store merchandising, marketing and promotion cannot be understated.”
It’s that focus that is forging Blackhawk’s presence overseas as well, where the company is achieving three times the growth of its domestic business.
Another growth area Tauscher has his eye on is prepaid wireless minutes and phones. “One in five wireless phones is now a prepaid program with no contract,” he says. “This is the market that’s getting all the growth, and it’s predicted to move up to one in three.” As such, Blackhawk is stepping up its efforts in the prepaid wireless arena and providing large destination displays with a broad handset offering in many of its partner locations.
Midwestern Roots
Tauscher attributes his business acumen to being a pragmatist with an analytical mind, something he inherited from his parents. His dad worked for Caterpillar for years and his mother was a school teacher. Both prized logic.
The family—Tauscher has two brothers—moved around a lot. Tauscher was born in Washington, D.C., but didn’t stay long. And although he lived as far west as Montana, Tauscher claims the Midwest as his home. He spent his high school years in Peoria, Ill., and was the first from his public high school to go to an Ivy League college.
Today, Tauscher makes his home in northern California with his wife, who runs two businesses they own, including a consumer goods company and a gym. He has five children—two business owners in their early 30s who live in Dallas, one who just graduated college and two still in college.
When asked about his career, Tauscher says he’s known since age 5 that he wanted to be a CEO.
“My background has been in retail distribution and technology, but at the end of the day, it’s all about execution,” he notes. “If you think about the fundamentals of prepaid—we often get caught up in the product, its features and its functions—how you acquire customers, how you take care of those customers, who your partners are and how you manage your whole online presence, those are the things that determine the success of anybody in prepaid.
“You can have a great strategy, but what wins in business is out-executing your competitors.”

Tauscher Filing for What Promises to Be a Messy Divorce


Phillip Matier, Andrew Ross


        Published 4:00 am, Wednesday, March 10, 1999
    
































































1999-03-10 04:00:00 PDT CONTRA COSTA -- Political life has taken its toll on more than a few Washington marriages, but those in the know say that wasn't the case with Representative Ellen Tauscher of Contra Costa County, who has stunned supporters by filing for divorce from her husband of seven years, multimillionaire William Tauscher. 
"This is not a product of her going to Washington," insists one friend of Tauscher. 
What is publicly known is that William Tauscher has admitted having an affair -- and there apparently were signs that not all was well in paradise even before his Democratic wife unseated Republican Bill Baker back in 1996.

"I'm not surprised in the least," said the source we spoke to. "There were indications that this marital trouble was going on back then." 
Still, William Tauscher, a Republican, was regularly seen at his wife's side throughout the campaign, and he contributed $1.6 million to her winning effort. 
And from the looks of things, his money apparently played a big role in the couple's lifestyle as well -- which included a Washington townhouse on embassy row valued at $1.7 million and a home in the Tassajara Valley, valued at $2.2 million. 
As Tauscher said of her husband in her divorce papers: "Bill has always insisted that we 'live large.' He always ensured that we traveled first-class, stayed in five-star hotels, stayed in suites rather than just regular rooms, ordered caviar at restaurants rather than regular appetizers, drank Crystal, not just ordinary champagne, and paid the tab at each and every meal regardless of who we were with or how many people were dining with us." 
(William Tauscher said their lifestyle was "established mutually." He also corrected his wife on another detail: He drank Dom Perignon, not Crystal.) 
The messy divorce is not only a personal embarrassment for Tauscher, but also a potential political liability if details of the split are dragged out until the next election cycle. 
However, few details of the split are spared in divorce papers. 
The couple's descent from Cloud Nine began in November 1997 when Ellen Tauscher visited the Atlanta home where her husband stayed on business for his computer company, Vanstar, and found a card from one of her husband's female employees. 
She also found a photograph of hubby and the other woman at New York's famous Rainbow Room, where the Tauschers themselves were married July 15, 1989. 
Tauscher said that when she pressed her husband about the photo, he admitted he was having an affair. 
Tauscher said she failed to persuade her husband to stick with counseling to save the marriage -- and hence the divorce. 
Tauscher now wants to depose the other woman to find out whether her husband was funneling a significant amount of the family income into gifts and entertainment for his girlfriend. 
Tauscher, a former stockbroker, claims she knew little of the couple's financial affairs, including her husband's assertion that their family bookkeeper had embezzled millions from them. 
Tauscher, who earns $135,000 a year as a member of Congress, is asking for at least $30,000 a month in spousal support and support for the couple's daughter. 
Her attorney, Robert Nachshin of Los Angeles (who also represented Giants slugger Barry Bonds in his recent divorce), said the case is so complicated that documents alone could fill an entire room. 
In fact, lawyers in the case have agreed to set up two identical "data rooms," one in Northern California and one in Southern California. 
So far, Ken Starr has stayed out of it all -- but now that he has so much time on his hands, who knows? 
 BATTER UP:The Andy Dolich, Joe Morgan and George Zimmer group looking to buy the Oakland A's has added some financial and marketing muscle to its prospective ownership team. 
Among the new marque players, whose names are being submitted to Major League Baseball as part of a possible bid: 
-- Robert Piccinini, chairman and majority shareholder of the Modesto-based Save Mart grocery chain, which operates 98 stores and boasts more than $1 billion in annual sales. 
-- Jeff Goodby, the San Francisco advertising ace who has given us such memorable TV moments as "Got Milk?", the Budweiser talking toads and the A's "Billy Ball" ads a few years back. 
Sources say Piccinini would probably be a major investor (in the $15 million to $20 million range) but not the only one -- other names may soon surface. 
By the way, April 21 is the drop- dead date for any potential bidders to step forward and meet the present owners $122 million asking price for the A's. If that does not happen, the owners have the option to move the team. 
 MR. JOE:We all know Joe DiMaggio was tough to approach for an autograph -- but here's a story about what happened when someone refused to sign one for him. 
It was back in 1994 when Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife were in town for a black-tie dinner at the Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park. 
An avid baseball fan, the emperor went out of his way to have both DiMaggio and Willie Mays invited. 
As former protocol chief Richard Goldman recalls, DiMaggio said "yes," even after being told that he would have to pay his own way here from Florida, where he was living in retirement. 
On the night of the dinner, DiMaggio showed up along with his granddaughter and a baseball he hoped the emperor would sign. 
Then DiMaggio learned that the emperor didn't sign anything. 
Unruffled, DiMaggio and Mays signed the ball themselves and presented it to the emperor. 
"The emperor cupped his hands, his eyes lit up, and he immediately took it over to the empress to show," Goldman recalled. "It was probably the most important gift he got on his whole tour of the United States."
