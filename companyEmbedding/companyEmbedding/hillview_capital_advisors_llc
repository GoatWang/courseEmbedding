The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The Man Who Hates E.T.F.s

        Posted
        on 06 Nov 2015

        in 
Resources 










After the Dow plunged over 1,000 points on the morning of August 24, 2015, the trading and liquidity of E.T.F.s came under the spotlight. E.T.F. discounts widened to as much as 30% for some funds that morning, as trading in E.T.F.s dried up during the plunge. Peter Kraus, chairman of AllianceBernstein, questions the safety of E.T.F.s in the New York Times article, “The Man Who Hates E.T.F.s.”

CEF Market Update: Wide Discounts Make for Attractive Opportunities

Bond Market Bloodbath Is in the Math

        Posted

News Resources 









 
In a recent Wall Street Journal article titled “Bond Market Bloodbath Is in the Math,” Richard Barley discusses the current state of the bond market and the extent to which duration can impact future fixed income returns.  After a very strong 2014 and January 2015, global interest rates have charged higher in recent weeks – particularly on the long end of the yield curve.  Since the short end of the yield curve in most countries remains anchored at very low levels, long rates moving higher has resulted in a steeper yield curve.  In terms of bond performance, this translates into relatively stable performance from short dated (or lower duration) fixed income and much more volatile (and recently negative) performance from long dated, long duration bonds.  For more on this topic, check out the article below.

Should Income Investors be Worried?

        Posted
        on 23 Apr 2015

        in 
News Resources 







 

 
Bloomberg recently ran a piece entitled, How ‘Safe’ Investments Could Destroy Your Portfolio, focusing on strategies investors have historically pursued for income that could lead them astray in the current market environment.  Broadly speaking, we agree with the sentiment here.  Due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s zero interest rate policy, investors have been pushed out the risk curve in order to meet their income requirements or total return expectations.  Thus, a normalization in Fed policy could prove problematic for certain “yield” assets such as dividend equities, high yield bonds, and other sorts of alternative income strategies.  We are attempting to mitigate these risks in our clients’ portfolios by shifting away from dividend equities and not taking on excess credit and/or interest rate risk in order to reach for yield .

2014 Year-End Tax Bulletin and Checklist

They say no news is good news, and in the case of 2014 this was accurate for American taxpayers. Without any significant legislative changes occurring throughout the year or predicted entering 2015, traditional estate and tax planning techniques for a low-interest rate environment prevailed. In the mid-term elections, we saw a major shift in GOP power with the Republican Party taking control of the Senate by picking up six seats from the Democrats, in addition to strengthening their grip on the House of Representatives. In 2015, we can expect to see:Read More…    


















Validating the Tax Status of Grantees

Foundation Source advises that “Private foundations must validate the exempt status of a nonprofit before making a grant and must do so each and every time, even if granting to the same organization. If a foundation grants to an organization that has not maintained its status as an IRS designated public charity, it could result in significant tax penalties…”
If you have a private foundation or plan to establish one, the following article may be helpful in providing an overview of the compliance issues around validation. To read more, click here: Foundation Source – Validating Tax Status ADV – July 2014

We work within a disciplined process to conceive, create and manage customized wealth management solutions that endeavor to protect our clients’ assets and grow their wealth in  everchanging markets. We seek investment opportunities outside of consensus, are not afraid to move ahead of the crowd and will allocate capital in a manner that we believe best exploits these opportunities while managing our requirements for transparency and liquidity.


Our extensive knowledge and experience has enabled us to consistently identify opportunities with prospects for superior returns, with limited and quantifiable risk to capital. In many cases, these opportunities were not obvious or popular at the time, but our in-depth research and courage of our convictions led us to recommend investments that served our clients well.
Hillview’s client-centric approach – what we believe to be the only way a client can be best served – contrasts greatly with the conventional product-centric management model that exists at other wealth management firms. We believe that only by creating an environment where  experience and knowledge are leveraged without artificial constraints, and are appropriately supported by dedicated resources, can we achieve superior results for our clients.










 2Research Process 


Our investment team employs a multi-disciplinary approach in its decision-making process. We analyze a broad range of asset classes and  strategies, and develop forward looking projections of risk and return across a number of potential scenarios. Those which appear most attractive and positively asymmetric direct our manager research activity, where we develop and refine a thesis for investment in the asset class, and determine the most effective form of implementation.
Alternatives from simple, liquid passive forms of exposure to more active and, potentially, less liquid ones are evaluated to identify the most  optimal approach, given the thesis. Manager selection draws upon the team’s long history and experience, and is complemented by comprehensive operational due diligence in conjunction with the firm’s Chief  Compliance Officer.
Once selected, asset classes are combined into client portfolios based on potential risks and returns, liquidity, and sensitivity to various factors. Portfolios are constructed to minimize the chance of permanent impairment of capital, and to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns  throughout market cycles. This process is repeated on an ongoing basis, and changes made to portfolios as expectations for risk and reward  change due to fundamentals, valuations, and external factors.


Hillview’s Investment Committee is the body responsible for setting portfolio allocations as wells as the hiring and firing of investment  managers, and is comprised of the firm’s senior investment  professionals and executives. Prior to hiring, we subject  investment managers to thorough due diligence and compliance reviews on a quarterly basis. Managers found in deficit of our expectations are subject to review and termination.
The investment culture at Hillview is founded on entrepreneurial thinking and devoid of traditional institutional constraints.  Our experience is that the best investment opportunities often reside outside of the consensus. We have a history of identifying and recommending less well known asset classes and strategies – not on the menus of institutional investors – which offered  attractive returns and opportunities for added value.
Over time, our investment process has nurtured a conviction in our investment decisions – one that has led to successful  partnerships with the individuals, families, and institutions we have had the privilege to serve.










 3Risk Management 


Our primary objective is to avoid permanent impairment of capital. We employ proprietary tools to estimate, measure, and manage risk across portfolios. These tools were developed by our investment team in order to specifically address the unique challenges of managing multi-asset portfolios. Similarly, portfolios are constructed with the unique constraints and objectives of each client in mind.


Our commitment is to maintain a strong compliance culture because we understand that risk management extends beyond just the investment portfolio. Our Policy and Operating Committee – consisting of senior members from the Investment team, Client Service, Operations, Technology and Compliance areas – meets monthly to discuss issues that may impact our clients and our business. With members from every department working together, we have created a flexible, streamlined and open system of internal communication that undeniably leads to better results for our clients.










 4Client Service & Report 


From its beginnings, Hillview employed a business model rooted in client-centricity – it is embedded deep within the every fabric of our firm’s governance, management practices and compensation structures.
The firm’s high employee-to-client ratio helps to provide a dedicated, diligent service team for each of our clients. Each team is led by one of the firm’s partners, and includes a financial planning associate who handles day-to-day responsibilities and tasks resulting from client interactions, and a portfolio administrator responsible for all operational functions. Service includes timely, systematic client communication and informative meetings throughout the year.


We are leaders in the efficient use technology – leveraging it to enhance the client experience, increase the value of our service, and deepen our relationships. The Hillview Client Portal offers a performance-reporting platform that aggregates information on all of a client’s investments, providing portfolio-wide visibility, regardless of where assets are held. Our clients get a comprehensive view of their assets, while we analyze and monitor all of their investments – enabling us to make better-informed recommendations and advise them in a holistic manner.
The portal is password protected and available 24/7, providing a reliable and insightful tool for our clients to view their investments. Information on all liquid investments is available on a dailybasis, and less liquid investments on a monthly/quarterly basis. Clients may also store important documents and personal information in their Document Vault. In times of emergency, they can count on knowing there is one secure location to access all the information they need.

Our primary objective is to ensure each client’s charitable activity has the desired impact on the causes that interest them the most, but more importantly, that in the end our clients have a means to achieve their philanthropic aspirations.

Case studies 




Family Foundation vs. Donor Advised Fund




Estate Planning




Socially Responsible Investment Portfolio








A second-generation member of a wealthy family stewarded her family’s private foundation which served as their primary giving vehicle for over a decade. The family began to realize that the foundation’s management and administrative costs were an increasing burden and wanted to explore alternative options.  Hillview conducted a detailed cost/benefit comparison of the private foundation and donor-advised fund models.


This assessment took into account the overall management requirements, administrative expenses, and payout requirements associated with each option.  We also confirmed that each option would provide sufficient flexibility in how she executed the family’s giving strategies. After extensive consultation with family members Hillview recommended that they establish a donor advised fund as a highly cost-effective solution requiring minimal changes to the family’s philanthropic aspirations.








Prompted by a client’s request to comment on his and his wife’s life insurance, Hillview assessed the policies’ role with respect to the family’s income replacement needs and wealth transfer objectives.  In the course of our consultation, Hillview found that the client was “over-insured” and that his wife’s policy was both costly and misaligned with the family’s needs.  More importantly, we uncovered several material shortcomings with the family’s estate plans.  These red flags indicated the need for a comprehensive and coordinated estate planning assessment and design.  Hillview assumed the role of quarterbacking a team-oriented approach involving the client’s life insurance professional, T&E attorney, and accountant.


The outcome of our work was: 1) an updated estate plan aligned with the client’s wealth preservation and transfer goals; 2) establishment of revocable trusts to avoid probate and to maintain family’s privacy; 3) replacement of existing life insurance with more suitable policies that had preferential pricing and flexible terms; 4) increased and segregated funding for the children’s educational expenses. The most significant outcome, however, was our client’s expressed “peace of mind” that his wealth will transfer, upon his passing, in a manner that provides for long-term financial security for his family.








Our client was interested in aligning her investments with her values and asked us for guidance. She completed a survey to establish socially responsible investment (SRI) screens. After several consultations, a prototype portfolio was designed using both positive and negative screening methodologies, while targeting a risk/return profile aligned with her custom benchmark. The prototype SRI portfolio was benchmarked against a custom global benchmark – 80% S&P 500 Index + 20% S&P ADR Index.


The recommended portfolio excluded oil, gas and coal companies that are major suppliers of fossil fuels and companies that facilitate the production and transportation of fossil fuels. Major chemical companies, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and nuclear power generators were among the exclusions beyond the fossil fuel universe. The portfolio also favored companies that receive high scores in an environmental, social and governance ranking system, with emphasis placed on companies that contribute to improving the sustainability of the global economy.
