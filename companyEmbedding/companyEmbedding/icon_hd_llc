Behind Our Products — ICON HDT 





























































Behind Our Products

Meet the brilliant minds behind our automatic tire inflation technology. 






ICON HDT brought together a team of innovators experienced in fields such as Automotive Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Bio-agricultural Engineering, Business, and even Psychology to design, research, and develop state of the art Automatic Tire Inflation Systems (ATIS) for both heavy duty tractors and trailers.The products developed by ICON Heavy Duty Technologies address driver security which significantly increases driver retention. This technology impacts the entire transportation industry. ICON HDT automatic tire inflation systems increase profit margins, ensures less debris on roadways, and lowers emissions creating a safer environment. 







Tony Ingram, a member of American Trucking Associations, The Maintenance Counsel, and Society of Automotive Engineers, has been instrumental throughout the history of automatic tire inflation technology. He introduced ATIS to the U.S. transportation industry in the early 1990’s. Tony's extensive background in automotive engineering and his degree in marketing gave him the unique skills to tackle this project. He is an expert in the field and continues to evolve ATIS technology in response to increased government regulations.  







 Dr. Marvin Stone from Oklahoma State University was part of ICON’s interdisciplinary team. His wisdom and input were invaluable.  During his life he was involved in the research and development of the Oklahoma Mesonet, a world-class network of 120 automated environmental monitoring stations situated in all 77 counties in Oklahoma. Weather forecasters in Oklahoma and the National Weather service still depend on this web of information to accurately forecast the weather. He was also a member of the research team that created Greenseeker ® Technology. They were the first to measure crop needs in real time reducing waste while improving agricultural yields. This technology changed the face of the entire agricultural industry. Dr. Stone’s knowledge of biosensor systems and environmental issues fueled his passion for ICON HDT’s project and gave him unique insight into how measurements could affect great change. He immediately recognized the potential of Tony’s technology to address greater issues such as climate change and fuel consumption and was happy to participate in this world-changing technology. Tragically, Dr. Stone died in the incident at the OSU Homecoming in 2015 so he did not live to see the technology he loved come to fruition, however, he changed the world with his knowledge and willingness to share it for the good of the whole. Dr. Stone was instrumental in using biosensors in agriculture and meteorology so it is only fitting that the culmination of his experience in measurement would be use sensors and significantly impact the transportation industry, fuel consumption, climate change, and safety. Dr. Stone’s mentorship was invaluable to the success of ICON HDT.Tony led the first team that introduced over-the-road Automatic Tire Inflation to the trucking industry in 1993 and has patented and marketed over 15 designs. Tony founded ICON HDT to remain on the cutting edge of the evolving role of ATIS in trucking. We only succeed by standing on the shoulders of giants. ICON HDT’s passion for the positive affect Automatic Tire Inflation has on safety, fuel savings and carbon footprint drives our pioneering team to continue innovating. ICON HDT is dedicated to good stewardship of the transportation industry. We provide a reliable, affordable solution to common safety and regulatory issues that increase highway safety, protect drivers, lower the cost of transportation, and increase fleet profit margins.
