Factors that Influence Car Insurance Rates
If you're shopping for insurance for your car, truck, or RV, you may already know that coverage options, deductibles, and discounts play a major role in the size of your premiums.
Why can insurance premiums go up?
There are several other factors used to determine how much you pay for auto insurance. For example, changes in your driving record, marital status, your age, and/or moving to a different neighborhood can cause you to pay more for car insurance.

How You Drive
 


Driving History
There are plenty of reasons to drive safely, but saving money is an especially good one. If you've had speeding tickets or accidents within the last few years, your auto insurance rate will be higher than if you had a spotless driving record. Safe driving pays off – in more ways than one!

Driving Activity
A policyholder who drives only a few miles a week will likely pay less for auto insurance than one who drives longer distances.
 


Your Vehicle
 


Safety Rating
Some vehicles are safer and cost less to repair than others. Insurance companies collect data about each make and model and use it to determine how much to charge its customers.

Vehicle Size
In an accident, larger vehicles tend to fare better – and keep occupants safer – than smaller ones.

Anti-Theft Devices
If your car has an alarm, a tracking device to help police recover it, or another theft deterrent, it's less attractive to thieves, and less expensive to insure, too.
 


Who You Are
 


Where You Live
If you live in an area with above average traffic, your auto insurance rate could be higher than if you lived in an area with less traffic congestion.

Age, Gender and Marital Status
Drivers between the ages of 25 and 65 tend to have fewer accidents than those who are younger or older. In addition, studies show that certain individuals have fewer accidents.

Credit History
Studies show a connection between credit characteristics and insurance claims, so many insurance companies use "Credit-Based Insurance Scores" to help determine rates (not applicable where prohibited by law).
 


Your Policy Choices
 


Coverage Options
Some insurance – like Liability Coverage – is required by law in most states. The rest is up to you. Your insurance choices and coverage amounts have a major impact on how much you'll pay.

Deductibles
A deductible is the amount you pay before your insurance company covers you. You can lower your auto insurance rates by setting a higher deductible, but you'll pay more out-of-pocket when you make a claim.

Discounts
State Farm™ offers many discounts to help you save money on auto insurance. Get an auto insurance quote or find a State Farm agent to discuss which discounts you might be eligible for.
 


Discounts
 


Drive Safe & Save™
Enroll in Drive Safe & Save and we'll use information from your smartphone or your vehicle's OnStar® or SYNC® communication service to calculate your discount. Safe drivers save more with Drive Safe & Save.

Steer Clear®
If you're a new driver or under 25 years of age without any at-fault accidents or moving violations within the past three years, you could qualify for Steer Clear. You could save as much as 15% while learning to become a better, safer driver.

Multiple Line Discount
Save up to 17% if you have homeowners, renters, condo, or life insurance in addition to vehicle insurance. Speak with a State Farm agent to see if you're eligible or to learn about additional cost-saving discounts.
 


Accident-Free Discount
You qualify for this accident-free discount when your car, or the one it replaced, has been insured by State Farm for at least 3 continuous years without a chargeable accident.

Multiple Auto Discount
If two or more vehicles in your household are insurance by State Farm and owned by related individuals, you could save as much as 20%.

Good Student Discount
You can save up to 25% just for getting good grades! And the savings last after you graduate from college, until you turn 25.

What is an SR-22? | EverQuote.com



























What Is an SR-22 Form?









Posted Jul 16, 2015 by Ashley Kane






You likely haven’t heard of an SR-22. Perhaps you’ve heard of an acquaintance needing one or are concerned you might need one yourself. Few people know the filing exists and in general, it’s better that way. An SR-22 is usually required after a run-in or violation with the law. If you’re a safe driver and avoided those, you probably haven’t come into contact with the form. However, if you’re interested in learning more just in case or in need of some guidance about next steps to take, read on.

What Is an SR-22?
Despite what people often think, an SR-22 is not car insurance. An SR-22 is simply a document filing that verifies someone has auto insurance. Its name stands for several variations of “safety responsibility”, “state reference form”, and “state requirement” form. Sometimes, you might also hear the filing referred to as a “certificate of financial responsibility.”
The SR-22 form is filed by your insurance carrier and then passed onto your state’s DMV. It confirms that you meet the car insurance liability requirements of your state. The state typically mandates the need for the certificate, and then an individual must contact their car insurance company for next steps.
Every state has different car insurance requirements resulting in many different types of SR-22 forms. They don’t all hold the same coverage laws. Basically, the form is evidence of responsibility so that the DMV knows you are a covered driver in case of future accidents. In nearly all states it’s the law to have some degree of coverage.  
 
Who Needs an SR-22?
There are several possible reasons your state may mandate you to file an SR-22.

DUI

If you’ve been convicted of a DUI or DWI, you will likely need an SR-22. Driving under the influence is a serious crime and states want to make sure you are properly covered before getting on the road again.

Driving Without Any Insurance

If you were caught driving without car insurance, you will need an SR-22 filing. The reason is relatively obvious, as your state will likely want proof of your insurance if you’ve been found without it.

Multiple Violations

If you have multiple violations, such as repeated tickets for speeding or reckless driving, then your state may be apprehensive and see you as a risky motorist. As a result, they may require the form to confirm your coverage.

Suspended License

If you have had your driver’s license suspended or revoked, your state may require proof of car insurance in order for it to be reinstated.
 
Consequences of an SR-22:
Finding out you need to carry an SR-22 isn’t the best news. Car insurance carriers typically require a small fee, anywhere from $15-$50, to file the SR-22 form, but the consequences are larger. You will likely face higher premiums for some time as needing an SR-22 is often seen as an indicator of risk for insurance companies. High-risk drivers typically feel the burden of any violations for an indeterminate amount of time. If you’re unhappy with your premium, you can always try shopping around. Though you will still have to inform a new carrier about recent violations, they may still offer a more affordable rate. Furthermore, not all auto insurers will provide an SR-22 form so check to make sure your provider can fulfill the requirements. Most of the larger names are well aware of the SR-22 requirements and will assist you with the process.
The silver lining in all of this is that if you follow the filing rules, your state will mandate the form for approximately 3-5 years. After that, your premium rate will drop again. If you do your best to drive safe, you can recover from an SR-22 filing.
Furthermore, not all states have an SR-22 requirement. If you live in Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, or Pennsylvania, you do not need to worry about an SR-22. However, if you’ve recently moved, your old state of residence may still require the filing. You can speak to your local DMV to find out what is required for you to be driving on the roads.
Even if you don’t own a vehicle, you still may be required to file an SR-22 if you have had serious driving violations. Usually, a driver will have to purchase non-owner car insurance and the carrier will file an SR-22 in a similar manner.
SR-22s can be a hassle to deal with but we promise you that they aren’t forever. If you focus on maintaining a safe driving record and carefully follow the filing procedures, you’ll be free of the requirement in no time.

Auto Insurance Tips






Have Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
This coverage covers you and family members that live with you for injuries caused by a negligent driver that fails to maintain enough (or any) auto liability coverage.  This is not a mandatory coverage in most states and is easy to overlook when price shopping. If you choose, for example, Bodily Injury Liability of $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident, you should mirror these limits with the Uninsured/Under-insured Motorist Liability on your policy.

Maintain Good Credit
Many insurance companies take your credit score (sometimes referred to as an insurance score) into account when they develop your auto insurance premium. Insurance companies have found that clients with poor credit scores are more likely to have and submit a claim against their policy.
Increase Your Deductible to Save Money
One way to reduce your annual premium is by increasing your collision and/or comprehensive deductible.  The more you are willing to self-insure before the insurance company pays a claim, the lower your premium.  Average deductibles start at $250 or $500, but increasing your deductible to $1,000 or $2,000 could save you hundreds in premium each year. Just be sure that you can afford the higher deductible in case you’re involved in an accident.
Consider Your Billing Plan
Insurance companies often provide multiple bill plan options: monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual are the most common.  Installment fees average from $5 to $10 a month per installment. This means that if you pay monthly premiums with a $5 installment fee each month, you are charged an extra $60 a year. Instead, ask for automatic deductions, more commonly known as EFT payments. Monthly installments are automatically withdrawn from your checking account, which can eliminate fees. Many carriers also offer a pay-in-full discount for annual payment plans, so take advantage of extra savings when possible.

Stay out of trouble by following these auto insurance tips

Consider Driving Habits that Drive Up Insurance Rates
Your car insurance premium is a reflection of how you behave as a driver.  Some factors that impact your insurance premium are:

Moving violations. Moving violations like speeding tickets, stop sign violations, and accidents that are your fault typically create surcharges in your annual premium.
Higher mileage. Since the chance of incident increases the more you drive, higher mileage per year usually means higher premiums.  If you are a light driver, look into a low-mileage discount. 
Having a newer vehicle. Newer vehicles typically cost more to insure than older models. If you’re considering a new car, ask your agent or insurance representative for an insurance estimate to avoid a surprise hike in your premium.

Remember: Not All Auto Insurance Companies are the Same

When deciding between insurance companies, know what’s most important to you.  Will you want OEM (Original Equipment Manufactured) parts on your vehicle’s repairs or are you satisfied with aftermarket parts?
Most carriers provide actual cash value settlement. This means that the insurance company will look up the market value of your vehicle based on its mileage, condition, and amenities. Some carriers offer the option for agreed value settlement: you and the company “agree” to a value at policy inception, and this is the value you receive if your car is totaled.
Consider the financial stability of the insurance company you’re choosing.  Choose an insurance company with an “A” financial rating or better. This rating is a reflection of a carrier’s financial stability, customer service, claims satisfaction, and overall performance in the insurance marketplace.

Consider Accident Forgiveness Coverage
More insurance carriers now carry accident forgiveness coverage.  You pay more in premium to have this coverage on your auto policy, but it prevents your carrier from increasing your insurance rates following your first at-fault accident.
Don’t Let Your Policy Lapse
Your insurance coverage history can impact the quotes you receive from new insurance companies.  Maintain continuous insurance coverage and avoid a lapse so that your new company will perceive you as financially responsible and less risky than someone who lets their coverage cancel or lapse.
Remove Unnecessary Coverage
Get an analysis of your vehicle’s value and condition, as well as your own financial situation.  As your vehicle ages, you receive less reimbursement after a claim for damage to your car. It may make sense to remove comprehensive and collision coverage in order to drop your premium. Websites like Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds.com can help you determine the current value of your car.
Special Circumstances:
Do I Need Collector’s Car Insurance?
People who own antique, vintage, classic, or exotic cars should more carefully consider insurance companies.  Some companies specialize in insuring older cars with increased value due to restorations done to the vehicle over the years.  Using specialty carriers is often necessary to insure cars with values higher than $100,000. Insurance rates for these types of vehicles can be lower than average car insurance costs because these vehicles are often only used a few months of the year and have very limited mileage.
Am I Covered When I Rent a Car?
Renting a car when you go on vacation is common.  If you have a personal auto policy, your own insurance coverage extends to the temporary vehicle as though it were your own. Your liability protects you against injuries or damages that you’re responsible for while using the rental car, however; rental agencies will ask if you want to purchase what is commonly known as a collision damage waiver. There is typically a daily charge for this waiver ($10-$20 depending on the rental agency). If you chose to purchase the waiver, any damage you cause to the rental vehicle will be covered by the rental agency themselves at no additional charge to you. One type of coverage your policy likely won’t provide is loss of use. If you’re responsible for the damage to the rental vehicle and it requires repairs, the rental agency could charge you for the loss of use, or their inability to rent that vehicle, while the car is fixed.
Have Rental Reimbursement Coverage
Also known as substitute transportation, this coverage is essential if you want to avoid large out-of-pocket costs for a rental car should your car be involved in an accident. Cost of this coverage will vary since carriers allow you to choose a dollar limit ($15, $20, $30 or more per day).  Because it is fairly inexpensive, this coverage can pay off the first time you have to use it.
How Do I Insure a Leased Vehicle or a Vehicle with a Loan?
If you’re in a lease or considering a leased vehicle, remember that the lease contract will require you to carry a specific minimum coverage on your auto insurance. Most require that you maintain Bodily Injury Liability and Uninsured/Under-insured Liability of $100,000/$300,000. Lease vehicles also limit the maximum deductible on your policy: often $1,000 is the maximum allowed deductible.  If you take out a loan on a newly purchased car, you won’t have any specific requirements for liability coverage.  Though you can choose your own liability limits, you will need to have comprehensive and collision insurance as a requirement of the loan. GAP coverage, also known as Loan/Lease coverage, provides reimbursement when a total loss occurs to a vehicle and the amount you get from the insurance company is less than the amount you own on the loan. GAP coverage pays the difference between the totaled value and loan amount.  If you put a large amount of cash down on a new purchase or if you use your trade in value to gain equity on your new car, you might be able to go without GAP coverage. Since interest rates are low, many auto dealers offer sign-and-drive,  $0 down, or deferred payment deals on new car purchases. It’s very important to have GAP coverage in these situations, as the depreciation of a new vehicle in the first year often drops the vehicle’s value faster than you can pay down your loan.
Take a Safety Driving Course
If you’re looking to lower your auto insurance premium, you might consider enrolling in a safety driving course. There’s a range of options to choose from, including driver’s education and defensive driving. Car insurers love to see that their customers care about driving safe and the completion of one of these courses typically results in a premium discount. These courses vary in price, starting around $50 with rates discounted 10-15%.
Shop Regularly
The most important piece of information to know when it comes to car insurance is that you must shop around. Browse, research, compare quotes, and shop regularly. Check out other car insurance carriers even if your policy isn’t up yet. You never know what one provider will offer you in comparison. Shopping around is also the best tactic to beat price optimization. Some car insurers are using data to determine which customers are least likely to switch carriers, and are then raising their rates because of that. Because pricing intelligence is relatively new, few legalities exist. For now, shopping for quotes regularly is the best way to insure you are getting quality car insurance at the price you deserve.
Consider Before You Buy
When purchasing or leasing a new or used vehicle, you might want to first consider your car insurance premium. Many factors determine car insurance rates; primarily driving history and location, but car make and model can also influence the price. Depending on whether a car is old or new, has few or many safety features, and has high or cheap replacement costs can all determine your premium rate. Typically, more expensive cars cost more to insure. Consider your options by comparing quotes before purchasing a car.
Safeguard Your Vehicle
One way to save money on your auto insurance is to upgrade your safety features. Your vehicle likely has several safeguards already including airbags and quality seatbelts. Upgrading to an automatic braking system or other collision avoidance system can keep you safe and save you money. Anti-theft devices work the same way and even obtaining VIN etchings can come with a discount. When speaking with an agent, be sure to mention all of your vehicle’s extra features.
Ask and Ask Again
Ask a lot of questions. To get the best deal on auto insurance, you need to. If you’re confused about your policy details or what type of coverage is available to you, speak up. It also never hurts to ask about potential discounts and to let your agent know whenever anything concerning your driving situation changes.
Bundle Up On Insurance
Bundling up on insurance policies can sometimes save you money. If you need home or life insurance, consider buying them from the same company as your auto insurance. Providers will typically offer a discount known as a “bundle discount” or “multi-policy discount” to customers who are purchasing more than one form of insurance. Savings can be up to 25%.

 I was there...


Tell us your story >


I was with Motors Insurance Corporation (MIC), the Insurance People from General Motors. We were formed in 1925 to provide physical damage coverage for General Motors vehicles sold by dealers and financed by General Motors Acceptance Corp. (GMAC).  Our overall mission was to help dealers sell GM cars and trucks and earning a profit was somewhat secondary. I was hired in 1961 in Denver and transferred to Little Rock before I reported for work. 
General Motors dealers were our only agents and they sold our products on new and used vehicles in order to deliver the vehicle and to earn a commission. Our field adjusters handled the claims when accidents were reported, also through the dealers. Adjusters were keypointed throughout each branch and were responsible for service in their territories. These adjusters had the responsiblilty and the AUTHORITY to handle every situation in their areas and they worked long and hard to give SERVICE SECOND TO NONE. The only people I have known who were as dedicated to their jobs and as determined to look after GM business were the United States Marines with whom I served in the early fifties in Korea.
MIC was the first insurance company to offer comprehensive insurance coverage on a mass basic. In 1973-74, MIC developed and introduced mechanical coverages for new vehicles and for certain certified used vehicles. MIC developed the first GENERAL MOTORS CONTINUOUS PROTECTION PLAN, later shortened to GENERAL MOTORS PROTECTION PLAN for new vehicles. At one time MIC insured most of the dealer inventory and was famous for the speedy and organized handling of catastrophe losses around the country. Many retired field personnel still gather and handle hail, flood and other types of catastrophe losses at General Motors dealerships.
MIC Special Agents, later titled Agency Relations Supervisors, assisted dealers in analyzing their finance and insurance operations in order to maxamize profits. As Finance and Insurance profits became more essential to the overall profit picture, MIC personnel assisted dealers in establishing and managing their finance and insurance departments.
MIC also provided feedback to the divisions by completing Product Information Reports and Collision Performance Injury Reports on certain current models. A number of product changes/improvements were the result of these reports.
I retired from Detroit in 1992 and for the last four years was the sales liaison between MIC and GMAC as GMAC absorbed many of MIC's duties. What used to be MIC is now known as GMAC Insurance.

Motor Insurance FAQ








Home > Products > Motor Insurance FAQ 






Know more about BPI/Ms’ Superior Motor Insurance Protection
What is BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor Insurance?
The BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor Insurance comes with an extensive coverage to protect your vehicle from Accidental Collision and Theft, as well as protection from damages caused by Fire, Explosion, Lightning and Self-Ignition and Malicious Damage
While I was driving my car, I accidentally hit a pedestrian. Is liability to other persons covered by BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor Insurance?
Yes! BPI/MS offers two types of coverage to protect from liabilities for injuries caused to other persons:
Compulsory Third Party Liability (CTPL) – This is the basic insurance coverage required by the Land Transportation Office when you register your vehicle. This coverage will answer for the death, disablement and medical expenses of a person injured because of an accident involving your vehicle.
Voluntary Third Party Liability-Bodily Injury (VTPL-BI) – This serves as an additional coverage on top of your basic CTPL, since this will answer for expenses in excess of CTPL’s coverage limit. This is a standard feature of all BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor policies.
What if my vehicle causes damage to another person’s property? Do I have coverage for this?
Don’t worry! BPI/MS offers Voluntary Third Party Liability-Property Damage (VTPL-PD) that provides you with protection in case your vehicle damages other people’s properties. This coverage is also standard to all BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor policies.
Are my vehicle’s passengers covered if they get hurt due to an accident?
Yes! BPI/MS’ Unnamed Passenger Personal Accident (UPPA) is an insurance coverage that will answer for the death, disablement and medical expenses for the driver and passengers of your vehicle in the unfortunate event of an accident. UPPA is optional at a very affordable cost that you may add to your BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor policy.
Do you also cover damages due to Flood, Typhoon or other similar events?
Yes! Natural calamities are inevitable and could cause serious damage to your vehicle. For your added protection, you may request for an additional coverage against Flood, Typhoon, Hurricane, Volcanic Eruption, Earthquake, Strike, Riot and Civil Commotion subject to payment of an additional premium.
Are the car accessories covered?
Yes! BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor Insurance covers all accessories that are standard to your vehicle’s type or unit. If you add any other accessories, please inform us so that we can make arrangements to insure them.
Is towing covered under the BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor Insurance?
Yes! Because BPI/MS Comprehensive Motor Insurance now offers FREE Express Roadside Assistance (ERA) that provides you with emergency assistance on the road, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to qualified policy holders.
What shall I do if I need to file a claim?
It’s so easy! Just call the BPI/MS Claims Department or any of the BPI/MS branch offices near you and submit your complete claims documents. For your convenience, a BPI/MS Motor Claims Guide will be provided upon issuance of your motor policy. The motor claims guide includes all the necessary information that you need to know in filling your claim.

What is an SR-22? | EverQuote.com



























What Is an SR-22 Form?









Posted Jul 16, 2015 by Ashley Kane






You likely haven’t heard of an SR-22. Perhaps you’ve heard of an acquaintance needing one or are concerned you might need one yourself. Few people know the filing exists and in general, it’s better that way. An SR-22 is usually required after a run-in or violation with the law. If you’re a safe driver and avoided those, you probably haven’t come into contact with the form. However, if you’re interested in learning more just in case or in need of some guidance about next steps to take, read on.

What Is an SR-22?
Despite what people often think, an SR-22 is not car insurance. An SR-22 is simply a document filing that verifies someone has auto insurance. Its name stands for several variations of “safety responsibility”, “state reference form”, and “state requirement” form. Sometimes, you might also hear the filing referred to as a “certificate of financial responsibility.”
The SR-22 form is filed by your insurance carrier and then passed onto your state’s DMV. It confirms that you meet the car insurance liability requirements of your state. The state typically mandates the need for the certificate, and then an individual must contact their car insurance company for next steps.
Every state has different car insurance requirements resulting in many different types of SR-22 forms. They don’t all hold the same coverage laws. Basically, the form is evidence of responsibility so that the DMV knows you are a covered driver in case of future accidents. In nearly all states it’s the law to have some degree of coverage.  
 
Who Needs an SR-22?
There are several possible reasons your state may mandate you to file an SR-22.

DUI

If you’ve been convicted of a DUI or DWI, you will likely need an SR-22. Driving under the influence is a serious crime and states want to make sure you are properly covered before getting on the road again.

Driving Without Any Insurance

If you were caught driving without car insurance, you will need an SR-22 filing. The reason is relatively obvious, as your state will likely want proof of your insurance if you’ve been found without it.

Multiple Violations

If you have multiple violations, such as repeated tickets for speeding or reckless driving, then your state may be apprehensive and see you as a risky motorist. As a result, they may require the form to confirm your coverage.

Suspended License

If you have had your driver’s license suspended or revoked, your state may require proof of car insurance in order for it to be reinstated.
 
Consequences of an SR-22:
Finding out you need to carry an SR-22 isn’t the best news. Car insurance carriers typically require a small fee, anywhere from $15-$50, to file the SR-22 form, but the consequences are larger. You will likely face higher premiums for some time as needing an SR-22 is often seen as an indicator of risk for insurance companies. High-risk drivers typically feel the burden of any violations for an indeterminate amount of time. If you’re unhappy with your premium, you can always try shopping around. Though you will still have to inform a new carrier about recent violations, they may still offer a more affordable rate. Furthermore, not all auto insurers will provide an SR-22 form so check to make sure your provider can fulfill the requirements. Most of the larger names are well aware of the SR-22 requirements and will assist you with the process.
The silver lining in all of this is that if you follow the filing rules, your state will mandate the form for approximately 3-5 years. After that, your premium rate will drop again. If you do your best to drive safe, you can recover from an SR-22 filing.
Furthermore, not all states have an SR-22 requirement. If you live in Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, or Pennsylvania, you do not need to worry about an SR-22. However, if you’ve recently moved, your old state of residence may still require the filing. You can speak to your local DMV to find out what is required for you to be driving on the roads.
Even if you don’t own a vehicle, you still may be required to file an SR-22 if you have had serious driving violations. Usually, a driver will have to purchase non-owner car insurance and the carrier will file an SR-22 in a similar manner.
SR-22s can be a hassle to deal with but we promise you that they aren’t forever. If you focus on maintaining a safe driving record and carefully follow the filing procedures, you’ll be free of the requirement in no time.

Auto Insurance Tips






Have Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
This coverage covers you and family members that live with you for injuries caused by a negligent driver that fails to maintain enough (or any) auto liability coverage.  This is not a mandatory coverage in most states and is easy to overlook when price shopping. If you choose, for example, Bodily Injury Liability of $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident, you should mirror these limits with the Uninsured/Under-insured Motorist Liability on your policy.

Maintain Good Credit
Many insurance companies take your credit score (sometimes referred to as an insurance score) into account when they develop your auto insurance premium. Insurance companies have found that clients with poor credit scores are more likely to have and submit a claim against their policy.
Increase Your Deductible to Save Money
One way to reduce your annual premium is by increasing your collision and/or comprehensive deductible.  The more you are willing to self-insure before the insurance company pays a claim, the lower your premium.  Average deductibles start at $250 or $500, but increasing your deductible to $1,000 or $2,000 could save you hundreds in premium each year. Just be sure that you can afford the higher deductible in case you’re involved in an accident.
Consider Your Billing Plan
Insurance companies often provide multiple bill plan options: monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual are the most common.  Installment fees average from $5 to $10 a month per installment. This means that if you pay monthly premiums with a $5 installment fee each month, you are charged an extra $60 a year. Instead, ask for automatic deductions, more commonly known as EFT payments. Monthly installments are automatically withdrawn from your checking account, which can eliminate fees. Many carriers also offer a pay-in-full discount for annual payment plans, so take advantage of extra savings when possible.

Stay out of trouble by following these auto insurance tips

Consider Driving Habits that Drive Up Insurance Rates
Your car insurance premium is a reflection of how you behave as a driver.  Some factors that impact your insurance premium are:

Moving violations. Moving violations like speeding tickets, stop sign violations, and accidents that are your fault typically create surcharges in your annual premium.
Higher mileage. Since the chance of incident increases the more you drive, higher mileage per year usually means higher premiums.  If you are a light driver, look into a low-mileage discount. 
Having a newer vehicle. Newer vehicles typically cost more to insure than older models. If you’re considering a new car, ask your agent or insurance representative for an insurance estimate to avoid a surprise hike in your premium.

Remember: Not All Auto Insurance Companies are the Same

When deciding between insurance companies, know what’s most important to you.  Will you want OEM (Original Equipment Manufactured) parts on your vehicle’s repairs or are you satisfied with aftermarket parts?
Most carriers provide actual cash value settlement. This means that the insurance company will look up the market value of your vehicle based on its mileage, condition, and amenities. Some carriers offer the option for agreed value settlement: you and the company “agree” to a value at policy inception, and this is the value you receive if your car is totaled.
Consider the financial stability of the insurance company you’re choosing.  Choose an insurance company with an “A” financial rating or better. This rating is a reflection of a carrier’s financial stability, customer service, claims satisfaction, and overall performance in the insurance marketplace.

Consider Accident Forgiveness Coverage
More insurance carriers now carry accident forgiveness coverage.  You pay more in premium to have this coverage on your auto policy, but it prevents your carrier from increasing your insurance rates following your first at-fault accident.
Don’t Let Your Policy Lapse
Your insurance coverage history can impact the quotes you receive from new insurance companies.  Maintain continuous insurance coverage and avoid a lapse so that your new company will perceive you as financially responsible and less risky than someone who lets their coverage cancel or lapse.
Remove Unnecessary Coverage
Get an analysis of your vehicle’s value and condition, as well as your own financial situation.  As your vehicle ages, you receive less reimbursement after a claim for damage to your car. It may make sense to remove comprehensive and collision coverage in order to drop your premium. Websites like Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds.com can help you determine the current value of your car.
Special Circumstances:
Do I Need Collector’s Car Insurance?
People who own antique, vintage, classic, or exotic cars should more carefully consider insurance companies.  Some companies specialize in insuring older cars with increased value due to restorations done to the vehicle over the years.  Using specialty carriers is often necessary to insure cars with values higher than $100,000. Insurance rates for these types of vehicles can be lower than average car insurance costs because these vehicles are often only used a few months of the year and have very limited mileage.
Am I Covered When I Rent a Car?
Renting a car when you go on vacation is common.  If you have a personal auto policy, your own insurance coverage extends to the temporary vehicle as though it were your own. Your liability protects you against injuries or damages that you’re responsible for while using the rental car, however; rental agencies will ask if you want to purchase what is commonly known as a collision damage waiver. There is typically a daily charge for this waiver ($10-$20 depending on the rental agency). If you chose to purchase the waiver, any damage you cause to the rental vehicle will be covered by the rental agency themselves at no additional charge to you. One type of coverage your policy likely won’t provide is loss of use. If you’re responsible for the damage to the rental vehicle and it requires repairs, the rental agency could charge you for the loss of use, or their inability to rent that vehicle, while the car is fixed.
Have Rental Reimbursement Coverage
Also known as substitute transportation, this coverage is essential if you want to avoid large out-of-pocket costs for a rental car should your car be involved in an accident. Cost of this coverage will vary since carriers allow you to choose a dollar limit ($15, $20, $30 or more per day).  Because it is fairly inexpensive, this coverage can pay off the first time you have to use it.
How Do I Insure a Leased Vehicle or a Vehicle with a Loan?
If you’re in a lease or considering a leased vehicle, remember that the lease contract will require you to carry a specific minimum coverage on your auto insurance. Most require that you maintain Bodily Injury Liability and Uninsured/Under-insured Liability of $100,000/$300,000. Lease vehicles also limit the maximum deductible on your policy: often $1,000 is the maximum allowed deductible.  If you take out a loan on a newly purchased car, you won’t have any specific requirements for liability coverage.  Though you can choose your own liability limits, you will need to have comprehensive and collision insurance as a requirement of the loan. GAP coverage, also known as Loan/Lease coverage, provides reimbursement when a total loss occurs to a vehicle and the amount you get from the insurance company is less than the amount you own on the loan. GAP coverage pays the difference between the totaled value and loan amount.  If you put a large amount of cash down on a new purchase or if you use your trade in value to gain equity on your new car, you might be able to go without GAP coverage. Since interest rates are low, many auto dealers offer sign-and-drive,  $0 down, or deferred payment deals on new car purchases. It’s very important to have GAP coverage in these situations, as the depreciation of a new vehicle in the first year often drops the vehicle’s value faster than you can pay down your loan.
Take a Safety Driving Course
If you’re looking to lower your auto insurance premium, you might consider enrolling in a safety driving course. There’s a range of options to choose from, including driver’s education and defensive driving. Car insurers love to see that their customers care about driving safe and the completion of one of these courses typically results in a premium discount. These courses vary in price, starting around $50 with rates discounted 10-15%.
Shop Regularly
The most important piece of information to know when it comes to car insurance is that you must shop around. Browse, research, compare quotes, and shop regularly. Check out other car insurance carriers even if your policy isn’t up yet. You never know what one provider will offer you in comparison. Shopping around is also the best tactic to beat price optimization. Some car insurers are using data to determine which customers are least likely to switch carriers, and are then raising their rates because of that. Because pricing intelligence is relatively new, few legalities exist. For now, shopping for quotes regularly is the best way to insure you are getting quality car insurance at the price you deserve.
Consider Before You Buy
When purchasing or leasing a new or used vehicle, you might want to first consider your car insurance premium. Many factors determine car insurance rates; primarily driving history and location, but car make and model can also influence the price. Depending on whether a car is old or new, has few or many safety features, and has high or cheap replacement costs can all determine your premium rate. Typically, more expensive cars cost more to insure. Consider your options by comparing quotes before purchasing a car.
Safeguard Your Vehicle
One way to save money on your auto insurance is to upgrade your safety features. Your vehicle likely has several safeguards already including airbags and quality seatbelts. Upgrading to an automatic braking system or other collision avoidance system can keep you safe and save you money. Anti-theft devices work the same way and even obtaining VIN etchings can come with a discount. When speaking with an agent, be sure to mention all of your vehicle’s extra features.
Ask and Ask Again
Ask a lot of questions. To get the best deal on auto insurance, you need to. If you’re confused about your policy details or what type of coverage is available to you, speak up. It also never hurts to ask about potential discounts and to let your agent know whenever anything concerning your driving situation changes.
Bundle Up On Insurance
Bundling up on insurance policies can sometimes save you money. If you need home or life insurance, consider buying them from the same company as your auto insurance. Providers will typically offer a discount known as a “bundle discount” or “multi-policy discount” to customers who are purchasing more than one form of insurance. Savings can be up to 25%.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
