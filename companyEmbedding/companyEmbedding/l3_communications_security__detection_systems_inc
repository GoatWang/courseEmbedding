Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 1 of 14

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS 







Civil Action No. 04-11884 NG 
(Magistrate Judge Judith Gail Dein) 



L-3 COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY AND 
DETECTION SYSTEMS, INC. 
Plaintiff, 

v. 

REVEAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, 
INC. 

Defendant. 



L-3’S OBJECTIONS TO MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S REPORT AND 

RECOMMENDATION 





Plaintiff, L-3 Communications Security and Detection Systems, Inc. (“L-3”), 

respectfully objects to the proposed findings and recommendations set forth in the 

Report and Recommendation on Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and 

on Defendant’s Motion To Stay and/or Quash (D.I. 87). 



In particular, L-3 objects to the recommendation that the summary judgment 

motion it filed on June 13 be denied, without any consideration of its merits. 

Summary of Argument 



L-3 sued Reveal Imaging Technologies, Inc. (“Reveal”) for patent infringement in 

August 2004. After Reveal engineered a series of procedural delays (based on the 

unfounded assertion – ultimately withdrawn – that it had a dispositive defense), 

discovery finally began in January on the merits of the infringement case. The 

documentary evidence established, without factual dispute, the structure of Reveal’s 

system. As subsequently confirmed by Reveal’s deposition testimony, this system is 

covered by several claims in each of two L-3 patents. There is thus no genuine dispute 

that Reveal infringes these patents. Accordingly, L-3 moved for summary judgment. 

915534.1 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 2 of 14



Reveal refused to respond to the motion, seeking instead to have it stayed. Its 

arguments for a stay were erroneous: It argued, first, that it needed more discovery, yet 

it failed to support this assertion with the required Rule 56(f) affidavit or any equivalent 

information establishing what discovery it needed that could possibly alter the outcome. 

Indeed there is none. Inventor depositions would make no difference, as the sole issue 

in dispute (claim construction) is one of law, not fact, which, according the to the 

Federal Circuit turns on the patent’s own intrinsic evidence, not on the inventors’ 

testimony. Secondly, Reveal erroneously claimed that a Markman hearing must 

precede summary judgment motions on infringement. Both the Federal Circuit and the 

Chief Judge of this District have expressly held to the contrary. 



Accordingly, there is no basis for further delay. Reveal should be required to 

respond to the dispositive motion so that the case can be expeditiously resolved on the 

merits. 

Procedural Posture and Background 



L-3 instituted this patent infringement suit on August 30, 2004 (D.I. 1), originally 

asserting that Reveal had infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,721,391 by making and using a 

certain explosives detection system (named “the CT-80”) for use by airports and airlines 

in screening passenger baggage and cargo. 



L-3 served an Amended Complaint (D.I. 5) on September 22, 2004, alleging 

infringement of two additional patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,838,758 (“the ‘758 patent”) 

and 5,642,393 (“the ‘393 patent”).1 These are the two patents that are the subject of 


1 L-3 subsequently served a Second Amended Complaint (D.I. 62) on March 15, 2005, 
alleging infringement of three more patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,707,879; 5,712,926; 
and 5,905,806. 



- 2 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 3 of 14

L-3’s June 13, 2005 motion for summary judgment of infringement. 



Rather than responding to the Amended Complaint, Reveal filed a motion to 

dismiss the entire action under Rule 12(b)(6), asserting that all of its infringing acts were 

immunized under 28 U.S.C. §1498.2 (See D.I. 7). Reveal refused to allow L-3 to take 

any discovery on the §1498 defense prior to filing an opposition, even though virtually 

all facts concerning the defense were exclusively within Reveal’s control. (See D.I. 19 

at ¶¶ 6, 7). 



In its opposition to the motion to dismiss (D.I. 20), L-3 identified evidence of 

numerous uses of the CT-80 that could not possibly be immunized under §1498.3 

Reveal then backtracked and conceded that L-3 was entitled to some discovery before 

the motion could be decided. It refused to withdraw the motion to dismiss, however, 

and instead moved for a protective order that would effectively bring the case to a 

standstill except for discovery relating to its motion, which it continued to claim would be 

dispositive of the entire case. (See D.I. 22). In view of Reveal’s representations, and 

over L-3’s objections, the Magistrate Judge allowed Reveal’s motion and set a schedule 

for “limited discovery” and briefing on the motion. (D.I. 25, 30). 



On January 14, 2005 (more than three months after Reveal filed its motion to 

dismiss – and when L-3 was finally poised to take its deposition), Reveal submitted a 

letter to the Magistrate Judge acknowledging that it had used the CT-80 in a manner 

that was not immunized under §1498. Reveal had to have known of its own uses of the 


2 A detailed discussion of the purpose and effect of 28 U.S.C. §1498 is provided in L-3’s 
Opposition to Defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. (D.I. 20) 
3 For example, Reveal was engaged in sales efforts in Europe, yet admitted that its only 
manufacturing location was in the U.S. Thus, Reveal’s infringing acts in the U.S. (such 
as manufacturing the CT-80) were plainly not solely for sale to the U.S. Government, as 
Reveal had claimed in its § 1498 motion. 


- 3 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 4 of 14

CT-80 before it filed its motion (and during the several months while the motion was 

pending), since whether such uses occurred was the central issue raised by the motion. 

In spite of this knowledge, Reveal had represented to the Court that its motion to 

dismiss could be dispositive, thereby delaying the start of discovery on the merits of the 

case for several months. 



In January, discovery finally opened on the core issue to be resolved in this 

case, namely whether Reveal’s product infringes. As all the documentary evidence 

shows – and as Reveal’s own deposition testimony confirmed – it plainly does. Indeed, 

Reveal’s deposition testimony concerning the structure and function of its CT-80 system 

established that the aspects of the system relevant to the asserted claims of the ‘758 

and ‘393 patents are not in dispute, and are thus amenable to summary judgment. L-3 

accordingly moved for partial summary judgment that Reveal has infringed those 

patents. (See D.I. 79). Further confirming the absence of any genuine dispute, L-3’s 

statement of undisputed facts (D.I. 80) relied exclusively on Reveal’s own deposition 

testimony and documents to illustrate the relevant structure and manner of operation of 

the CT-80.4 As noted in its memorandum (D.I. 81 at 17-18), the case law clearly holds 

that summary judgment should be granted (one way or the other) on infringement when 

the parties do not disagree about the structure of the accused product. 



Instead of responding to the motion, however, Reveal filed a motion requesting 

that the summary judgment motion be stayed. Consistent with its ongoing strategy of 

attempting to delay the resolution of this case for as long as possible in the apparent 

hope of obtaining a foothold in the industry through the use of infringing technology, 


4 L-3 had asked Reveal, in an interrogatory, to state the basis for its noninfringement 
position if it had one. Reveal provided no substantive response. 


- 4 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 5 of 14

Reveal refused even to address the merits of the motion. It did not identify any specific 

evidence whose discovery could or would help it show noninfringement, or otherwise 

alter the outcome of the case. It simply asked for leave to delay the day of reckoning 

until some much later time. Ironically, Reveal wrapped its request in rhetoric about 

L-3’s purported intent to use this litigation as a “tool” to harm a smaller competitor, 

seemingly oblivious to the fact that it is L-3 that is requesting that the case move 

promptly to a final resolution on the merits – a goal any party genuinely concerned with 

expense would presumably favor. 



The Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge was that Reveal’s 

motion to stay be allowed. It is respectfully suggested that this recommendation should 

not be adopted because it is based on Reveal’s erroneous contentions regarding both 

Federal Circuit law (regarding what is relevant to claim construction) and First Circuit 

law (regarding the requirements for obtaining a delay under Rule 56(f)). The case is 

ripe for resolution, and accordingly Reveal should be required to file its opposition to 

L-3’s motion for summary judgment within a reasonable time so that it may be acted on. 

ARGUMENT 



For the reasons outlined below, L-3’s summary judgment motion can, and 

should, be decided now. If granted, L-3’s motion would hasten the conclusion of this 

case, obviating much time and expense. 



Reveal’s motion to stay rested on two legal errors. First, Reveal argued that a 

lengthy Markman claim construction process needs to be followed before the Court can 

take up a dispositive motion addressing the issue of infringement. On-point case law 

both of the Federal Circuit and of this District is directly to the contrary. 



- 5 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 6 of 14



Second, Reveal suggested that a lengthy and complex discovery process needs 

to be followed before a summary judgment of infringement will be ripe. Again, the law 

is unequivocally to the contrary. The rule governing this issue – Rule 56(f) – requires a 

party seeking to rely on its protections to first prove that (a) there is a particular item or 

category of evidence that it has been unable, despite reasonable effort, to obtain, and 

(b) that this evidence would alter the outcome of the motion. Reveal neither met nor 

even attempted to meet either element of the test. It did not even file a Rule 56(f) 

affidavit as required to conform to that rule. Reveal’s entire argument on this issue was 

that it has not yet received some documents “from third party inventors.” (D.I. 84 at 7).5 

Missing was any allegation, let alone showing, that such discovery could possibly 

change the outcome. Indeed it cannot, since the question is not what the inventors 

might say in documents or even at their depositions, but rather whether the product 

Reveal makes is described by one or more claims set forth within the four corners of 

the patent itself. 



Reveal’s tactic, once again, is delay. Reveal had no answer when asked in an 

interrogatory why it does not infringe. When confronted with a detailed summary 

judgment motion, it still has no answer. Rule 1 exhorts the “just, speedy and 

inexpensive determination” of actions, and Rule 56 is an important mechanism for 

doing so. While Rule 56(f) allows carefully-defined exceptions, Reveal’s motion failed 

to make even the most rudimentary attempt to meet the requirements of Rule 56(f). 

I. 



A Markman Hearing Need Not Precede Summary Judgment Rulings. 

Reveal argued that a formal Markman claim construction hearing must precede 

resolution of L-3’s summary judgment motion on infringement. Markman itself is 


5 Reveal now has those documents. 


- 6 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 7 of 14

directly to the contrary. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 981 (Fed. 

Cir. 1995) (en banc) (claim construction “ordinarily can be accomplished by the court in 

framing its charge to the jury, but may also be done in the context of dispositive 

motions”) (emphasis added). The Federal Circuit emphasized this more recently in 

Ballard Medical Products v. Allegiance Healthcare Corp., 268 F.2d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 

2001). In Ballard, the district court adjudicated the question of infringement on 

summary judgment because the intrinsic patent evidence resolved the key claim 

construction issues as a matter of law. Id. at 1358. On appeal, the Federal Circuit 

rejected the argument that the district court was obliged to “conduct a detailed, 

limitation-by-limitation construction of each of the asserted claims” before issuing its 

summary judgment ruling: 

Contrary to Ballard’s contention, Markman does not require a district court 
to follow any particular procedure in conducting claim construction. It 
merely holds that claim construction is the province of the court, not a jury. 
To perform that task, some courts have found it useful to hold hearings 
and issue orders comprehensively construing the claims in issue. Such a 
procedure is not always necessary, however. If the district court 
considers one issue to be dispositive, the court may cut to the heart 
of the matter and need not exhaustively discuss all the other issues 
presented by the parties.. 


Id. (emphasis added). 


Accordingly, both the Federal Circuit and district courts – including the District of 



Massachusetts – have repeatedly concluded that where there is no dispute about the 

structure or function of the accused product, it is both appropriate and desirable to 

construe key claim limitations (a matter of law for the Court) in the context of a 

summary judgment motion. E.g., Karlin Technology Inc. v. Surgical Dynamics, Inc., 177 

F.3d 968, 975 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (reversing district court’s grant of summary judgment of 

non-infringement and granting summary judgment of infringement, after resolving 



- 7 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 8 of 14

disputed claim construction issue, because structure of accused product was not 

contested); Biogen, Inc. v. Berlex Labs., Inc., 113 F. Supp. 2d 77, 81 (D. Mass. 2000) 

(district court construed claims “in connection with” its decision on the parties’ summary 

judgment motions), aff’d in part, vacated in part on other grounds, 318 F.3d 1132 (Fed. 

Cir. 2003). 



Indeed, as Chief Judge Young has explained, a summary judgment motion on 

infringement is a “perfectly appropriate vehicle” for the task of resolving any claim 

construction issues that may arise. MediaCom Corp. v. Rates Technology, Inc., 4 

F.Supp.2d 17, 22 (D.Mass 1998) (noting that such issues are amenable to resolution 

“at a relatively early stage in the litigation” and that “[f]rom the standpoint of the 

litigants, earlier is generally better”) (emphasis added). 



Thus, although the Court may indeed need to decide an issue of claim 

construction when it rules upon L-3’s motion (assuming Reveal’s defense is that the 

claims mean something other than what L-3 believes they mean), a whole separate 

Markman process need not be followed to resolve these issues before a summary 

judgment motion is even briefed; on the contrary the two are properly considered 

together. Reveal’s insistence that they must be broken out into separate phases is 

contrary to applicable law and seems calculated to delay. 



Reveal’s further arguments that L-3 somehow “jumped the gun” on the case 

schedule by filing this motion were off the mark. The motion was filed only after the 

parties had exchanged proposed claim constructions on the two patents at issue in 

accordance with the Court’s April 29 Order, and after L-3 had taken deposition 

testimony of Reveal that established conclusively that the structure and function of the 



- 8 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 9 of 14

accused CT-80 product met of the limitations of the asserted patent claims.6 Any claim 

construction issues relevant to this motion can be briefed as part of the motion, and 

resolved in the Court’s ruling on the motion. 

II. 



L-3’s Motion Papers Suffice To Establish Infringement. 

Reveal argued that L-3’s motion was not supported by affidavits. But since the 

structure of Reveal’s product is not disputed, and since that structure is set forth in 

Reveal’s documents and deposition testimony, all of which are admissible evidence, 

further affidavits are unnecessary. As required by L.R. 56.1, L-3’s motion was 

accompanied by a concise statement of undisputed material facts. That statement set 

forth the relevant details of Reveal’s product, and was fully supported by citations to the 

record. 



Neither the structure nor the function of the accused product (the CT-80) is 

contested. The dispute is thus reduced to claim construction – a pure question of law. 

See Johnson Worldwide Associates, Inc. v. Zebco Corp., 175 F.3d 985, 988 (Fed. Cir. 

1999) (“Because the relevant aspects of the accused device’s structure and operation 

are undisputed in this case, the question of whether Zebco’s AutoGuide product 

infringed the claims of Johnson’s ‘835 patent turns on the interpretation of those 

claims”). 


6 Only after it was ordered to do so by the Court (see April 29 Order, ¶2), and after 
leveraging a delay of more than a month, Reveal finally allowed L-3 to take its 
deposition on the structure and function of its product, the CT-80. L-3 obtained 
testimony at that deposition that established conclusively that all of the asserted claims 
of the ‘758 and ‘393 patents are infringed by the CT-80. 



- 9 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 10 of 14

III. 

Reveal Has Not Made a Rule 56(f) Showing of Need for Further Delay. 



Reveal argued (citing Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) that it 

needs additional time to take fact discovery before it could respond to L-3’s motion. 

Infringement, however, is determined by comparing the structure or manner of 

operation of the accused product with the patents’ claims. See, e.g., Johnson 

Worldwide, 175 F.3d at 988. Reveal obviously needs no discovery as to the structure 

and function of its own product. Nor can Reveal properly require discovery as to the 

meaning of the asserted patent claims. The Court should construe the claims by 

reference only to the “intrinsic” evidence of the patent, which consists of the claims 

themselves, the patent specification, and the written prosecution history of the patent. 

Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronics, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Only 

such evidence as is within the four corners of these documents (all of which Reveal 

has) will bear on the meaning of the patent claim language. It is thus inconsistent with 

applicable law for Reveal to claim a need for discovery on this issue.7 



Indeed, Reveal’s motion does not identify a single item of discovery that it would 

actually need from L-3 to defend against L-3’s motion, let alone do so in a sworn 

affidavit as required by Rule 56(f). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) (“Should it appear from 

the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated 

present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may … 

order a continuance to permit … discovery to be had.”). Under such circumstances, the 

motion for a stay must be denied. 


7 The Federal Circuit yesterday reaffirmed the primacy of intrinsic evidence to claim 
construction, in Philips v. AWH Corp., __ F.3d __ (July 12, 2005) (en banc). 


- 10 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 11 of 14



In the First Circuit, a party seeking additional time under Rule 56(f) must be 

specific in explaining to the Court not just what discovery it needs to adequately 

respond to a summary judgment motion, but how that discovery would alter the 

outcome of the pending motion. E.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., 368 F.3d 

1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004) (“[A] petitioning party must offer the trial court more than optimistic 

surmise. He must give the court reason to believe that undiscovered facts exist and that 

those facts, if obtained, would help defeat the pending motion.”). In addition, the party 

must demonstrate a “realistic prospect that the facts can be obtained within a 

reasonable (additional) time, and will, if obtained, suffice to engender an issue both 

genuine and material.” Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 

F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988). 



In this case, Reveal has met neither requirement. Reveal offered no explanation 

of what additional discovery might be needed. It filed no affidavit as required by Rule 

56(f). Critically, it made no showing as to how any discovery it might obtain over the 

next several months would make any difference to the outcome of the summary 

judgment motion. Nor, of course, has it shown that it has made reasonable efforts to 

obtain such discovery and been unable to do so. Considering that it has not taken a 

single deposition in the nine months the case has been pending,8 Reveal could hardly 

meet that aspect of the test either. 



As the First Circuit has explained, “[a party] departs from the plain language of 

Rule 56(f) at his peril. When a departure occurs, the alternative proffer must simulate 


8 Reveal actually did notice over half a dozen depositions, only to cancel them all at the 
last minute (no doubt hoping to later argue – as it has now argued – that it needs more 
discovery). 


- 11 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 12 of 14

the rule in important ways. It should be made in written form and in a timely manner.... 

The statement must be made, if not by affidavit, then in some authoritative manner – 

say, by the party under penalty of perjury or by written representations of counsel 

subject to the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.” Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. 

Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988). 



Reveal has done none of this. The only hint it offers of what it could get from a 

Rule 56(f) delay is that it says it plans to depose the inventors of the patents-in-suit. 

But even if the Court were to overlook the dispositive obstacle that Rule 56(f) was not 

met (notwithstanding First Circuit authority to the contrary), Reveal has not even 

explained what evidence it hopes to discover by deposing individual inventors of the 

patents-in-suit, let alone how that evidence would alter the outcome of the pending 

motion. 



Indeed, such evidence cannot alter the outcome here. The testimony of 

inventors is considered to be particularly irrelevant to the issue of claim construction. 

Markman 52 F.3d at 985 (“The subjective invent of the inventor when he used a 

particular term is of little or no probative weight in determining the scope of a claim 

(except as documented in the prosecution history).”); Vitronics, 90 F.3d at 1584 (“Nor 

may the inventor’s subjective intent as to claim scope, when unexpressed in patent 

documents, have any effect”); Bell & Howell Document Management Products Co. v. 

Alteck Systems, 132 F.3d 701, 706 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“The testimony of an inventor and 

his attorney concerning claim construction is … entitled to little or no consideration”). In 

any event, as L-3 pointed out in its summary judgment brief (at 17), the words in the 



- 12 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 13 of 14

patents are not so divorced from any plain meaning that extrinsic evidence would be 

needed to construe the claims.9 



Finally, Reveal argued that summary judgment motions should not be filed 

“seriatim.” But that is not what L-3 is doing. If the pending motion is granted, and 

Reveal is found to infringe, the case could effectively be resolved. Indeed, in the case 

Reveal cites, Golden Trade S.R.L. v. Lee Apparent Co., 1997 WL 373715 (S.D.N.Y. 

1997), the problem was that the movant waited too long (until two years after the 

deadline) to file a summary judgment motion. Here, L-3 has filed the motion promptly in 

the hope of expediting the final resolution of the action. 


9 If Reveal actually could show that a particular deposition was critical to the outcome, 
then at most the dispositive motion should be delayed long enough for that deposition 
to be taken. L-3 can make its witnesses available forthwith. (Indeed it did so, but 
Reveal cancelled their depositions.) There is no need for a four-month delay. 


- 13 - 

Case 1:04-cv-11884-NG Document 88 Filed 07/13/2005 Page 14 of 14

CONCLUSION 



For the above reasons, L-3 respectfully objects to the magistrate judge’s 

recommendation, and requests that Reveal’s motion to stay be DENIED and that 

Reveal be ordered to respond to L-3’s motion for partial summary judgment forthwith.

What is ClearanceJobs?ClearanceJobs is a career website that connects recruiters and security-cleared candidates. Candidates post their resumes and search our database of jobs. Recruiters post jobs and search our database of cleared candidates. It’s like a matchmaking site for career connections.


































MISSION
ClearanceJobs serves individuals with active federal security clearances and provides a secure forum for employers to recruit cleared employees. It is the largest career site focused exclusively on candidates with active or current U.S. government security clearances.
 
HISTORY
ClearanceJobs was founded in July 2002 by Evan and Rachel Lesser. While they had the idea as early as the late 1990s while living and working in Northern Virginia, they didn't launch the site until 2002, after they moved to Atlanta and were spurred on by the need for qualified cleared talent following 9/11.
On September 16, 2004, ClearanceJobs was acquired by DHI Group, Inc.
In June 2010 ClearanceJobs launched the Cleared Network - the only vetted, password protected career networking platform designed exclusively for security-cleared professionals.
 
OUR TEAM
Meet the team behind ClearanceJobs, the largest career network dedicated to matching security-cleared candidates to government, defense and intelligence companies.
 
Who uses ClearanceJobs?
ClearanceJobs is used by over a thousand defense and intelligence contractors like Northrop Grumman, Booz Allen, Raytheon, General Dynamics, RAND, as well as federal government agencies including the CIA, FBI, Federal Reserve and National Laboratories.






 






A Word on Security
Safety, security and privacy are critical priorities for security-cleared professionals, and ClearanceJobs takes that seriously. ClearanceJobs is protected using the same encryption software that banks use. We are the only career network with end-to-end HTTPS traffic encryption.
