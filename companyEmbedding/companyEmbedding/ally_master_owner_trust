                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Quality of Wholesale Receivables: The trust receivables are floorplan 
      financing lines to financially stable and strong dealers for primarily 
      new vehicles (88.7%). 79.2% of the receivables were aged 1 to 120 days 
      and only 5.3% of the receivables were aged over 270 days. The 
      receivables are geographically diverse with.


                                        








Strength of Dealer Network: Based on a review of dealer financial 
      metrics and Ally's internal dealer credit classifications, the financial 
      health of Ally's dealer network is viewed as stable, with the majority 
      of dealers profitable through 2Q 2016. Historically high vehicle sales 
      and the strength of the used vehicle market over the past five years 
      have had positive effects on dealer financial health.


                                        








Stable Performance: AMOT is experiencing consistent performance trends, 
      including stable monthly payment rates (MPRs), asset yield, low agings 
      and minimal dealer defaults and trust losses. With vehicle sales 
      plateauing and inventory levels expected to rise heading into 2017, 
      Fitch expects trust performance metrics to normalize in the next couple 
      of years but remain healthy.


                                        








Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Each series of notes benefits from 
      subordination and a reserve account. Structural features such as early 
      amortization triggers mitigate risks of under-performance and exposure 
      to dealer/manufacturer defaults.


                                        








Asset Concentrations: Receivables in the trust are subject to 
      concentration limits mitigating the risk of individual dealer defaults 
      and losses. Exposure to individual vehicle types, manufacturers and 
      segments are mitigated with concentration limits in place.


                                        








Consistent Origination and Servicing: Ally demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator and servicer, as evidenced by the historical 
      delinquency and loss performance of AMOT.


                                        








Legal Analysis: The legal structure of the transaction provides that a 
      bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of payments on the 
      securities.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








To conduct a rating sensitivity for the outstanding notes, under a 
      category B DFP platform, Fitch assumes portfolio default levels at 5%, 
      10%, and 15% and under two recovery-level scenarios of 50% and 30%. 
      Fitch modeled each series with the assumption that the above defaults 
      have occurred, reflecting asset performance in a stressed environment. 
      However, to date, performance for the trust has remained strong. A 
      material deterioration would have to occur in performance to have 
      potential negative impact on the ratings for each series.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Quality of Wholesale Receivables: The trust receivables are floorplan 
      financing lines to financially stable and strong dealers for primarily 
      new vehicles (88.7%). 79.2% of the receivables were aged 1 to 120 days 
      and only 5.3% of the receivables were aged over 270 days. The 
      receivables are geographically diverse with.
    

      Strength of Dealer Network: Based on a review of dealer financial 
      metrics and Ally's internal dealer credit classifications, the financial 
      health of Ally's dealer network is viewed as stable, with the majority 
      of dealers profitable through 2Q 2016. Historically high vehicle sales 
      and the strength of the used vehicle market over the past five years 
      have had positive effects on dealer financial health.
    

      Stable Performance: AMOT is experiencing consistent performance trends, 
      including stable monthly payment rates (MPRs), asset yield, low agings 
      and minimal dealer defaults and trust losses. With vehicle sales 
      plateauing and inventory levels expected to rise heading into 2017, 
      Fitch expects trust performance metrics to normalize in the next couple 
      of years but remain healthy.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Each series of notes benefits from 
      subordination and a reserve account. Structural features such as early 
      amortization triggers mitigate risks of under-performance and exposure 
      to dealer/manufacturer defaults.
    

      Asset Concentrations: Receivables in the trust are subject to 
      concentration limits mitigating the risk of individual dealer defaults 
      and losses. Exposure to individual vehicle types, manufacturers and 
      segments are mitigated with concentration limits in place.
    

      Consistent Origination and Servicing: Ally demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator and servicer, as evidenced by the historical 
      delinquency and loss performance of AMOT.
    

      Legal Analysis: The legal structure of the transaction provides that a 
      bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of payments on the 
      securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      To conduct a rating sensitivity for the outstanding notes, under a 
      category B DFP platform, Fitch assumes portfolio default levels at 5%, 
      10%, and 15% and under two recovery-level scenarios of 50% and 30%. 
      Fitch modeled each series with the assumption that the above defaults 
      have occurred, reflecting asset performance in a stressed environment. 
      However, to date, performance for the trust has remained strong. A 
      material deterioration would have to occur in performance to have 
      potential negative impact on the ratings for each series.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may
