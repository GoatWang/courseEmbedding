Standard Process



	Given proper nutrition, the human body has an amazing ability to heal itself. To do so, we need to eat a healthier diet, exercise, and take high-quality supplements made from whole foods. Whole food supplements supply our bodies with nutrients we are not getting from our diet—all the vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, and phytonutrients that foods possess in a way that nature intended, in a whole food form. 




	Purification Program

	The Standard Process Purification Program is a structured program that helps patients cleanse and build healthy lifestyle habits. This 21-day program purifies, nourishes, and helps maintain healthy weight. Eight different purification program kits let you target the right cleanse for the right patient. The program comes with a helpful guide to keep your patients on track and explain detoxification and how the body transitions during a cleanse.*

	Fundamental Products

	Standard Process offers more than 160 whole food supplements. These products are easy to implement into any nutritional program, and many may become the foundation of your patients’ protocols. You can build a solid nutrition practice simply by offering the 24 Fundamentals products detailed here.
