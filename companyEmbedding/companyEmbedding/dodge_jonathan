Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last.

Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right.

And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

It's been said that after their home, a vehicle is the average person's next largest purchase, so from an investment standpoint you should maintain your car or truck to preserve its value. But regular maintenance and timely repairs are even more important for driving safety, and vehicles that run well get better mileage, are more reliable, and more fun to drive. We make it easy to keep your car or truck performing well and delivering reliable service because everything you need for maintenance and repair jobs can be found right here on our digital shelves. Instead of wondering whether there's an auto parts store near me that has the parts you want, just pick up the phone and we can have the right automotive parts delivered right to your door.
Preventive maintenance can help you avoid unexpected breakdowns and expensive repairs. Regular oil and filter changes are the most important maintenance tasks, so check out our large selection of conventional petroleum and synthetic lubricants for the weight you need. In addition to cartridge and spin-on oil filters for every application we also have air filters and cabin air filters to ensure your engine and passengers get clean air, as well as transmission filters to ensure clean fluid and precise shifting. From brake pad changes to shock replacement, cooling system flushes to fuel filter swaps, we have the maintenance and replacement auto parts you need to keep your vehicle running right, at better prices than you'll find at local auto parts stores.
But no matter how well you maintain your car or truck, the years and miles can take their toll and sooner or later auto parts wear out or fail. Engine parts like timing belts have factory specified replacement intervals, which if not adhered to can result in the engine stopping and possibly even expensive engine damage. Other parts like spark plugs should be inspected and replaced at recommended intervals and if this is not done performance and fuel mileage can deteriorate. Regular engine inspection is the best course of action so components like accessory drive belts and cooling system hoses can be replaced before they fail, and oil and coolant leaks can be repaired before fluid loss creates greater problems. But even if you suffer total engine failure, we can help with a complete replacement engine or the aftermarket parts you need to rebuild it yourself.
If your car or truck is louder than it used to be don't hesitate to inspect the exhaust system because along with the noise, noxious fumes can be escaping the system into the cabin. From manifolds to tailpipes, and everything in between, we have all your exhaust system repair parts needs including gaskets and hangers. Another unwelcome noise is the sound of metal-to-metal pad backing plate against brake rotor, and when you hear that more than just a pad change is in order. For that repair, hydraulic problems or any other brake issues you have, see our selection of brake parts including rotors, calipers, master cylinders and many more aftermarket car parts.
Our range of parts is vast but our space here is limited so we can't go into detail on all the auto repair and maintenance parts we offer. We've highlighted some of the most popular repair tasks but we have both car parts and truck parts for all other vehicle systems including suspension, heating and air conditioning, transmissions, drivelines and axles, fuel delivery, emissions control, and much more. Maintaining and properly repairing your vehicle is important, but everyone's pressed for time these days. Purchasing your auto parts online lets you schedule vehicle service at your convenience and allows you to devote the limited time you have to actually working on your car or truck, not wasting it driving to the local parts store and standing in line.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Dodge has been a name associated with respect for over a century. Founded by Dodge brothers Horace and John in 1900, the company got its start by building engine parts for several automobile companies in Detroit. Fourteen years later, John and Horace began to produce their own line of cars. It was during this time the company developed the Dodge Model 30, a direct competitor to Ford's Model T. The Model 30 featured a 4-cylinder engine and an all-steel body construction, making it the first of its kind. Success quickly followed the Model 30, helping launch Dodge Brothers in the 1920's with limitless promise waiting ahead. 
Walter Chrysler purchased Dodge Brothers in 1928, effectively changing the face of the company. Chrysler was more intent on using the Dodge name than he was the existing fleet of vehicles and come 1930, Dodge Brothers simply became known as Dodge. The WWII years saw Dodge become a staunch leader in the war effort, helping not only supply raw materials but also vehicles such as army trucks and ambulances (the WC54). The resourcefulness and goodwill carried over, as the brand celebrated more achievements in the postwar years thanks to sales of the Heavy-Duty, B Series, and Route Van, giving Dodge a reputation for versatility. Throughout the next couple of decades, Dodge broke through with a bevy of successful models, including the Dart, Charger, Challenger, and its modest but inspiring fleet of trucks. When the oil crisis on the 1970's hit its peak, Dodge was a step ahead thanks to its subcompact Omni. And then later on in the eighties, the arrivals of the infamous Caravan and K Car models helped stabilize the automaker's presence on the market.
Today, Dodge is still one of the most revered names in the world. With achievements such as the Dodge Ram, Dakota, Charger, Challenger, Caliber, and Viper, Dodge has forged ahead with as much innovation and dependability as ever before. The HEMI engine, one of Dodge's oldest and proudest accomplishments, has helped revolutionize the industry, demonstrating how 8 cylinders of power can be efficiently utilized while still conserving energy. Over fifty years after it was first developed, it is still an automotive marvel. Presently, Dodge models can be counted on for their bold styling, durability, performance, and family-friendly price tag. Sales of Dodge vehicles have always remained strong in recent years, despite economic struggles within the country's auto industry. This is due in large part to Dodge's ability to create and maintain awareness about its models using all forms of new-media, including aggressive internet advertising as well as being a sponsor for various video games and sports shows.
Dodge has remained a consistent force in the scene for decades, and that's due to its ever evolving product line as much as for the loyalty this company enjoys. The thunderous authority of their trucks and steadily performing SUVs and turbocharged cars effectively highlight the Dodge family. And when each model tells its own story you simply cannot help but listen intently. For those who drive the trucks or SUVs, many times it's the handling and rugged yet chic look. If it's the cars, it always seems to be the overwhelming road performance that blows people away. So what is it that you enjoy about your model?

It held up perfectly on the wind blown Oregon Coast and resisted the cold in the 4 feet of snow at Crater Lake Campground. We had several people stop and ask where we got it at and of course referred them to CARiD.com. Ours mounted on our 2004 Cadillac Escalade. We will probably never camp another way.

Storage SolutionsPlay VideoCheck out our  ChannelNothing Protects Like WeatherTech 01Bring Your Life Wherever You Go02A Whole New Look for Your Interior03The Dodge Avenger is a midsize sedan that was introduced for the 1995 model year. The Avenger has been available in two main body styles and has been a popular choice for the drivers owing to its sporty image, high-quality parts, and economical price tag. It first hit the road as a two-door coupe before Dodge redesigned it, and began to offer the model as a four-door sedan in 2008. For its first generation, the Avenger was outfitted with a 2.0L four-cylinder engine good for approximately 140 horsepower directed through either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. There were two main trim levels: the base Highline and the ES, which could be outfitted with a 2.5L V6 engine capable of 155 horsepower and 160 pounds-per-foot of torque. The ES also showcased 16" wheels, antilock brakes, a rear spoiler, air conditioning, cruise control, and optional leather seats. 
Throughout the rest of the 1990s, Dodge didn't give the Avenger any major parts redesigns, but chose instead to implement yearly changes (however subtle). In 1996, the ES received a round of improvements, most notably to the engine, which saw an increase in horsepower up to 163. The interior also featured new seat fabric. A year later, the Dodge Avenger Sport premiered as another trim level, featuring 16" wheels and a spoiler. ES models got new parts as well, this time with a new spoiler, 17" wheels, and the V6 engine made standard. 1999 welcomed in the arrival of a V6 engine and automatic transmission being made standard on all versions of the Avenger. This year brought in the inclusion of standard front airbags. 2000 became the (original) final model year of the Dodge Avenger. Upgrades were made across the board, with power accessories, cruise control, and four-wheel disc brakes becoming standard equipment. The ES trim offered leather seats, a power driver's seat, and remote entry, all included into the list of standard Dodge Avenger parts. The next year saw the Avenger was dropped from the Dodge lineup in favor of the Stratus, which was to be constructed off of the same platform as Mitsubishi's Eclipse. 
Dodge brought the Avenger back in 2007 in anticipation of the 2008 model year. The standard base engine is a 2.4L inline four-cylinder configuration mated to a four-speed automatic transmission and is found in both the SE and SXT trim levels. However, the SXT offers a 2.7L V6 that throws out up to 189 horsepower. The top-level R/T kicks it up a notch with an optional 3.5L V6 which churns out 235 horsepower geared to a six-speed automatic transmission that houses manual-shift mode. The base SE is equipped with cruise control, power accessories, a CD audio system, and air conditioning. The mid-level SXT is decked out with 17" wheels and antilock brakes. Avenger R/T variants show off the most sporty features, including a stiff sport-tuned suspension, automatic climate control, a six-disc CD/DVD entertainment system, and 18" wheels. As for safety features, front airbags and side-curtain airbags are standard on all versions of the model.
The Dodge Avenger has made its case as one of the most prominent models under the banner. While most in its class get by on mediocre performance and cookie-cutter looks, the Dodge Avenger steps up with a smoothly-styled body and the added "punch" to match. Drivers from all backgrounds have found reasons why they covet this car. Some enjoy the dependability. Others prefer the fashion potential. And even more are fond of the whole package. When it's time to find your Dodge Avenger accessories that complete the picture, this is the place to start.

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4.5 of 5Look GreatMGP® 12192SDD3RD - Gloss Red Caliper Covers with Dodge and Stripes Engraving (Full Kit, 4 pcs)Nice real metal made in USA. Wasn't sure if they would get noticed, but everyone has commented on their sporty appearance. After reading some reviews here,  was hopping to put them on without taking wheels off but that was not possible. Guess it depends on your rims.  Very happy with them so far, only a week on car.  There is one thing I have to keep an eye on however, want to make sure they stay put. Put the clips and screws on like the directions say, but I feel they might move or loosen. Not sure yet. So far , so good. MPosted by Michael J (Brooklyn, NY) / April 30, 20142014 Dodge AvengerWas this review helpful for you?
