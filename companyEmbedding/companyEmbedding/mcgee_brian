PLEASED TO MEET YOU
Hi, I’m Brian McGee.
Need an article or newsletter written? Stuck for your next blog? Up against a deadline? Or perhaps you have plenty of happy clients – but you’ve not got round to gathering testimonials. I’m here to help by writing, editing, reporting. That means listening to my clients and working in partnership.
Enough of me. It’s a pleasure to meet you.
Let’s get started.






How I Can Help






FIT TO DEADLINES
We agree on a deadline that works for your new website content, next blog or social media posts on Twitter – to name but a few examples. 
Whether it’s a deadline you’re up against or one we set together, I help you meet it.





TARGET DRIVEN
Working with and for you means clarity about what we want to achieve together. (On time, to the point, on budget.) 
Stylish, considered and accurate writing is at the heart of what I deliver. Your standards are high. Mine too.





BESPOKE FOR YOU
As a commissioning editor, business owner or marketing/PR/communications professional, it’s unlikely you want an off-the-peg product. 
Take your ideas and expertise, add my skills and experience; together we’ll create a tailored solution to the challenge you’re grappling with.

Clodagh Norton, Editor in chief, 2020EUROPE




“A true professional, Brian stepped in at short notice to help me out when my diary was overflowing and has since covered a number of marketing and market research conferences for me.
He quickly grasped the nature of the content and the house style and writes – to deadline – articles of the length required which need little editing.”
Brian Carruthers, News Editor, Warc.com




“It was great to work with Brian on a business proposal which needed a very fast turnaround. He was clear, quick and trustworthy. We will be working with him again and again.”
Jackie McGee (no relation to Brian!), JAMomentum

					Biographies





Name
Description




							Nicholas Woodman


					
							Mr. Nicholas Woodman serves as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Woodman got his start in 1998 by founding an online gaming company, Funbug.com. When that venture failed in 2001, Mr. Woodman planned an international surfing trip to look for inspiration. While preparing for that trip, Mr. Woodman had the idea for a 35mm film-based wrist camera that could be worn during sports like surfing, enabling the user to capture images while engaged in the sport. This idea became GoPro’s first product, the HERO Camera. In the years that followed, Mr. Woodman, along with friends, family and employees, innovated on the HERO Camera concept along with a wide array of mounting devices that would make it easy to mount the camera to everything from helmets to surfboards, vehicles and more. Mr. Woodman holds a B.A. in Visual Arts from the University of California, San Diego. We believe Mr. Woodman’s experience as the founder of GoPro and his knowledge of our products and customers give him the experience and leadership capabilities that qualify him to serve as a member of our board of directors.




							Brian McGee


					
							Mr. Brian McGee serves as Chief Financial Officer of the GoPro, Inc. Mr. McGee served as our Vice President of Finance from September 2015 to March 2016, and was responsible for financial planning, tax, treasury and risk management in that role.
