Jerry Gallagher















 To all our Oak Friends - 
 Jerry's ready smile and unfailing wisdom will be sorely missed in our industry. He always added a valuable perspective to any conversation I was fortunate enough to have with him. His memory will live on in all the people he touched and all the good work he did. We are thinking of you all and share your loss.
On behalf of all of us at Commonfund,
 
 Sue Carter  

 Jerry, 
 You were for decades an industry colleague, a mentor and most importantly, a friend. We miss your kindness, intellect and wisdom and our lives are a bit more lonely without you. But we feel your spirit and know you are indeed in a better place now. Rest in peace Jerry.
 
 Michael Chu, Catterton Partners  

 Condolences 
 Oak just lost one of its most honest and reliable partners - my sympathies to his family.
 
 Neil MacNeill  

 Jerry, 
 In the past week not a day has gone by where I haven't had multiple conversations about you and what you meant to others. So many in the Consumer, Retail, Restaurant, Investment Banking and Private Equity communities were touched by your wisdom, your integrity and your moral compass. You had a significant impact on the careers of many many people, and left a legacy which will carry on for a long time. I will miss our golf games at Martis, your annual stock pick, and most of all your guidance and genuine laughter. You will be greatly missed. Susan and I send our thoughts to Ellen and your family.
 
 Murray Huneke  

 Dear Ellen and the Oak Family,  
 I am stunned to learn of Jerry's passing.  He was a true friend and one of the pillars that kept DLJ strong during some difficult early days.  His professionalism and loyalty were an inspiration to us all.  He was the best — tops in his field and a wonderful human being.  I was not aware of how extensive Jerry's work was in financing student aid through the Gallagher Foundation, and I will be making a contribution to this cause.  I have been blessed with the friendship of a wonderful guy — Jerry — for nearly 50 years.  Please accept my deepest sympathy on your great loss.
 
 Sincerely, Dick Jenrette  

 To the Oak Family, 
 I was so saddened to hear of Jerry's passing.  He was a unique and amazing man and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.  Over the years, I often find myself trying to channel the integrity and clarity of thought that Jerry brought to every situation he encountered.  His investment acumen and ability to identify and grow interesting retail concepts into businesses that have impacted countless lives speaks for itself.  I feel immensely lucky to have worked and learned from him.  He will be missed.
 
 Munir Javeri   

 Condolences 
 I am so honored to have gotten to know Jerry these past 7 years. He was always so friendly and caring to everyone he met. Always ready with some humor to make me laugh.  We will miss you greatly here in the West. My thoughts and prayers are with you all at this time.
 
 Tralynn Gray  

 Condolences 
 Jerry was truly beloved by all of us at Oak as he personified being a great partner and colleague.  His sudden passing is a terrible loss for the entire Oak organization and I along with everyone will miss him.  Jerry’s honorable legacy of building a wonderful family and career will remain an inspiration for all who knew him.
 
 Bandel Carano  

 Jerry 
 Your warmth, wisdom, wit and thoughtfulness will be greatly missed.  My deepest condolences to the Gallagher family.
 
 Laura Miller  

 Condolences 
 Your wisdom, thoughtfulness, and friendship was something special.  You will always be in our hearts and a great example for all of us.
 
 John Beletic  

 Condolences 
 I am so very sorry to hear of Jerry passing away.
He will indeed be sadly missed.
 
 Michael Ashall, Vencap  

 Jerry 
 Jerry embodied what is best in a venture capitalist.  He was extremely bright, hard working, and personable.  He approached each opportunity as a chance to bring together a great management team, an exciting concept and enabling capital to build a lasting, growing and profitable company.  Rare amongst his peers, he possessed exceptional analytical skills with an ability to imagine and envision how a dream could blossom into something great.  He never wavered from his standard of unimpeachable integrity, and he clearly loved what he was doing.  He was an uncommon talent and an uncommon individual.  We will miss him.
 
 Tony Downer  

 Oak team: 
 I am so sorry to learn this news. What a gentleman. What an investor. What a person.
 
 Peter Denious, FLAG Captial.  

 Condolences 
 I first met Jerry during an interview in Minneapolis in 1989.  I remember being very impressed by Jerry following our initial meeting and that in part was one of the reasons I elected to join the PetSmart team.
Over the years, I had the opportunity to work with Jerry in a number of different circumstances and never failed to be impressed by his intelligence, character, integrity and insight.  Most importantly, Jerry was a very real human being who understood and related to people at all levels. He was a natural mentor and leader.
He will be missed.
 
 Sam Parker  

 To our friends at Oak, 
 We were deeply saddened to hear of Jerry's passing. Our deepest condolences go out to his family, friends and colleagues. He will be sorely missed.
 
 Marc de Saint Phalle, Managing Director, Director of Private Equity Bessemer Trust  

 Deepest Repect 
 Jerry represented the class and introspection which defines Oak. As a "lucky" entrepreneur who benefitted from Jerry's counsel. Will especially remember his warmth, encouragement and smile. I am smiling back to Jerry in his memory.
With deepest respect and sympathy to Jerry's family.
 
 Sherry Snyder, BioCatalyst International Inc.  

 Hi All, 
 Sad to know sudden demise of Jerry. Jerry was a great visionary and we can see his impact in industry at large . We pray to God let the departed soul Rest in Peace and give strength to his near and dear ones to bear the loss of losing him.
 
 Amreek Sandhu, CFO, Ybrant Digital Limited  

 Jerry, 
 We all are still reeling from the suddenness of your departure.   Up until this past week, you were so incredibly vibrant and as mission driven as ever.  Your contributions to Oak have been immeasurable both as an investor, partner and friend.  You always set the highest standards for all of us and then led by example.  We will continuously refer back to your life lessons that have influenced us all.  And your commitment to family, faith and community defined you as a person.  The aspirations of your Foundation where noteworthy and were matched by the great number of lives you so positively affected.   We are all so blessed to have known you Jerry.  May your soul rest in eternally peace.
 
 Fred Harman  

 Condolences 
 In sadness for his death, but with appreciation for his life, Jerry will be remembered as a warm and exceptionally talented man.  My deepest condolences to his family and colleagues.
 
 Elizabeth Holthe, BTIG  

 Condolences 
 From my first dinner interview in Minneapolis, to our last board discussion in San Francisco, Jerry has been a sage guide for what it means to be a rigorous thinker, detail-oriented investor and, above all, positive inspiration for human values and integrity.  He will be greatly missed, his loss hangs deeply in the One Medical community, and we offer his family any love and support we can provide.
 
 Tom Lee, One Medical  

 Condolences 
 Sorry to hear the sad news about Jerry. I never had the opportunity to meet him, but I know what an impressive and tight-knit group Oak is and can only imagine this is a terrible loss.
Best wishes,
 
 Justin, Duedil  

 Dear Friends from Oak, 
 Of course, we all knew of Jerry's impact on the industry.  I had met and talked to him over the years.  I appreciated his value system and his candid answers.  It is a great loss for mankind.
On behalf of the Red Herring team, our deepest condolences to his family and his lifelong partners.
Sincerely,
 
 Alex Vieux, Chairman, Red Herring  

 Condolences 
 My sincere condolences to you and the Oak’s team.
Best regards
 
 Imad Ghandour, CedarBridge  

 Sympathy 
 Extending my deep sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the Oak team and those left behind.
 
 Marie-Therese Afif  

 Jerry, 
 I’m incredibly grateful that I was able to meet you and work with you starting a little over fifteen years ago. Watching how you conducted yourself with everyone around you deeply inspired me. I was in awe of your grace, kindness and capability. Thank you for being my role model for how to act as a venture capitalist and more importantly, how to engage in life. You touched many lives and you’ll be sorely missed.
Rest in peace,
 
 Gus Tai, Trinity Ventures  

 To all on the Oak Team, 
 So sorry to hear of his passing. He was a bright light on the Xio Board. His enthusiasm for the business and his tenacity are what I will remember the most. Nothing worse than to hear him say “Well, I’m just a retail guy , BUT”. What followed was always precisely communicated and always right on point for the business. He had that special gift of wry humor  that Irishmen have when they are born on St Patrick’s day. I’ll miss him.
 
 Casey Powell, Eagle II Consulting  

 Condolences 
 I wanted to send my condolences on Jerry Gallagher’s passing.  He was an amazing man.
 
 Brad Cohen, Ybrant  

 Jerry was remarkable.  
 Given a choice he would pick the most challenging route. In college, he majored in Aeronautical Engineering, which required that rigorous work be handed in….no BS; plus, an extra course had be taken for two years (compared to my Liberal Arts curriculum). This, when he had already had tasted retail and loved it. He joined the Navy and chose Nuclear Submarines, and months on patrol….under water. He understood that developing personal discipline, as well as being a problem solver would work across the board, and it turned out to be perfect preparation for Venture Capital.
Along the way we co-managed our 10th college reunion. His anticipation, preparation and ownership of results projected he would be a great partner at Oak. Four years later he joined the firm, and had a great 27 year run. His hard work, accountability and outstanding results inspire us all. Jerry was a true friend and model partner.
 
 Ed Glassmeyer  

 Condolences 
 So saddened to hear of Jerry's passing. I remember him as grounded and considerate. He was always kind to me, and had a lovely sense of humor. Condolences to his family and his Oak colleagues for a tremendous loss.
 
 Marge Rosenberg  

 Condolences 
 My deepest sympathies go out to Jerry's Family.
 
 Rita Kennedy Shugart  

 All, 
 On behalf of the attorneys and staff at Finn Dixon & Herling, I extend our sincere condolences to the Gallagher family and to all of you at Oak.  Jerry was a truly wonderful human being and a joy to know and work with.  He cared so deeply about Oak, his partners and colleagues, his companies and management teams and all those with whom he worked.  He will be missed by so many.
 
 Mike Herling, Finn Dixon & Herling LLP  

 Condolences 
 Jerry was a terrific venture capitalist and an even better human being.  He was a friend to me personally and to all of us at North Sky Capital.  He was smart, hard-working, thoughtful, kind and generous.  He was a prince of a guy!  Your classic do-gooder.  He lifted people up—entrepreneurs, as well as the poor and the needy.  This is a sad day for the venture community and a huge loss to our local community here in Minneapolis.
 
 Scott Barrington, North Sky Capital  

 Dear Oak Team, 
 I have had the incredible honor of working with Jerry over the past 5 years at Revolution Foods. Jerry invested in our team and mission because he truly believed that we could build a great company by changing the system in this nation to make healthy food accessible to all kids. I have learned so much from Jerry over these 5 years. He took a personal interest in my development as a first-time CEO and Mom and always went the extra mile to coach me through the wins and challenges at each strategic juncture. Jerry is a role model for building companies and teams the “right” way, taking no short cuts, and using the highest level of integrity to make each decision, no matter how big or small.  Jerry has been a true mentor to me and a true company builder for Revolution Foods. It has been one of the greatest honors of my career to work with and learn from him.  Kirsten and I, and the Revolution Foods team and Board, will continue to work diligently to build an impactful, systems-changing company that he would be proud of to honor his legacy and incredible contributions. On a personal level, I will miss Jerry so much and count my lucky stars for each minute we worked together.
With the deepest respect and gratitude,
 
 Kristin Richmond, Revolution Foods  

 Dear Jerry, 
 I have thoroughly enjoyed every interaction we have shared together the last 15 years.  You were one of the most thoughtful people I have ever met.  You left an amazing mark.
I have been inspired by your intelligence, kind spirit, leadership, charisma, professional and personal instincts.  In business, you have simply been one of the BEST that we have ever seen.  I am in complete awe of your career.  I will never forget the lessons you taught me around being a balanced thinker.  And you always talked about building great companies and the formula for its success.  Thank you for your words of wisdom and advice; I carry them with me in every business discussion I have. 
More important than business, you are the highest quality man.  Everyone you touched had the great pleasure of knowing you and had the utmost respect for you.  You have a wonderful family.  I am so happy to have met some of your family members.  Ellen is very special; you always talked so fondly of her.  She is a wonderful woman, the matriarch of your beautiful family.  I know everyone will miss you dearly. 
Words can’t describe how sad I am that you have left us.  I am thinking about you, and I know you are looking down on all of us. 
Rest in peace.
 
 Ren Riley  

 Jerry, 
 I will miss your sage advice, your kind words of support, your insightful perspective on the retail space and the global economic environment, your moral compass and always upbeat countenance. You have so much to be proud of, your incredible and impressive children , your amazing legacy of brand name investments, your foundation and unwavering commitment to your values. I will miss you terribly and know that you will sail through those pearly gates.
 
 Ann Lamont  

 I will greatly miss Jerry. 
 He had such a meaningful impact on our partnership, his CEOs and management teams, and me personally. He was tirelessly dedicated to building great businesses and he did it with the highest level of integrity, a strong work ethic, genuine caring for all of us, and a great sense of humor. The results from his professional career were undeniable as he helped build and grow a long list of leading retail and restaurant companies. Incisive, methodical, strategic – Jerry took the time to do the work, and he was simply the best at what he did. While a dedicated partner at Oak, all along the way it was always clear what was most important in his life – faith and family. Combined with his successful professional and generous philanthropic endeavors, Jerry made a lasting impact on everyone who knew him. Jerry is someone who I immensely respect and will never forget.
 
 Andrew Adams  

 Dear Jerry, 
 Thank you for being our unflappable beacon. Thank you for modeling steadfast conviction to the highest of values. Thank you for assuming fairness and dignity in all negotiations. Thank you for always listening, reflecting, and digesting to assure thoughtful guidance. Thank you for never shying from challenge. Thank you for letting your actions, not just your words, assure your family, your Partners, your companies, your staff, and your industry colleagues that you were unmistakably committed to a solution-- even those arduous and protracted ones. Thank you for not reacting, but rather responding. Thank you for always keeping our center. Thank you for coupling vision with methodical analysis. Thank you for living your convictions. Thank you for asking the hard questions. Thank you for wanting us all to be better and do more. 
You leave a tremendous void on this earth; I hope we honor your legacy in a way that reciprocates our tremendous pride in and gratitude for you. 
Rest in Peace, our dear friend,
 
 Grace Ames  

 All, 
 Please accept deepest condolences from all at Abbott. Jerry will be deeply missed. He was an icon of grace and class in a time where these attributes have largely vanished. He will leave an indelible memory.

History[edit]
The firm, founded in 1978, is based in Greenwich, Connecticut with offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, Minneapolis and Palo Alto, California. Since inception, Oak had invested in more than 480 companies and had raised more than $8.4 billion in investor commitments across 12 private equity funds.[1]
In May 2006, Oak raised its 12th fund, at $2.56 billion reportedly the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[2]
In 2015, Indian-born employee Iftikar Ahmed was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on suspicion of stealing US$65 million from the firm.[3] Ahmed was believed to have fled to India. In August 2015, Fortune reported that Mr. Ahmed had been detained in an Indian prison from May 22 until July 23 and that his passport had been confiscated.[4]
Investments[edit]
Oak invests across a range of stages: funding startup companies, funding spinouts of existing divisions and assets, and providing growth capital to later-stage companies. Oak also selectively invests in public companies through PIPE investments.
In December 2008, Oak invested $25 million in the online media outlet Huffington Post.[5]
Other notable Oak investments include eVoice,[6] Dick's Sporting Goods, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Office Depot, Petsmart, Polycom, nLIGHT, Sandisk, and Seagate.

Eliminating the void.
There are an estimated 60 million under-banked consumers in the US. Almost a decade ago, Oak recognized the value of NetSpend’s offerings and seized the opportunity to partner with us. Today, we are a leading provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards that empower these consumers with the convenience, security, and freedom to be self-banked.


Dan Henry, CEO, 
NETSPEND
 
  
   

 SEEING 
 THROUGH 
 
A major force of change. 
One of the larger problems with today’s healthcare system is a lack of transparency for costs. Castlight Health was founded in 2008 to provide individuals unbiased pricing information with which to make smart purchase decisions. With the backing of Oak, Castlight was able to significantly strengthen our solutions, enhance our team, and develop our strategy.


Gio Colella, M.D., CEO & CO-FOUNDER,

A foundation for connecting.  
Zayo helps carriers, enterprises, schools, and hospitals keep pace with their rapidly growing need for data and Internet bandwidth.  Oak’s investment has helped us grow our operations to include a fiber network that spans 218 markets and 45 states plus Washington, D.C.


Dan Caruso, CO-FOUNDER & CEO,
ZAYO GROUP
 
  
   

 LIFT 
 OFF 
 
Efficiency from the ground up.
At a time of a crucial acquisition in our growth story, Oak joined our investor syndicate and helped finance the acquisition in a very fast and responsive manner.  Ever since, we knew we could always count on strong financial and strategic support from Oak.  They have helped in shaping our international expansion plans and strategies and have been a consistently strong and supportive partner to Kayak.


STEVE HAFNER, CEO & CO-FOUNDER,
KAYAK
 
  
   

 Automate 
 Decisions 
 
Transforming financial services for a new generation. 
Oak came in to invest in Wonga after having followed the business for quite some time. But once they committed to invest, it was a fast and highly efficient process. Oak truly believes in our vision of transforming the financial services industry, and they bring a differentiated set of experiences with knowledge both of the Internet as well as financial services. Oak is a partner we can always count on and trust to be on our side for the long term.


Errol Damelin, Founder, 
WONGA
 
  
   

 ONE 
 STOP 
 
Bringing it all together. 
What if there were a single, web-based platform for managing benefits? That’s the idea behind Benefitfocus, which integrates benefits in a single place for employers, carriers, and consumers. Oak recognized the growing importance and demand for a solution for shopping, enrolling, and managing healthcare benefits in the cloud.


Shawn Jenkins, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
BENEFITFOCUS
 
  
   

 IT’S ALL IN 
 THE WHEELS 
 
Electric drives get traction.
With interest in hybrid and electric cars at a fever pitch, Protean Electric has developed an in-wheel electric drive system for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric light-duty vehicles. Our partnership with Oak has enabled us to develop a system that can improve vehicle fuel economy, add torque, increase power, and enable improved vehicle handling to both new and existing vehicles.


BOB PURCELL, Vice Chairman, 
PROTEAN ELECTRIC

History[edit]
The firm, founded in 1978, is based in Greenwich, Connecticut with offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, Minneapolis and Palo Alto, California. Since inception, Oak had invested in more than 480 companies and had raised more than $8.4 billion in investor commitments across 12 private equity funds.[1]
In May 2006, Oak raised its 12th fund, at $2.56 billion reportedly the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[2]
In 2015, Indian-born employee Iftikar Ahmed was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on suspicion of stealing US$65 million from the firm.[3] Ahmed was believed to have fled to India. In August 2015, Fortune reported that Mr. Ahmed had been detained in an Indian prison from May 22 until July 23 and that his passport had been confiscated.[4]
Investments[edit]
Oak invests across a range of stages: funding startup companies, funding spinouts of existing divisions and assets, and providing growth capital to later-stage companies. Oak also selectively invests in public companies through PIPE investments.
In December 2008, Oak invested $25 million in the online media outlet Huffington Post.[5]
Other notable Oak investments include eVoice,[6] Dick's Sporting Goods, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Office Depot, Petsmart, Polycom, nLIGHT, Sandisk, and Seagate.

 ON 
 Leaf Group 
 
Giving the world what it wants to know.
With information and entertainment now expected to be at everyone’s fingertips, it takes a determined company to make it happen. Today, Leaf Group—with Oak’s investment and partnership—is able to reach more than 125 million visitors every month across a rich portfolio of vertical web properties.


Sean Moriarty, CEO
Leaf Group
 
  
   

 take 
 charge 
 
Eliminating the void.
There are an estimated 60 million under-banked consumers in the US. Almost a decade ago, Oak recognized the value of NetSpend’s offerings and seized the opportunity to partner with us. Today, we are a leading provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards that empower these consumers with the convenience, security, and freedom to be self-banked.


Dan Henry, CEO, 
NETSPEND
 
  
   

 SEEING 
 THROUGH 
 
A major force of change. 
One of the larger problems with today’s healthcare system is a lack of transparency for costs. Castlight Health was founded in 2008 to provide individuals unbiased pricing information with which to make smart purchase decisions. With the backing of Oak, Castlight was able to significantly strengthen our solutions, enhance our team, and develop our strategy.


Gio Colella, M.D., CEO & CO-FOUNDER, 
CASTLIGHT HEALTH
 
  
   

 NATURAL 
 FUEL 
 
Clean times two.  
Sundrop Fuels moves forward with building the largest bio-gasoline plant in the world. With continued investment and guidance from Oak, the company has developed and is now in first commercial deployment of their high efficiency, proprietary technology for converting biomass into gasoline.


Wayne Simmons, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
SUNDROP FUELS
 
  
   

 FIBER 
 OPTIMISM 
 
A foundation for connecting.  
Zayo helps carriers, enterprises, schools, and hospitals keep pace with their rapidly growing need for data and Internet bandwidth.  Oak’s investment has helped us grow our operations to include a fiber network that spans 218 markets and 45 states plus Washington, D.C.


Dan Caruso, CO-FOUNDER & CEO,
ZAYO GROUP
 
  
   

 LIFT 
 OFF 
 
Efficiency from the ground up.
At a time of a crucial acquisition in our growth story, Oak joined our investor syndicate and helped finance the acquisition in a very fast and responsive manner.  Ever since, we knew we could always count on strong financial and strategic support from Oak.  They have helped in shaping our international expansion plans and strategies and have been a consistently strong and supportive partner to Kayak.


STEVE HAFNER, CEO & CO-FOUNDER,
KAYAK
 
  
   

 Automate 
 Decisions 
 
Transforming financial services for a new generation. 
Oak came in to invest in Wonga after having followed the business for quite some time. But once they committed to invest, it was a fast and highly efficient process. Oak truly believes in our vision of transforming the financial services industry, and they bring a differentiated set of experiences with knowledge both of the Internet as well as financial services. Oak is a partner we can always count on and trust to be on our side for the long term.


Errol Damelin, Founder, 
WONGA
 
  
   

 ONE 
 STOP 
 
Bringing it all together. 
What if there were a single, web-based platform for managing benefits? That’s the idea behind Benefitfocus, which integrates benefits in a single place for employers, carriers, and consumers. Oak recognized the growing importance and demand for a solution for shopping, enrolling, and managing healthcare benefits in the cloud.


Shawn Jenkins, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
BENEFITFOCUS
 
  
   

 IT’S ALL IN 
 THE WHEELS 
 
Electric drives get traction.
With interest in hybrid and electric cars at a fever pitch, Protean Electric has developed an in-wheel electric drive system for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric light-duty vehicles. Our partnership with Oak has enabled us to develop a system that can improve vehicle fuel economy, add torque, increase power, and enable improved vehicle handling to both new and existing vehicles.


BOB PURCELL, Vice Chairman, 
PROTEAN ELECTRIC
 
  
   

 SUPPORT 
 SUPREME 
 
Leading the way in outsourced services.  
When Fortune 1000 companies need an integrated, global provider of business process and technology management services, they look to Sutherland. Our singular focus is to drive business performance improvements and solutions that support the entire customer lifecycle. With investment and guidance from Oak, we have grown our global operations to the point where, today, we process over 13 million customer transactions for our clients every month.


Dilip Vellodi, CHAIRMAN AND CEO,
Sutherland Global Services
 
  
   

 GAME 
 ON 
 
Playing an entirely new ballgame. 
With the insatiable desire of sports fans all over the world to get news and information, Bleacher Report has emerged as the go-to source, delivering the Internet’s most engaging sports content experience. Oak’s partnership with the company has helped it grow to be the U.S.’s fourth-largest sports media site, reaching more than 25 million unique readers each month.


BRIAN GREY, CEO, 
BLEACHER REPORT
 
  
   

 COMPETITIVE 
 EDGE 
 
Customized financial services.  
Financial institutions are always looking for ways to enable better strategy, marketing, and risk decisions. Our unique data and analytics provide just that through competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to major financial institutions around the world. We partnered with Oak at an important time in Argus’ history. They provided us invaluable guidance and support as we expanded our solutions and took our business to a global scale.


Leonard Laufer, CEO, 
Argus Information & Advisory Services
 
  
   

 Automate 
 Decisions 
 
Deep clinical insights for managing medical payment policy.
Minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse is a substantial challenge for healthcare payer organizations. iHealth Technologies helps those payers ensure the proper and fair payment of claims. Oak has been a reliable partner in the planning and execution of our organic growth and acquisition strategy.

History[edit]
The firm, founded in 1978, is based in Greenwich, Connecticut with offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, Minneapolis and Palo Alto, California. Since inception, Oak had invested in more than 480 companies and had raised more than $8.4 billion in investor commitments across 12 private equity funds.[1]
In May 2006, Oak raised its 12th fund, at $2.56 billion reportedly the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[2]
In 2015, Indian-born employee Iftikar Ahmed was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on suspicion of stealing US$65 million from the firm.[3] Ahmed was believed to have fled to India. In August 2015, Fortune reported that Mr. Ahmed had been detained in an Indian prison from May 22 until July 23 and that his passport had been confiscated.[4]
Investments[edit]
Oak invests across a range of stages: funding startup companies, funding spinouts of existing divisions and assets, and providing growth capital to later-stage companies. Oak also selectively invests in public companies through PIPE investments.
In December 2008, Oak invested $25 million in the online media outlet Huffington Post.[5]
Other notable Oak investments include eVoice,[6] Dick's Sporting Goods, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Office Depot, Petsmart, Polycom, nLIGHT, Sandisk, and Seagate.

History[edit]
The firm, founded in 1978, is based in Greenwich, Connecticut with offices in Norwalk, Connecticut, Minneapolis and Palo Alto, California. Since inception, Oak had invested in more than 480 companies and had raised more than $8.4 billion in investor commitments across 12 private equity funds.[1]
In May 2006, Oak raised its 12th fund, at $2.56 billion reportedly the largest venture capital fund ever raised.[2]
In 2015, Indian-born employee Iftikar Ahmed was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on suspicion of stealing US$65 million from the firm.[3] Ahmed was believed to have fled to India. In August 2015, Fortune reported that Mr. Ahmed had been detained in an Indian prison from May 22 until July 23 and that his passport had been confiscated.[4]
Investments[edit]
Oak invests across a range of stages: funding startup companies, funding spinouts of existing divisions and assets, and providing growth capital to later-stage companies. Oak also selectively invests in public companies through PIPE investments.
In December 2008, Oak invested $25 million in the online media outlet Huffington Post.[5]
Other notable Oak investments include eVoice,[6] Dick's Sporting Goods, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Office Depot, Petsmart, Polycom, nLIGHT, Sandisk, and Seagate.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
