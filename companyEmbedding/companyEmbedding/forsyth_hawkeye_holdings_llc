Barry-Wehmiller’s Forsyth Capital Acquires HawkeyePedershaab from Kohlberg









 Lifen Tang, September 21, 2016September 21, 2016 


 

St. Louis, Missouri-based Forsyth Capital Investors LLC, an investment firm targeting the manufacturing and insurance services sectors, has completed the acquisition of HawkeyePedershaab Inc. from New York private equity firm Kohlberg & Co.
Forsyth Capital Investors is a subsidiary of Barry-Wehmiller Cos. Inc., a diversified capital equipment manufacturer founded in 1885, with almost 6,000 employees at over 50 locations worldwide, and revenues of $1.4 billion. In 2016, Barry-Wehmiller was ranked as the 10th largest privately held company in St. Louis, by the St. Louis Business Journal.
Established in 1915 and headquartered in Mediapolis, Iowa, HawkeyePedershaab designs, engineers, and manufactures a broad range of capital equipment for the production of concrete pipe and manholes and provides aftermarket products and services used in concrete component production. The company will continue to operate from its Mediapolis, Iowa and Bronderslev, Denmark facilities.
In 2007, Kohlberg acquired the Iowa-based company, formerly known as Hawkeye Concrete, from the Schmidgall founding family. In 2008, Hawkeye merged with Danish company Pedershaab, forming HawkeyePedershaab.
“We are thrilled to partner with HawkeyePedershaab’s talented leadership team and its 278 team members worldwide whose commitment to providing the highest quality products and services have established the company as a market leader,” said Ryan Gable, Forsyth Capital co-founder and managing director.
“The Forsyth Capital team brings a wealth of relevant operational expertise and value-creating strategies to our company, giving us tremendous confidence that we can further enhance our existing business and accelerate the growth of our global platform in the years to come,” said HawkeyePedershaab’s chief executive Vernon Cameron.
HawkeyePedershaab was represented by midmarket M&A and debt advisory firm Livingstone.
