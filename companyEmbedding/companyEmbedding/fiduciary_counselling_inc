Litigation involving plan sponsors can impact the level of plan assets and benefits, sometimes in a significant way.

We will assume full responsibility for the selection, monitoring, and, if appropriate, termination of investment managers or mutual funds.

For 401(k) plans we select, monitor, and, if necessary terminate, investment managers or mutual funds
For defined benefit plans, we assume sole responsibility and full discretionary authority for the plan’s assets

See Case Studies One and Two.
Review & Analysis
We will review fund of fund managers, including evaluation of the manager’s internal practices and capabilities. We can also be responsible for the monitoring of portfolio structuring, performance and operation relative to fund objectives and guidelines.
Asset Transfers
We will serve as the independent fiduciary for a range of engagements involving the transfer of assets between benefit plans or between funds or other investment vehicles. While these engagements all differ in certain aspects, they all involve:

Overseeing the transfer of assets
Reviewing and confirming valuations and ensuring compliance with procedures and portfolio mandates
Determining that the transfer was handled in a reasonable fashion consistent with the terms of a fund or plan.

See Case Studies Three, Four, and Five

Annuities

Overview
The purchase of annuities can be used to settle some or all of a defined benefit plan’s benefit obligations when a plan sponsor concludes settling the obligations is an appropriate way to address the obligations and related impacts on the plan sponsor’s balance sheet. The decision to settle pension obligations is a non-fiduciary decision of the plan sponsor, while the selection of the insurer or insurers and the contract structure is a fiduciary decision. In a plan termination, the purchase of annuities satisfies all of the plan’s benefit obligations as the insurance carrier assumes responsibility for all liabilities. In other instances, the purchase of annuities can be used to settle the benefits for a subset of plan participants such as current retirees. In a spin-off termination, assets and liabilities for the participants to be annuitized are spun off, then the spun-off plan is terminated and annuities are purchased.  In an annuity buy-out, there is no termination, but the plan purchases annuities for a subset of participants and transfers all related obligations to the insurer.
It is also possible for a plan to invest in an annuity contract while retaining the obligation to pay participants (an annuity buy-in), but this has been less prevalent of late, since the primary driver of annuitization has been the desire of plan sponsors to settle pension liabilities.
In any case, the selection of an annuity provider in connection with benefit distributions is a fiduciary act governed by the fiduciary standards of section 404(a)(1) of ERISA, including the duty to act prudently and solely in the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries.
The Department of Labor, in its Interpretive Bulletin 95-1 (“IB 95-1”), provides that plan fiduciaries must take steps calculated to obtain the safest available annuity and must conduct an objective, thorough and analytical search for purposes of identifying providers from which to purchase annuities. It goes on to set forth six factors that should be considered by fiduciaries in evaluating a potential provider’s claims paying ability and creditworthiness. IB 95-1 emphasizes that the selection must be made in the interest of participants, not the plan sponsor. Although some courts have said the purchase of the safest available annuity may not be necessary, they still have emphasized that fiduciaries must act in the interest of participants and prevent conflicting interests from entering the decision-making process.
Congress amended ERISA to make clear that the safest available annuity standard does not apply to annuity purchases made available to participants in defined contribution plans. The DOL has issued separate guidance for those plans.
What We Do
Fiduciary Counselors assumes full fiduciary responsibility for the selection of an insurance carrier(s) to provide the annuity. Delegating full fiduciary responsibility to an independent fiduciary is intended to remove any real or perceived conflict of interest and show the selection was indeed completed in a manner that protects the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is consistent with DOL guidance on this matter.
As independent fiduciary, benefit security is of paramount importance in all situations; however, the size of the annuity purchase will ultimately determine whether a potential insurer will entertain certain features such as a separate account and whether transaction specific documents will be negotiated. A smaller transaction would most likely use a standard annuity agreement while, for the larger transaction, a complex definitive purchase agreement and group annuity contract would be negotiated for that single transaction.
In any case, Fiduciary Counselors, working with experts in the insurance industry, will analyze the available options, represent the interests of plan participants, ensure compliance with the fiduciary standards of ERISA, and make a determination that the annuity selection is consistent with the DOL guidance found in IB 95-1.
Experience
We have served as the independent fiduciary for eleven annuity purchases totaling approximately $12.0 billion for plans including:
–        Verizon ($7.5 billion)
–        Bristol-Myers Squibb ($1.4 billion)
–        JCPenney
–        Visteon ($350 million)
–        Enron ($245 million)
In 2015, in addition to JCPenney, we have served as independent fiduciary for three annuity purchases totaling $1.3 billion. Our experience covers annuity purchases smaller than those listed, including purchases below $5 million. We are highly qualified to handle annuity purchases of any size.
Next Steps
Fiduciary Counselors has experience in ensuring that the placement of annuities is handled in a manner consistent with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the guidance of the DOL’s IB 95-1. We welcome the opportunity to discuss any situation in greater detail. Please contact us if you’d like to explore our solutions.

Plan Administration

Overview
There are a number of situations where an independent plan administrator may be required to manage the on-going operation of a plan.
Company operations may cease as a result of bankruptcy or financial distress and can leave the benefit plans without a plan sponsor. Fiduciary Counselors can act as the plan administrator and named fiduciary for plans in these situations. We have fulfilled this role in a number of cases, most recently for the Enron Corp. Savings Plan and for four plans maintained by plan sponsors in the Revstone Industries controlled group. Often we have been responsible for the orderly wind up of the plan’s affairs, including final distributions to plan participants and beneficiaries.
In addition to serving as the plan administrator for plans with troubled or absent sponsors, Fiduciary Counselors can step into the role of independent fiduciary for non-qualified plans such as severance plans or other supplemental plans. Often, the responsibilities of an independent third party are specified under the terms of a plan or trust.
What We Do
Fiduciary Counselors is capable of stepping into the role of plan administrator and assuming responsibility for:

Overseeing the investment of plan assets;
Manage plan service providers and oversee the Administration of plan benefits, including final participant distributions;
Preparing and coordinating the plan’s final regulatory filings;
Calculating plan benefits under supplemental retirement plans;
Making benefit determinations under the terms of a plan;
Handling participant or beneficiary appeals;
Communicating with participants and beneficiaries, as appropriate.

Experience

We assumed full responsibility for a defined benefit plan where the plan sponsor had entered bankruptcy. We developed an investment policy consistent with the plan’s liabilities and anticipated termination and then restructured the portfolio investments accordingly. This involved selling equity assets, reinvesting the proceeds into a number of fixed income positions, negotiating disposition of several private investment positions and actively managing the cash position to cover variable levels of lump sum distributions.

In this case, the plan sponsor had acquired a number of plans through merger.  We worked with the plan sponsor to transition plan recordkeeping operations to an outsourced provider, where records were incomplete in many cases because of the acquisition activity. We developed plan communications, and managed the outsourced provider service agreement.  We worked with the trustee to resolve distribution issues: missing participants, lost checks and stale checks. We were responsible for assuring that all regulatory filings were made and that the plan remained in compliance during our assignment.
We assumed full responsibility for a defined contribution plan where the plan sponsor had entered bankruptcy under Chapter 11, which was converted to a Chapter 7.  We worked with the plan sponsor and the investment advisor to establish a reserve account for payment of plan expenses related to distributing the assets to participants.  We maintained an investment array that was appropriate for the period during which the plan assets were distributed.  After an extensive search for missing participants, we established rollover IRAs for them. We were responsible for assuring that all regulatory filings were made and that the plan remained in compliance during our assignment.

In each of the above examples, we worked cooperatively with investment managers, plan consultants, trustees, auditors and other vendors as frequently as necessary to ensure optimal resolution for plan participants.
Next Steps
The terms of any particular plan and the status of its sponsor will play a large role in determining the need for an independent plan administrator. Fiduciary Counselors has experience stepping into the role of plan administrator in both common and atypical scenarios. We welcome the opportunity to discuss any situation in greater detail.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
