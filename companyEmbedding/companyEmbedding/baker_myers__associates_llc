SEC Compliance Integration





SEC Mandatory Compliance Website InformationAnnual Report and Proxy Information (Rule 14a-16, Exchange Act)A company must post its annual report, proxy statement, and proxy card on a publicly available website other than EDGAR, if it delivers its proxy materials electronically. The website used for disclosing this information will typically be the company’s own website. The information must be presented in a format that is convenient for reading online and for printing.10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K (Item 101(e), Regulation S-K)Accelerated filers and large accelerated filers are required to post Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, including all amendments, on their websites. These forms must be posted as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the SEC. Access to the reports can be granted through a hyperlink to the SEC’s website or through a third party, so long as there is no charge associated with obtaining the information. It is recommended that information referenced within these reports be posted for at least 12 months.Forms 3, 4, and 5 (Rule 16a-3(k), Exchange Act)Forms 3, 4, and 5, including all exhibits and attachments, must be posted on the company’s website for at least 12 months. These reports must be posted by the end of the business day after they are filed with the SEC. They can be posted directly to the company’s website or through a hyperlink on the site. If a hyperlink is used, it must be separate from any other links and connect directly to these reports.XBRL Data (Rule 405, Regulation S-T)XBRL interactive data files must be posted on the company’s website by the end of the day that the company filed or was required to file the periodic report. This information cannot be provided with a hyperlink to the SEC website. It must remain posted on the company’s website for 12 months.Delisting Securities (Rule 12d2-2(c)(2)(iii), Exchange Act)A company must disclose its intention to delist or deregister its securities on its website. Additionally, the company must issue a press release stating its intention to delist these securities.Use of Conflict Minerals (Item 1.01(b) and (c), Form SD)Information about the use of conflict minerals, if any are required for the production or functionality of a product manufactured by the company, must be disclosed on the company’s website. The company must also provide a link to this information on Form SD.
SEC Optional Compliance Website InformationRegulation G (Rule 100, Regulation G and Item 2.02, Form 8-K)If non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed orally, the Regulation G requirements can be completed by posting the information to the company website and providing the website address during the presentation. It is recommended that this information be posted for at least 12 months.Earnings Calls (Rule 100, Regulation G and Item 2.02, Form 8-K)A company must make its earnings calls known to the public prior to the earnings call through a press release. Additionally, it must post an audio file to its website with all previously undisclosed information that was released during the call, in order to avoid filing an additional 8-K.

If new information is unexpectedly released during an earnings call, the information must be promptly posted to the company’s website. All earnings call information should be posted for 12 months.Regulation FD (Rules 100 and 101(e), Regulation FD)A company can use its website to make disclosures required under Regulation FD, if the website provides broad, non-exclusionary distribution of the information to the public. However, it will likely have to use other methods also, such as a press release or conference call, because disclosure on a website alone is generally considered insufficient.Audit/Compensation/Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter (Item 407(c-e), Regulation S-K and Instruction 2 to Item 407)If the company’s audit, compensation, or nominating and corporate governance committees have charters, the charters must be either included as an appendix to the company’s proxy statement at least once every three years or be posted on the company’s website and notated in the proxy statement that the charters are available on the website, with the website address included.Shareholder/Board Communication Procedures (Item 407(b) and (f), Regulation S-K)The shareholder/board communication policy and procedures must be either included as an appendix to the company’s proxy statement or be posted on the company’s website and notated in the proxy statement that they are available on the website, with the website address included.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."
