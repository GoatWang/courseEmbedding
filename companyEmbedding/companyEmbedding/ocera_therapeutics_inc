Ocera |   Company











































Focused on rare diseases and their ripple effects.







OCR-002 has been granted Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track status by the FDA for the treatment of hyperammonemia and resultant hepatic encephalopathy in patients with acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver disease.




Overview
Ocera Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OCRX) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for orphan and other serious growing liver diseases with high unmet medical need.
Ocera’s lead drug prorgam is OCR-002, a novel and validated ammonia scavenger which rapidly removes ammonia from the blood. Elevated ammonia is believed to be one of the primary causes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a neurocognitive disorder associated with serious liver disease. An intravenously-administered form of OCR-002 was the subject of a recently completed Phase 2b trial, STOP-HE, in patients hospitalized with HE, and an oral form of the study drug is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a trial in patients with cirrhosis. OCR-002 has received Orphan Drug designation and has been granted Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. See OCR-002 for additional information.
Products to Treat Acute and Chronic Orphan and Other Serious Growing Liver Diseases
Ocera’s drug candidate OCR-002 (ornithine phenylacetate) is a validated ammonia scavenger, designed to treat hyperammonemia (elevated ammonia in the blood) and associated hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of patients with liver cirrhosis or acute liver failure. When the liver is no longer able to remove toxic substances from the blood, there is an accumulation of such toxins, particularly ammonia. Ammonia accumulation in the blood impairs brain cell function, and can lead to a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy, or HE.

Ocera Therapeutics Announces Completion of Merger With Tranzyme

SAN DIEGO, July 15, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocera Therapeutics, Inc. ("Ocera"), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for orphan liver diseases, and Tranzyme, Inc. (Nasdaq:TZYM) ("Tranzyme") today announced that, following a special meeting of the shareholders of Tranzyme held on July 15, 2013, the Ocera and Tranzyme merger has closed. The combined company is named Ocera Therapeutics, Inc. and will trade beginning July 16, 2013 on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "OCRX". The combined company (the "Company") operates under the leadership of Linda S. Grais, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, and the board of directors consists of representatives from both the former Ocera and Tranzyme boards.

	Prior to the merger, Tranzyme effected a 12-to-1 reverse split of its outstanding common stock. After giving effect to the merger and the reverse stock split, the holder of each share of the common stock of pre-merger Ocera received approximately 0.11969414 shares of the Company's common stock. All options and warrants of pre-merger Ocera that were outstanding prior to the merger were assumed by Tranzyme in the merger.

	Immediately following the closing of the merger, certain of the Ocera investors, including Domain Associates, Thomas McNerney & Partners, Sofinnova Ventures, InterWest Partners, Greenspring Associates, Agechem, CDIB and Wasatch Advisors, invested approximately $20 million in the Company through a private placement financing at $6.0264 per share of post-split Company stock. Following the merger, the reverse split and the financing, the Company has approximately 11.3 million shares outstanding.

	"The closing of this merger represents an important milestone as Ocera joins forces with Tranzyme to develop OCR-002, a differentiated product candidate for orphan liver diseases," said Dr. Grais. "We look forward to advancing OCR-002, currently in Phase 2 development, to address a significant unmet need in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis."

	OCR-002 has received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and Europe and has been granted fast track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is estimated that there are up to one million patients with cirrhosis in the United States, and approximately 150,000 hospitalizations occur annually in the United States due to complications of hepatic encephalopathy, costing the healthcare system approximately $7 billion every year. For more information about clinical trials related to OCR-002, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About OCR-002

	OCR-002 (ornithine phenylacetate) is an ammonia scavenger designed to treat hyperammonemia and associated hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure and acute liver injury. OCR-002, through its dual mechanism of action, directly lowers circulating blood levels of ammonia. Ammonia accumulation in the blood impairs brain cell function. Hepatic encephalopathy is an often-reversible neuropsychiatric abnormality observed in patients with liver disease; it is marked by a worsening of brain function when the liver is no longer able to remove toxic substances such as ammonia from the blood. Signs of hepatic encephalopathy include impaired cognition, uncontrolled movements and decreased levels of consciousness leading to coma and death due to brain swelling. OCR-002 is being developed as an injectable formulation for hospitalized patients and as an oral 
formulation to treat and prevent recurrences of hepatic encephalopathy.

	Planning is underway to initiate a Company-sponsored Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy study of OCR-002 as an intravenous treatment for acute hepatic encephalopathy in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis. Enrollment is expected to begin in late 2013.

	OCR-002 also is the subject of two ongoing, externally-sponsored, Phase 2a studies in patients. Data from these studies are expected in 2014.About Ocera Therapeutics, Inc.

	Ocera Therapeutics, based in San Diego, California with an office in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary compounds to treat acute and chronic orphan liver diseases.

Ocera |   OCR-002







































































Novel. Simple. Hopeful.






Unlike currently approved therapies for HE, OCR-002 is unique in that it directly lowers circulating blood levels of ammonia through pathways that do not require liver function.




OCR-002
Ocera in-licensed OCR-002 (ornithine phenylacetate) from University College London. OCR-002 is an ammonia scavenger designed to rapidly lower abnormally elevated systemic ammonia levels (hyperammonemia) and treat hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with liver cirrhosis and acute liver failure.
With severe liver impairment, toxic substances that are normally removed by the liver, such as ammonia, accumulate in the blood. Elevated ammonia levels can cause swelling of the brain. Signs and symptoms of HE include impaired cognition, confusion, and a decreased level of consciousness which can progress to coma and ultimately death. Patients are currently treated with laxatives that help eliminate ammonia in the gut and antibiotics that target ammonia production.
Unlike currently approved therapies for HE, OCR-002 is unique in that it directly lowers circulating blood levels of ammonia through pathways that do not require liver function.
OCR-002 is in development as both an intravenous formulation which is well suited for the hospitalized population with acute HE, and as an oral formulation for potential step-down therapy and to provide a chronic use option to maintain remission of HE in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Ocera |   Company











































Focused on rare diseases and their ripple effects.







OCR-002 has been granted Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track status by the FDA for the treatment of hyperammonemia and resultant hepatic encephalopathy in patients with acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver disease.




Overview
Ocera Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OCRX) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for orphan and other serious growing liver diseases with high unmet medical need.
Ocera’s lead drug prorgam is OCR-002, a novel and validated ammonia scavenger which rapidly removes ammonia from the blood. Elevated ammonia is believed to be one of the primary causes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a neurocognitive disorder associated with serious liver disease. An intravenously-administered form of OCR-002 was the subject of a recently completed Phase 2b trial, STOP-HE, in patients hospitalized with HE, and an oral form of the study drug is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a trial in patients with cirrhosis. OCR-002 has received Orphan Drug designation and has been granted Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. See OCR-002 for additional information.
Products to Treat Acute and Chronic Orphan and Other Serious Growing Liver Diseases
Ocera’s drug candidate OCR-002 (ornithine phenylacetate) is a validated ammonia scavenger, designed to treat hyperammonemia (elevated ammonia in the blood) and associated hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of patients with liver cirrhosis or acute liver failure. When the liver is no longer able to remove toxic substances from the blood, there is an accumulation of such toxins, particularly ammonia. Ammonia accumulation in the blood impairs brain cell function, and can lead to a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy, or HE.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
