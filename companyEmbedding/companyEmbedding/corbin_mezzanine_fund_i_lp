To maximize useable floor space, our equipment support platforms are designed to fit around any existing obstructions and can accommodate stairways and access locations as needed.

FCP Free-Space Mezzanines™ will bring your industrial or commercial work space to a whole new level!



Our steel mezzanines can economically transform your unused and unproductive overhead air space into valuable floor space that works for you.  Go ahead – create a second, third or fourth level because our mezzanine systems are fully engineered for superior strength, stability and function. In addition, our easy to install modular mezzanine design easily bolts together to allow for rapid installation, future expansion or even relocation.
Free-Space Mezzanines™ aren’t just for storage! Our rigid frame design is perfect for metal buildings, conveyor support, equipment platforms, in-plant offices, manufacturing activities, walkways or stair tower. Whatever you may need to support above floor level, FCP can create the right structure. Plus, with our design and use of lightweight, high-tensile materials, we are able to install the new structure over existing equipment or stored items with a minimum of support columns thereby maximizing the usable floor space under the mezzanine.
FCP Free-Space Mezzanines™ are designed to comply with all applicable building codes: UBC, CBC and IBC; as well as meeting the rigorous specifications demanded in seismically active zones.
