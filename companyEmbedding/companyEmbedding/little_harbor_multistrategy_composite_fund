Applicants' Representations
1. The MSC Fund is a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The MSC Fund's investment objective is to realize long-term, risk-adjusted returns that are attractive as compared to those returns of traditional public equity and fixed-income markets. The MSC Fund may invest in U.S. and non-U.S. equities of companies with any market capitalization, fixed income securities of any quality, currencies, derivative instruments, futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and commodities.
2. The Investment Manager is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Investment Manager serves as the investment manager to the MSC Fund. Foreside Financial Services, LLC, a broker registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) currently serves as the principal underwriter of the MSC Fund (“Distributor”). In the future, the Distributor may be an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Investment Manager.
3. Applicants seek an order to permit the MSC Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares, with varying sales charges, and/or asset-based distribution and/or service fees, and Deferred Sales Charges.
4. Applicants request that the order also apply to any continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Investment Manager or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Manager, or any successor in interest to such entity,[1] 
           serves as investment adviser and which either operates as an “interval fund” pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act (each, an “Interval Fund”) or provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act (each, a “New Fund,” and together with the MSC Fund, the “Funds”).[2] 

5. Since February 1, 2015, the MSC Fund has made a continuous public offering of its single, undesignated class of Shares (the “Initial Class”).[3] 
           Shares of the MSC Fund currently are not offered or traded in a secondary market and are not listed on any securities exchange or quoted on any quotation medium. Applicants do not expect there to be a secondary trading market for any Fund Shares.
6. The MSC Fund anticipates that Initial Class Shares will continue to be offered at net asset value, subject to a front-end sales load in addition to the current service fee. The MSC Fund and each New Fund propose to offer at least two, and perhaps more than two, classes of Shares. Shares of each new class will be offered at net asset value, and may be subject to a front-end sales load or a Deferred Sales Charge, and/or an asset-based distribution and/or service fee, and/or any early repurchase fee (“Early Repurchase Fee”).[4] 
           Because of the different distribution fees, shareholder service fees, and any other class expenses that may be attributable to the different classes, the net income attributable to, and any dividends payable on, each class of Shares may differ from each other from time to time. As a result, the net asset value per Share of the classes may differ over time.
7. Applicants state that, from time to time, a Fund may create and offer additional classes of Shares of the Fund, or may vary the characteristics of its Shares in the following respects: (i) The amount of fees permitted by a Distribution Plan [5] 
           and/or service plan as to such class; (ii) voting rights with respect to a Distribution Plan and/or service plan as to such class; (iii) different class designations; (iv) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a particular class of Shares allocated on a class basis as described in the application; (v) differences in any dividends and net asset values per Share resulting from differences in fees under a Distribution Plan and/or service plan or in class expenses; (vi) any sales load structure; and (vii) any conversion features, as permitted under the Act.
10. Each Fund and its Distributor will comply with any requirements that the Commission or FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales charges and revenue sharing arrangements, as if those requirements applied to the Fund and the Distributor. In addition, each Fund or its Distributor will contractually require that any other distributor of the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of Shares of the New Fund.
11. Each Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among its various classes of Shares based on the respective net assets of the Fund attributable to each such class, except Start Printed Page 46374that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect the fees associated with the Distribution Plan of that class (if any), shareholder service fees attributable to a particular class (including transfer agency fees, if any), and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of a Fund, respectively allocated to a particular class of the Fund's Shares, will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
12. Applicants state that the Interval Funds may impose Deferred Sales Charges on Shares submitted for repurchase that have been held less than a specified period and may waive the Deferred Sales Charge for certain categories of shareholders or transactions to be established from time to time. Applicants represent that each Interval Fund would apply the Deferred Sales Charge (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the Deferred Sales Charge) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Interval Fund were an open-end investment company.
13. Each Interval Fund may offer its shareholders an exchange feature under which the shareholders of the Interval Fund may, in connection with such Interval Fund's repurchase offers, exchange their Shares of the Interval Fund for Shares of the same class of (i) registered open-end investment companies or (ii) other Funds that continuously offer their Shares at net asset value, and that in either case are in the Interval Fund's group of investment companies (collectively, “Other Funds”). Shares of an Interval Fund that are exchanged for Shares of Other Funds will be included as part of the amount of the repurchase offer amount for such Interval Fund as specified in rule 23c-3 under the Act. Any exchange option will comply with rule 11a-1, 11a-3 and rule 18f-3 under the Act, as if the Interval Fund were an open-end investment company. In complying with rule 11a-3, each Interval Fund will treat any Deferred Sales Charge as if it were a contingent deferred sales charge (“CDSC”).
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Shares of the Funds may be prohibited by section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of Shares of the Funds may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of Shares.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit a Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder services. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
Deferred Sales Charge
1. Section 23(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that no registered closed-end investment company will purchase securities of which it is the issuer, except: (a) On a securities exchange or other open market; (b) pursuant to tenders, after reasonable opportunity to submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be purchased; or (c) under such other circumstances as the Commission may permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of investors.
2. Rule 23c-3 under the Act permits a registered closed-end investment company (an “interval fund”) to make repurchase offers of between five and twenty-five percent of its outstanding shares at net asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of the interval fund. Rule 23c-3(b)(1) under the Act provides that an interval fund may deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee, not to exceed two percent of the proceeds, that is paid to the interval fund and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly related to the repurchase.
3. Section 23(c)(3) provides that the Commission may issue an order that would permit a closed-end investment company to repurchase its shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased.
4. Applicants request relief under sections 6(c), discussed above, and 23(c)(3) from rule 23c-3 to the extent necessary for the Interval Funds to impose a Deferred Sales Charge on Shares submitted for repurchase that have been held for less than a specified period.
5. Applicants state that the Deferred Sales Charge they intend to impose is functionally similar to a CDSC imposed by an open-end investment company under rule 6c-10 under the Act. Rule 6c-10 permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants note that rule 6c-10 is grounded in policy considerations supporting the employment of CDSCs where there are adequate safeguards for the investor and state that the same policy considerations support imposition of Deferred Sales Charges in the interval fund context. In addition, applicants state that Deferred Sales Charges may be necessary for the distributor to recover distribution costs. Applicants represent that any Deferred Sales Charge imposed by the Interval Funds will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if that rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. Each Interval Fund will disclose Deferred Sales Charges in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs. Applicants further state that each Interval Fund will apply the Deferred Sales Charge (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the Deferred Start Printed Page 46375Sales Charge) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution of its Shares through asset-based distribution fees.
3. For the reasons stated above, applicants submit that the exemptions requested under section 6(c) are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants further submit that the relief requested pursuant to section 23(c)(3) is consistent with the protection of investors and insures that applicants do not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased. Finally, applicants submit that the requested relief meets the standards for relief in section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder. Applicants state that the Funds' imposition of asset-based distribution fees is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and does not involve participation on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with the NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

To the extent the Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled variations of, or eliminate any Early Repurchase Fee, it will do so consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act and the Fund's waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of, any such Early Repurchase Fee will apply uniformly to all shareholders of the Fund.

5.
     Distribution fees with respect to any class of Shares of a Fund would be paid pursuant to a plan of distribution adopted by the Fund with respect to the applicable class in compliance with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the Act, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies (a “Distribution Plan”).

Composites
The Composite structure used by Little Harbor has its origin in 2007, the year prior to the financial crisis, when institutional investors had begun to feel the potential vulnerabilities of their fund-of-hedge-fund investments, which included growing correlations to equity markets, layered management fees, incentive fee netting risk and lack of holdings transparency. The Composite structure was developed in response to the flaws Little Harbor saw in the fund-of-funds model that were laid bare in the wake of 2008. Seeking to solve for these problems, the Composite structure offers a clear investment theme, the elimination of layered management fees, a netted incentive fee based on the return of the aggregate portfolio (not on the individual returns of the underlying strategies), holdings transparency for Little Harbor, and an additional level of risk oversight.
Composites are organized with an investment and diversification proposition constructed from a limited and carefully selected cohort of complementary managers. By building a specific investment thesis with dedicated independent managers, Little Harbor Composites avoid over-diversification (which may take place in the typical fund-of-hedge-fund structure) and maintain the independent discretion of the return-drivers in a particular portfolio (unlike most multi-strategy complexes). We believe both advantages sustain the long-term viability, clarity, and verification of a Composite’s value proposition to its investors. Also, by committing to an investment thesis, we believe Composites also have a select group of managers whose profiles include a well-defined single-strategy focus (alpha edge), natural capacity constraints typically associated with such focus, established track records, demonstrated risk management, and significant principal capital invested in their own strategy.
Little Harbor Composites are positioned for both institutional and qualified individual high-net-worth investors who are seeking portal-like access to mid-sized hedge fund managers in a single investment with a single layer of management fees and performance fee-netting across the underlying sub-strategies. Little Harbor does not interfere with the independent investment programs of the Composite’s underlying managers and usually allocates assets in equal percentages between managers in the Composite, rebalanced on at least a quarterly basis. This eliminates the central actor risk arising from market calls by an individual or committee that may adjust asset allocations on an ad-hoc basis.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
