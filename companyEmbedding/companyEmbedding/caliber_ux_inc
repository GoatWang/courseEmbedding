Caliber Ux Personas



          by Andy Stone




            for Emerson Stone



          on Jun 11, 2015


















Oh man, I haven't been active on Dribbble in quite some time. This year has been really busy as we've started up with Emerson Stone. Excited to start posting more in the near future. 
This project is for building and collaborating on UX/CX Personas—we're going to allow you to embed the personas around the web and in any other products that you engineering, sales, or design teams use. Really excited about this one. 
You can sign up to be notified once we launch, and you'll also receive an 8-week course on best-practices in UX research. http://caliberux.com/

CaliberMind Master Subscription Agreement










CaliberMind Master Subscription Agreement
This Master Subscription Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Caliber UX Inc. (doing business as CaliberMind) (“Caliber”) and the Customer identified in the associated Order Form (“Customer”).  The “Effective Date” of this Agreement is the date of the mutually agreed upon order form into which this Agreement is incorporated by reference (“Order Form”).  The parties agree as follows:
The Online Service.
Access and Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Caliber will make the Online Service available to Customer and Customer’s employees, consultants, contractors, and agents authorized by Customer (“Users”). Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Caliber hereby grants the Customer a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use the Online Service by the number of Users or for the number of contacts in Customer’s marketing automation system (as applicable and identified in the associated Order Form), in either case, for which Customer has paid applicable fees, in each case during the Subscription Term (defined below), solely for Customer’s internal business purposes (the “Subscription”). Customer’s Subscription is not dependent on any future functionality or features (or any public comments or other disclosure made by Caliber with respect thereto). “Online Service” means the online, website application provided by Caliber via http://app.caliberux.com or at such other designated URL as Caliber may assign from time to time (including all components thereof, on an individual and collective basis). Customer will remain fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of such Users and will cause such Users to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.
Subscription Term. Customer’s initial subscription term for the Online Service commences on the date stated in the Order Form, or, if later or if none is provided in the Order Form, the day User login names and a password are issued to Customer to access the Online Service under the Order Form (the “Subscription Start Date”). The Subscription will continue for the period specified in the Order Form (the “Initial Subscription Term”), and will automatically extend for successive 1 year periods (each, a “Renewal Term”) at Caliber’s then-current rates, unless either party gives the other party written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Subscription Term or the Renewal Term then in effect. The Initial Subscription Term plus all Renewal Terms are referred to herein as the “Subscription Term”.
Customer Affiliates.  Customer’s Affiliate’s may purchase Subscriptions to the Online Service under separate Order Forms, provided that if any Affiliates are granted any right to access or use the Online Service hereunder, Customer will remain fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of such Affiliates and will cause such Affiliates to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. “Affiliate” means, with respect to a party, any entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party, wherein “control”, for purposes of this definition, means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 50% of the voting interests of such party.
Third Party Services. Customer acknowledges and agrees that in order to provide certain features and functionalities offered by or through the Online Service to Customer (e.g., Content Scoring), Customer must allow the Online Service brief but periodic access to Customer’s account(s) with other third party service providers to retrieve, manipulate, process, and modify (collectively and individually, “Process”) data, and you expressly consent to the Online Service’s accessing those accounts to Process that data solely as is necessary to provide the  Online Service.  If the Online Service cannot for any reason access your third party accounts or Process that data, Caliber may not be able to provide Customer those features or functionalities, and Caliber will be excused from any nonperformance of Online Service. Certain features and functionalities of the Online Service (e.g., Content Scoring) require interaction with Customer’s other third-party service providers, for instance, through APIs belonging to those third parties.  Customer consents to Caliber interacting with Customer’s other third party service provider accounts  solely to provide Customer requested features and functionality, and Customer acknowledges that Caliber is not responsible or liable for the accuracy, content, appropriateness, or completeness of data or content Caliber receives from those third parties.
Additional Services.  Caliber will provide the implementation, configuration, training, or other professional services described in the Order Form (if any) in consideration for the associated fees described in the Order Form in accordance with the terms and conditions in Appendix B. 
Service Levels.  Caliber’s service levels are set forth in Appendix A.
Customer Conduct and Use.
Compliance. Customer is responsible and liable for (i) all activities that occur with respect to the Customer and User accounts, (ii) its and its Users’ use of the Online Service and compliance with this Agreement, and (iii) all Customer Content, communications, and other data uploaded to, stored on, or made accessible by Customer or its Users through the Online Service. Customer and its Users will comply with all applicable laws in connection with the use of the Online Service. In the course of performing its obligations under this Agreement, Caliber will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
Restrictions. Customer and its Users will use the Online Service in accordance with Caliber’s documentation and this Agreement and will not:
tamper with or circumvent the security of the Online Service or access accounts or data not associated with Customer;
attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Online Service, breach the security or authentication measures of the Online Service or attempt to render any part of the Online Service unusable;
distribute, license, sell or otherwise commercially exploit the Online Service for the benefit of a third party, or make the Online Service (including any evaluation version) available to a third party other than as contemplated in this Agreement;
use or access the Online Service to develop a product or service that is competitive with Caliber’s products or services or otherwise copy any ideas, features, functions or graphics of the Online Service;
reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate or seek to obtain the source code of the Online Service, or modify or create a derivative work of the Online Service or any related documentation;
remove or obscure any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the Online Service or related documentation;
disclose (whether orally or in writing) information or analysis regarding the specifications or performance of the Online Service (including benchmark tests).
Suspension. In the event that Customer’s or any of its Users’ use of the Online Service has an adverse impact on either (i) the security of the Online Service, or (ii) another Caliber client’s access or use of the Online Service, then, in either case, Caliber may immediately suspend Customer’s access to the Online Service until the adverse impact ceases.
Confidentiality
Scope. “Confidential Information” means all information of a party (“Disclosing Party“) disclosed or made available to the other party (“Receiving Party“) that is designated in writing or identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. The terms and conditions of the Order Form are Confidential Information of Caliber.
Restrictions. The Receiving Party will: (i) not use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than exercising its rights or performing obligations under this Agreement; (ii) not disclose such Confidential Information to any person or entity, other than its (a) employees who have a “need to know” for the Receiving Party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder and (b) professional advisers, and actual or prospective investors, provided that such employees, investors, acquirers and professional advisers are bound by agreements or, in the case of professional advisers, ethical duties respecting such Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this Section 3; and (iii) use reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information.
Exceptions. If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or court order to make any disclosure of such Confidential Information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, it will first give written notice of such requirement to the Disclosing Party, and permit the Disclosing Party to intervene in any relevant proceedings to protect its interests in its Confidential Information, and provide full cooperation to the Disclosing Party in seeking to obtain such protection. Further, this Section 3 will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt; (ii) is or has become public knowledge or publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
Equitable Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information could cause substantial harm to the Disclosing Party for which damages alone might not be a sufficient remedy and, therefore, that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law or equity.
Fees; Interest; Taxes. Customer will pay to Caliber all of the fees specified in an Order Form, in United States currency, unless otherwise specified in the Order Form. Except as expressly set forth to the contrary in the Agreement, all payment obligations are non-cancellable and all amounts paid Caliber are non-refundable. Fees will be invoiced in advance in accordance with the terms of the Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, all fees are due within 30 days from the invoice date. Unpaid invoices are subject to a late payment charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all reasonable expenses and fees of collection. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any sales, use and other taxes or duties, however designated (collectively “Taxes”). Customer will be solely responsible for payment of all Taxes, except for those taxes based on the income of Caliber. Customer will not withhold any Taxes from any amounts due Caliber. If Caliber pays any such taxes on behalf of Customer, Customer will reimburse Caliber for such payments.
Proprietary Rights. This Agreement is not an agreement for the sale or license of any software or other intellectual property right. Customer acknowledges that the Online Service contains copyrighted and proprietary products and materials. Caliber and Caliber’s licensors solely and exclusively retain all right, title and interest in and to the Online Service and related support, documentation and professional services deliverables, and all related and underlying software, interfaces, databases, data models, structures, non-Customer-specific data, aggregated statistical data, technology, reports and other intellectual property, plus all intellectual and other proprietary rights therein or thereto, but excluding Customer Content(all of the foregoing, the “Caliber IP”). Except for the Subscription granted hereunder, Customer has no right, title or interest in, and Caliber reserves all rights to, the Caliber IP.
Termination.
Term and Termination. This Agreement will be effective during the Subscription Term, unless earlier terminated as allowed in the Agreement. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, this Agreement may only be terminated: (i) by a party upon written notice to the other party (A) if the other party breaches a material term of this Agreement that is uncured within 30 days after receipt of notice of such breach; (B) if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (C) immediately in the event of a material breach by the other party of Section 2 of this Agreement; (ii) as expressly allowed elsewhere in the Agreement.
Outstanding Fees; Refund. Customer will pay all fees owed to Caliber that have accrued up until the effective date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with the Agreement. If Customer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 6(a)(i), Caliber will refund Customer a prorated amount equal to the pre-paid Subscription Fees covering the whole months that would have remained, absent such early termination, in Customer’s Subscription Term following the effective date of such early termination.
Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, the Subscription shall immediately terminate and Customer will immediately cease all use of and access to the Online Service and delete (or, at Caliber’s request, return) all related documentation, passwords and access codes and any other Caliber Confidential Information in its possession. Caliber will have no liability for any suspension or termination of Customer’s access to the Online Service, or any termination of this Agreement, provided that it is conducted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon written request by Customer made within 30 days after termination, Caliber will provide Customer with temporary access to the Online Service solely for Customer to retrieve its Customer Content, but not any other purpose.  After such 30-day period, Caliber will have no obligation to maintain or provide access to Customer Content and will thereafter, unless legally prohibited and except for archival backup purposes, have the right to delete all Customer Content in its possession or control. Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
Warranties.
Corporate Authority. Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that the Order Form is executed by an employee or agent of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Functionality Warranty. Caliber warrants that during the Subscription Term, the Online Service will operate in substantial conformity with the then current version of the applicable documentation provided by Caliber. As its sole obligation and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the foregoing warranty, Caliber shall use reasonable efforts to correct any error in the operation of the Online Service of which Customer notifies Caliber with 30 days after the occurrence of such breach and, if Caliber cannot correct such error, then Customer may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice to Caliber.
Security Warranty. Caliber has implemented and during the Subscription Term will implement Appropriate Security Measures (as hereinafter defined) and maintains the Online Service at reputable third party Internet service providers and co-location facilities. “Appropriate Security Measures” means commercially reasonable physical, technical, and procedural efforts to protect Customer Content against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure to third parties or unauthorized access by employees or contractors employed by Caliber.
Customer. Customer represents and warrants that it has the right to use the Customer Content as contemplated by this Agreement, and/or allow Caliber to possess and use the Customer Content as is necessary to provide services to Customer under this Agreement.
Disclaimer. EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 7 OR APPENDIX B (IF APPLICABLE), (I) THE ONLINE SERVICE, SUBSCRIPTION AND ALL OTHER CALIBER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND (II) CALIBER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE, IN EACH CASE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION ARE SOLELY TO AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF CUSTOMER AND NO OTHER THIRD PARTY. CALIBER WILL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELIVERY OR SERVICE FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE INTERNET, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR ANY OTHER SYSTEMS.
Limitations of Liability.

Mutual Indemnification.
 Caliber Indemnification. Caliber will defend Customer and its Affiliates (“Customer Indemnitees”) against claims, demands, suits or proceedings, in each of the foregoing cases that is made or brought by a third party against a Customer Indemnitee alleging that the Online Service as delivered infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party (“Customer Claim”) and Caliber will indemnify and hold the Customer Indemnitees harmless from and against any loss, liability, damage or cost (including reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees) (“Losses”) attributable to such Customer Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Caliber reasonably believes that the Online Service or Customer’s use of any portion of the Online Service is likely to be enjoined by reason of a Customer Claim or other violation or misappropriation of any third party intellectual property rights, then Caliber may, at its expense and in its sole discretion: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Online Service; or (ii) replace or modify the applicable software, services or other material so that there is no longer any infringement, violation or misappropriation, provided that such replacement or modification does not adversely affect the functional capabilities of the Online Service. If, in Caliber’s opinion, (i) and (ii) above are commercially impracticable, Caliber may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement and refund Customer a prorated amount equal to the pre-paid Subscription Fees covering the whole months that would have remained, absent such early termination, in Customer’s Subscription Term following the effective date of such early termination. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Caliber will not apply: (1) if the Online Service is modified by any party other than Caliber, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) if the Online Service is combined with other non-Caliber products, applications, or processes not authorized by Caliber, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the Online Service; (4) to any third party deliverables or components contained within the Online Service that are not provided by Caliber; or (5) to the extent the claim is based on infringement by Customer Content. THIS SECTION 9(a) SETS FORTH CALIBER’S SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.
Customer Indemnification. Customer will defend Caliber and its Affiliates (“Caliber Indemnitees”) against claims, demands, suits or proceedings made or brought by a third party against a Caliber Indemnitee to the extent it is based on, arising from, or related to (i) Customer’s communications with any third party through the Online Service, or (ii) Customer Content (as delivered by Customer) (collectively, a “Caliber Claim”) and Customer will indemnify and hold the Caliber Indemnitees harmless from and against any Losses attributable to such Caliber Claim.
Procedure. Each party’s indemnity obligations are subject to the following: (i) the aggrieved party will promptly notify the indemnifier in writing of the Claim; (ii) the indemnifier will have sole responsibility for and control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations with respect to the Claim (provided that the indemnifier may not settle or defend any Claim unless it unconditionally releases the aggrieved party of all liability); and (iii) the aggrieved party will cooperate fully to the extent necessary, and execute all documents necessary for the defense of such Claim.
General Provisions.
Relationship of Customer and Caliber. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.
Modifications and Waiver. No modification of, amendment or addition to this Agreement is valid or binding unless set forth in writing and fully executed by both parties hereto. Any waiver of any right or remedy under this Agreement must be in writing and signed by each party. No delay in exercising any right or remedy will operate as a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion will not be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.
Assignment. This Agreement and any rights or obligations hereunder may not be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise transferred by the parties without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party, except that either party may assign or transfer this Agreement (i) to any of its Affiliates, or (b) upon a change of control of a party, a sale of all or substantially all assets of that party, or by operation of law, in each case, by providing the non-assigning party with prior written notice thereof provided that the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Governing Law. This Agreement and any claim, controversy, right, obligation, or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement, the relationship of the parties, and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights, performance obligations, and duties of the parties will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Colorado USA, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts in Denver County and the federal courts in the City of Denver, USA. The parties waive any right to jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this Agreement.
Notices. Any notices under this Agreement will be in writing and sent via certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight courier service. Notices to Caliber will be sent to the address for Caliber set forth in the Order Form and addressed to the General Counsel. Notices to Customer will be sent to the address for Customer set forth in the Order Form and addressed to Customer’s signatory unless otherwise designated by Customer.
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable, or will be severed from this Agreement, and all other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
Counterparts/Electronic Signatures. This Agreement will be deemed executed upon mutual execution of the Order Form, which may be executed and delivered by email, and upon receipt such transmission will be deemed delivery of an original, and which may be executed in several counterparts each of which when executed will be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts will each constitute one and the same instrument. The parties consent to electronic signatures for the purpose of executing this Agreement by e-mail or other electronic means, subject to compliance with any applicable laws, rules or regulations. Any such documents that are delivered electronically and accepted are deemed to be “in writing” to the same extent and with the same effect as if the Agreement had been signed manually. In no event will electronic execution expand such assent to include any terms other than those explicitly set forth in this Agreement.
Force Majeure. Neither party to this Agreement will be liable to the other for any failure or delay in performance by circumstances beyond its control, including but not limited to, acts of God, fire, labor difficulties, governmental action or terrorism, provided that the party seeking to rely on such circumstances gives written notice of such circumstances to the other party hereto and uses reasonable efforts to overcome such circumstances.
Subcontractors. Caliber may use the services of subcontractors for the provision of any Online Service and performance of any services under this Agreement; provided, however, Caliber will be responsible for each subcontractor’s performance of services under this Agreement and for each subcontractor’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Entire Agreement; Interpretation. This Agreement consists of the Agreement and all Order Forms referencing this Agreement, all of which are incorporated by this reference,   and constitutes the entire agreement and sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to Customer’s Subscription to the Online Service described in the Order Form, and supersedes all prior agreements and discussions with respect thereto, including Caliber’s online Terms of Service. In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Order Form, the terms of the Order Form will govern. Caliber hereby rejects any different or additional terms of a Customer purchase order or other non-Caliber ordering document, and no terms included in any Customer purchase order or other non-Caliber ordering document will apply to the Customer’s Subscription or use of the Online Service. Headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not in any way define or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. For purposes hereof, “including” means “including without limitation”. 




By signing below, each party agrees to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement.

Appendix B
Professional Services Terms
Capitalized terms set forth in this Appendix but not defined in the Appendix have the meaning given elsewhere in the Agreement.
Statements of Work.  All services to be performed under an Order Form shall be described in either an Order Form or a separate written, mutually agreed to, SOW signed by authorized representatives of both parties (each a “SOW”), each of which is expressly made subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Customer agrees to retain Caliber to perform the consulting services described in each SOW (the “Services“), and Caliber agrees to perform the Services on the terms and subject to the conditions and assumptions set forth in this Agreement.  Statements of Work should contain descriptions of the Services and a description of any deliverables to be provided by Caliber, Caliber’s compensation, and any additional terms and conditions the parties deem appropriate. Customer and Caliber expressly acknowledge and agree that any schedules or timelines shall not be considered firm or fixed performance dates, are only to be regarded as estimated beginning and completion dates for the tasks and activities to be performed hereunder and are expected to be revised during the term of any engagement.  Caliber agrees to use diligent efforts to meet schedules. Customer acknowledges that Caliber limits the amount of time Caliber’s personnel spend on out of town travel, and such limits may impact the weekly schedules of a particular engagement. All Services and Deliverables are accepted upon delivery.
Changes.  Each party may request changes that affect the scope or duration of the Services relating to any SOW.  Neither party shall be bound by any change requested by the other party, until such change has been memorialized in writing and signed (or otherwise agreed to in writing, including e-mail) by authorized representatives of each party (“Change Order”).  Each Change Order will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Location and Access.  Caliber may perform the Services at Customer’s premises, Caliber’s premises or such other premises that Customer and Caliber may deem appropriate.   The SOW may describe the location where Caliber will perform Services. Customer will permit Caliber to have reasonable access to Customer’s premises, personnel and computer equipment for the purposes of performing the Services at Customer’s premises.
Customer Assistance. Customer shall provide Caliber with such resources, information, cooperation, and assistance as Caliber may reasonably request in connection with the performance of the Services.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event the Services are provided on Customer’s premises, Customer shall provide safe and adequate space, power, network connections, and other resources as reasonably requested by Caliber, whether requested during regular business hours or otherwise.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that Caliber’s ability to successfully perform the Services in a timely manner is contingent upon its receipt from Customer of the information, resources and assistance requested.  Caliber shall have no liability for deficiencies in the Services or Deliverables, or failure to meet any Schedule, resulting from the acts or omissions of Customer, its agents or employees or performance of the Services in accordance with Customer’s instructions. 
Customer Information. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Caliber may, in performing its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, be dependent upon or use data, material, and other information furnished by Customer without any independent investigation or verification thereof, and that Caliber shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy and completeness of such information in performing the Services.  Caliber, in performing the Services, will be making recommendations and providing advice, but all decisions as to implementing such advice and recommendations shall be made by and shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer and Caliber shall be entitled to rely on all such decisions of Customer.
Ownership.  “Caliber Reserved Technology” means any ideas, concepts, know-how, knowledge, techniques, tools, approaches, methodologies, templates, operating instructions, standardized features, other technology, or any intellectual property rights created, developed, owned or licensed by Caliber (i) prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement or (ii) during the term of this Agreement but outside the scope of this Agreement and any SOW or (iii) during the term of this Agreement that are generally applicable and not Customer-specific.  Other than Caliber Reserved Technology, all work product that Caliber creates specifically for Customer under any SOW (the “Deliverables”), all patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other proprietary rights in or to the Deliverables are and will be the sole and exclusive property of Customer, and Caliber hereby assigns ownership of Deliverables to Customer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Caliber shall own all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property rights embodied in the Caliber Reserved Technology, whether or not such Caliber Reserved Technology is incorporated into any Customer Deliverables.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Caliber from creating derivative works based on the Caliber Reserved Technology, developing, modifying, using, marketing, distributing or otherwise commercially exploiting the Caliber Reserved Technology in any manner. Caliber reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer under this Agreement.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting Caliber’s rights to commercially use or market in the conduct of Caliber’s business general ideas, concepts, know-how, knowledge, market analysis, frameworks, techniques, tools, approaches, and methodologies or other residual values possessed or known to Caliber or learned or developed during the course of providing the Services, without obligation of any kind to Customer.
Limited Warranty.  Caliber represents and warrants that Caliber will perform the Services in a good and workmanlike manner.  As Caliber’s sole obligation and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty, Caliber will re-perform any defective services at no additional cost to Customer.

I am writing to give my unconditional appreciation and respect for Mr. Chris B., regarding my recent Deed-in-Lieu request.  Mr. B. treated me with both dignity and respect and assisted me through a very emotional process.  He was very diligent in communicating with me and returning calls.  He demonstrated both exceptional interpersonal skills and work ethic.  In a world where everything is so impersonal and technical, you have a “GEM” in your midst.  Hang onto him.
Harriet D. – DE




Caliber loans made our refinance experience amazing. Look forward to working with them for all our mortgage needs.
Quade S. – CO




Casey and Shay were wonderful, outstanding, helpful and very respectful agents.  My experience with a prior servicer was terrible and I am glad that my loan was transferred to Caliber Home Loans!
Michael A. – IN




Great service! Excellent communications – not just with us the buyers, but with our agent, escrow company and the listing agent.
Douglas C. – WA




I think that all loan companies - big or small - should follow the standards that Caliber set forth when they’re working for the person getting a home loan. I felt confident from day one on getting a loan, so I didn't have to worry.
