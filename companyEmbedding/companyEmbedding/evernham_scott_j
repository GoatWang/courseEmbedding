The Ultimate Chargers begins with upcoming 2006 season.


Englewood Cliffs, N.J. -- Unilever United States today announced the signing of a multi-year agreement with Evernham Motorsports starting with the upcoming 2006 NASCAR Busch Series season. The new program, named the Ultimate Chargers™ will replace the highly successful Hungry Drivers™ program that began during the 2004 NASCAR Busch Series.Under terms of the agreement, Evernham Motorsports' ASCAR Busch Series team will feature an expanded group of Unilever brands, all sharing the sponsorship starting in 2006. Unilever Home and Personal Care Products (HPC) Snuggle® Fabric Softener and Wisk® Laundry Detergent and Unilever food brands Wish-Bone® Salad Dressings and Slim·Fast® weight control products, will join current sponsoring brands Ragu® pasta sauce, Hellmann'® Mayonnaise, Country Crock® chilled sides and meals, Lipton® Tea and Lawry'® Spices and Marinades as the sponsors of the Ultimate Chargers™ team.Lisa Klauser, Unilever Vice President, Brand Building through Customers, US, sees the renewed partnership with Evernham Motorsports as an exciting opportunity to take the already successful Unilever racing program to the next level both on track and off. "This expanded agreement with Evernham Motorsports encompasses our company's One Unilever strategy. It's an ideal opportunity for multiple Unilever brands from different categories to work together to promote our products to the brand loyal NASCAR fan base.""We believe the NASCAR Busch series is the perfect venue to demonstrate to our consumers - many who are also dedicated NASCAR fans - that Unilever is a passionate company that strives everyday to help people to feel good, look good and get more out of life," said Alan Jope, Unilever Group Vice President Home Personal Care, NA. "We are thrilled to add Snuggle and Wisk to the Unilever family of brands who support this highly successful program. It's truly a One Unilever effort and we look forward to much continued success."Fans will see the Evernham family of NEXTEL Cup drivers, including standouts Kasey Kahne, Jeremy Mayfield, and Scott Riggs behind the wheel of the Ultimate Chargers™ No. 9 Dodge Charger. Trip Bruce will remain crew chief of the team. The No. 9 will feature a new primarily red paint scheme featuring the various sponsoring brands. The Ultimate Chargers™ team will race the 23 companion races in the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series.The newly signed agreement designates the Ultimate Chargers™ brand roster as Official Products of Evernham Motorsports. In addition, Ragu®, Hellmann's®, Country Crock®, Lawry’s® and Lipton® will continue to be Proud Sponsors of NASCAR and official products of Daytona International Speedway, Richmond International Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. Ragu®, Hellmann's®, Country Crock ®, and Lawry's ® will continue to be official products of Texas Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Lowe's Motor Speedway.Campground sampling of Unilever food brands will increase at track. Additionally, the Unilever brands will be promoted through retail activation programs, which will feature simulator appearances at various retail outlets across the country. Unilever brands will also have increased marketing rights to use the Evernham Family of Drivers.Mooresville, NC based Bulldawg Marketing will continue as the NASCAR agency of record for Unilever in the United States. Bulldawg will execute retail, trackside and hospitality programs as well as coordinate the sponsorships with NASCAR, various tracks and Evernham Motorsports."We are extremely excited to expand our relationship with Unilever into the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series season," said Ray Evernham, CEO of Evernham Motorsports. "Together, we have successfully built a competitive Busch Series team this season and look forward to continued success in the future."Unilever entered the NASCAR Busch Series at the start of the 2004 season with a first of its kind program, providing up and coming, or "hungry" drivers with the chance to showcase their talent driving for a top-notch team, Tommy Baldwin Racing. Unilever expanded the Hungry Drivers™ program to a full NASCAR Busch Series race season in 2005 with Evernham Motorsports.
