VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF
















Fund Description
VanEck Vectors® Global Alternative Energy ETF (GEX®) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Ardour Global IndexSM Extra Liquid (AGIXLT), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in the business of alternative energy. Alternative energy includes power derived principally from bio-fuels (such as ethanol), bio mass, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal sources, and also includes various technologies that support the production, use and storage of these sources.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding.

VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF
















Fund Description
VanEck Vectors® Global Alternative Energy ETF (GEX®) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Ardour Global IndexSM Extra Liquid (AGIXLT), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in the business of alternative energy. Alternative energy includes power derived principally from bio-fuels (such as ethanol), bio mass, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal sources, and also includes various technologies that support the production, use and storage of these sources.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

HedgeZ Fund Profile
































TPH Energy Infrastructure
Fund LP

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The TPH Energy Infrastructure Fund LP differentiates itself by investing across the energy infrastructure spectrum. The team covers three primary energy sectors (Power & Utilities, Midstream and MLPs, and Energy Infrastructure) and 18 subsectors with a market cap of over $1.5 trillion. We conduct intensive fundamental research to independently value the individual hard assets underlying public energy securities. Pricing inefficiencies are identified based on valuation analysis. We leverage a perpetual feedback loop created by ongoing public filings. Our investment process can be broken down into four main steps: 1) Quantitative Screening (Minimum cap, market, liquidity, geographical focus, sector, sub-sector); 2) Initial Review (Conduct initial analysis, speak with internal/external relationships); 3) Intensive Bottom-Up Analysis (Asset level data, company specific model, P.I.P.E, meet with company management); 4) Implementation and Monitoring (Size, balance holding views, meet objectives, determine exit factors).
While currently long biased, the Fund employs a long-short strategy in order to reduce volatility and protect our returns. Our actively traded portfolio with alpha shorts and proactive hedging reduces energy sector and macro risks. The Fund has shown strong risk-adjusted returns (19.2% in 2013) and low correlation to energy commodities and indices since inception of the strategy in 2009.  

Subscriptions less than $5 million have a Management fee of 2%. Subscriptions greater than $5 million have a management fee of 1.5%

Performance is shown for an unrestricted investor subject to a 1.5% management fee and a 15% performance fee and is net of fees and expenses, and includes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Many factors affect fund performance including changes in market conditions and interest rates and in response to other economic, political, or financial developments. Investment return and principal value of your investment will fluctuate, so that when your investment is sold, the amount you receive could be less than what you originally invested. Past performance is not a guide to or indicative of future results. Future returns are not guaranteed and a loss of principal may occur. Performance history of less than two years may not provide an adequate basis from which to determine the performance of a fund. Accordingly, such a short performance history should not be relied upon. November 2012 and December 2012 offshore investor performance returns were determined by adjusting TPH Energy Infrastructure Fund LP onshore investor performance for 30% dividend tax withholding as there were no offshore investors during this time period.

Fund performance is a preliminary calculation by TPH Asset Management LLC and reflects the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions. Finalized fund performance is calculated by Northern Trust Hedge Services LLC during the month end NAV calculation process. Fund returns may differ from an individual investor's return due to timing of investment, fees, taxes and eligibility to participate in certain investments.

Performance and metrics for offshore investors in the EQ Capital Partners Ltd.'s EQC Fund as adjusted for dividend tax withholding that is applicable only to offshore investors.  Performance and metrics are as of 10/31/2012 for the time period July 2009 to October 2012.  Past returns may not be indicative of or a guarantee of future results. The investment team managed the EQC Fund prior to being employed by TPH Asset Management, LLC. Some of the data included reflects performance and characteristics of the assets of the EQC Fund which was previously managed by Diego Kuschnir prior to being employed by TPH Asset Management, LLC. Such assets were acquired and managed with similar investment objectives to the Fund. Performance information of the EQC Funds is presented net of management fees, performance fees and expenses that would be applicable to that fund's investors, and the reinvestment of dividends. There may be material differences between the Fund and the EQC Fund and their respective investment strategies. Therefore, information from the EQC Fund is included for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

This document is for information purposes only. This is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of any offer to buy any securities in any fund managed by us. Any offering is made only pursuant to the relevant offering document, together with the current financial statements of the relevant fund, if available, and the relevant subscription application, all of which must be read in their entirety. No offer to purchase securities will be made or accepted prior to receipt by the offeree of these documents and the completion of all appropriate documentation. Past performance of a fund is no guarantee as to its performance in the future. This presentation is not an advertisement and is not intended for public use or distribution.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
