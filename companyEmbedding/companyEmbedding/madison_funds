2016 Madison Funds�Tax Information


Madison Funds tax forms were mailed on January 23, 2017. You can view your 2016 tax information by accessing your account via Account Access.� After signing in, you will find the �View Tax� option in the fund-level drop down menu on the �Shareholder Portfolio� page. This option will only display for funds that had taxable events.� Note: The IRS does not require your mutual fund tax form to accompany your tax return.�
Helpful Reminders�

You will not receive a Form 1099-DIV if you have taxable ordinary dividends for any fund totaling $10 or less. You must still include these dividends on your income tax return. The dividends are shown in the "Income and Capital Gains Summary" section of your 2016 year-end investor statement mailed in early January.�
IRS Form 5498 and 5498-ESA (which reports the Fair Market Value of contributions made to qualified-plan retirement accounts and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) through April 17, 2017 for the 2016 tax year) will be mailed to you in May 2017 and April 2017 respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Fair Market Value of these accounts was noted on your year-end investor statement.�
Madison�Funds has prepared tax inserts that may accompany your tax forms:
	
Information for Form 1099-DIV

Distribution of Ordinary Income Dividends

																		Category: Retirement Funds 



					Published: 19 March 2015				




					Hits: 1664			 
Overview
This product is targeted to individuals who would wish to set up their personal pension plans.The product is regulated by the RBA. The product offers an excellent avenue for individuals to:

Consolidate their different pension funds as the change employment;
Set up their own pension plans in cases where the employer does not have any. The employee continues to enjoy the tax benefit for their contribution to the fund;
 Set up a pension fund in addition to that set up by the employer. The individual will enjoy tax benefits on the individual pension plan as long as they have not utilized their maximum deductible amounts in their primary pension plan with the employer.

Features

All in one package: In an individual pension plan, the individual will participate in an all in one package that includes a registered pension fund that has a Trustee, a Custodian, an administrator and a Fund Manager. It is like an off the shelf product that is already registered with Retirement Benefits Scheme and Kenya Revenue Authority.
Registered and Regulated by Retirement benefit Authority: Investment safety is ensured because the individual pension plan is registered by Retirement Benefit authority and strictly regulated in accordance with retirement benefits regulation in Kenya.
Suitable for Self Employed/Employed in Informal sector: The self employed and those in the informal sector can participate in this fund without undergoing the hassle of registering their own retirement Benefit Schemes.

Benefits

Enables one to save funds towards one’s retirement ensuring a decent standard of living.
 Contributions up to Kshs.20,000 are tax deductible; one can contribute up to 30% of their income to registered pension scheme.
  Investment income of the scheme is exempted from corporation tax.
The retirement benefit scheme can now facilitate members to assign up to 60% of their accrued benefits as additional security for mortgages from approved Institutions.
Upon death of a member of a registered scheme, the dependants qualify as a group for tax-exemption.
 The schemes will be run under the RBA act which gives security of the fund and also continuous benefits which the Government may give to schemes from time to time.

						Guaranteed pooled Pension Funds

													Details							

																		Category: Retirement Funds 



					Published: 19 March 2015				




					Hits: 1706			 
Overview
This product pools funds from different small pension schemes to one large fund and also offers a guarantee on the minimum return on the fund. Usually, the client is guaranteed that value of their investment will not fall below the capital contributed and that once a return has been declared at year end and credited to the client’s account; such return is guaranteed and cannot be lost in subsequent years.
Features


Scheme must be registered  For a scheme to be managed on a segregated basis, the employer needs to set up the scheme and register it with the Retirement Benefits Authority and Kenya Revenue Authority. In cases where the employer has not set up their scheme, Madison Asset can assist in this process.

Funds held by a custodianThe funds for the scheme will be held by a custodian bank appointed by the client. The custodian will ensure that funds are invested for the benefit of the scheme and are safe.

Scheme to appoint trusteesOnce registered, the Scheme is considered an independent entity and must appoint trustees who will be responsible for the running of the scheme.

Scheme to appoint administrator or own administratorThe administrator will carry out the day to day administration tasks of the scheme which include, but are not limited to, keeping members records, communicating with members of the scheme, ensuring that the scheme is compliant with Retirement Benefit Authority regulations and other tasks as may be agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme. If the scheme is able, the law allows it to be own administrator.
Must comply with Retirements Benefits authority  regulationsThe Scheme must comply with all regulations of the Retirement Benefit Authority that are generally intended to ensure that the funds are safe. In most cases, the Scheme Administrator and Fund Manager will advise the Trustees accordingly on compliance issues.
Scheme sizeWe generally advise that a Scheme have assets of more than Kshs 50 million to be managed in a segregated basis. Such amount of investment will allow the Scheme to undertake meaningful investment. For smaller schemes, we would advise a guaranteed fund.

Benefits
Benefits of this product include:

A minimum level of return is guaranteed. This is very important for small pension schemes because they can, in turn, guarantee to their members that their contributions will not be lost under any circumstances;
The pension fund is able to participate in investments such as property that they would otherwise not afford on their own; and
The fund manager can diversify the investment by investing in different categories of investment and, therefore, reduce risk while at the same time improving return.
Members who contribute to a registered Scheme will enjoy tax deductions both on contribution to the Scheme and on return on the Scheme investments. They will enjoy further tax breaks when the finally get their benefits from the Scheme.
Madison Asset charges a very competitive fee for the management of Scheme funds.

The Investment Fund
The diversified nature of investment opportunities in the local as well as international market called for the establishment of such an investment vehicle geared towards a wide base of professional investors with varying risk and economic profiles.
Our priority was the common expectation of investors for transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, capital growth, wealth maximization, a clear exit route as well as the distribution of profits in a way that would ensure the most beneficial tax treatment.
In order to meet the above goals, we reached the conclusion that our investment fund should operate under a strictly regulated environment which would meet investor expectations, while allowing investors to choose tailor-made investment portfolios matching their unique individual profiles and expectations.
As the issues above are mainly addressed by the Cyprus registered Alternative Investment Fund with a Limited Number of Persons (“AIFLNP”), we incorporated Madison Funds under its regulatory framework.
