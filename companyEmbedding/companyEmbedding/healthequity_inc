HSAs: the new retirement strategy
Save now and for the future








How an HSA works


An HSA paired with an HSA-qualified health plan allows you to make tax-free contributions to an FDIC-insured savings account. 



HSA-qualified health plans typically cost less than traditional plans and the money saved can be put into your HSA.



HSA balances earn tax-free interest and can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses.

HSAs: The new retirement strategy
The average American couple will need $265,000 to cover out-of-pocket health
care costs in retirement. An HSA can help fill this Medicare gap as well as dental, hearing and vision expenses. Qualified medical expenses remain tax-free, even into retirement. In addition, after age 65, you can use your HSA much like a 401(k) and withdraw funds for any purpose.

This Health Savings Firm Could Skyrocket On TrumpCare
HealthEquity (HQY) is open "every hour every day" — a pledge with which co-founder and Vice Chairman Steve Neeleman is familiar after spending a chunk of his career running a Utah airline. The airline world generally embraces the concept of putting customers first, he says, but health care often treats them like an afterthought. "You couldn't call your health plan after 6 p.m. at night," Neeleman told Investor's Business Daily. "If you called

					Full Description



HealthEquity, Inc., incorporated on October 18, 2002, is a provider of a range of solutions for managing healthcare accounts (Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)) for health plans, insurance companies and third-party administrators. The Company is engaged in technology-enabled services platforms that allow consumers to make healthcare saving and spending decisions. The Company's platform provides an ecosystem where consumers can access their tax-advantaged healthcare savings, compare treatment options and pricing, evaluate and pay healthcare bills, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn wellness incentives and make educated investment choices to help in their tax-advantaged healthcare savings.The Company's products and services include healthcare saving and spending platform, health savings accounts, investment advisory services, reimbursement arrangements and healthcare incentives. Its ecosystem primarily consists of HSA, a financial account through which consumers spend and save long term for healthcare on a tax-advantaged basis. The Company's customers include individuals, employers of all sizes and health plans. The Company's Health Plan Partners and Employer Partners collectively constitute its Network Partners. The Company is an Internal Revenue Services (IRS) approved non-bank custodian of its members' HSAs.Healthcare saving and spending platformThe Company offers a cloud-based platform, accessed by its customers online through a desktop or mobile device, through which individuals can make health saving and spending decisions, pay healthcare bills, compare treatment options and prices, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn wellness incentives, grow their savings and make investment choices. The platform provides users with access to services it provides, as well as services provided by third parties selected by it or by its Network Partners. Among other features, the platform includes the capability to present to users medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details, such as the amount paid by insurance, specific nature of the medical service provided and diagnostic code. Users of the platform can pay these bills from an account of the Company's or from any bank account, online, through a mobile device, or using its payment card. All users of the platform gain access to its healthcare consumer specialists, available every hour of every day, through a toll-free telephone number or e-mail.Health savings accountsAn HSA is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account managed by a trustee that is a bank, an insurance company, or a non-bank custodian specifically authorized by the United States Department of the Treasury as meeting certain ownership, capitalization and governance requirements.Investment advisory servicesThe Company offers an online-only investment advisory service to all of its members. This service is entirely elective to the member. The advisory services are delivered through a Web-based tool, HealthEquity Advisor, which is offered and managed by its investment advisor subsidiary, HealthEquity Advisors, LLC. HealthEquity Advisors, LLC provides investment advice to its clients through the HealthEquity Advisor tool on the Website. HealthEquity Advisor provides guidance and management, including how much cash (liquidity) to maintain in an HSA and how to diversify optimally among available mutual funds. The Company offers over three levels of service to investors: Self-driven, in which the Company provides mutual fund investment platform to invest HSA balances; GPS, in which HealthEquity Advisor provides guidance and advice, but the member makes the final investment decisions, and Auto-pilot, in which HealthEquity Advisor manages the account and implements portfolio allocation and investment advice automatically for the members.Reimbursement arrangementsReimbursement arrangements (RAs) include HRAs and FSAs. The Company administers HSAs and HRAs on its technology platform. An HRA is administered by any third-party administration (TPA) firm. RAs are employee benefits wherein an employer provides a fixed dollar amount of reimbursement for qualified medical or dependent care expenses. Payments must be substantiated with electronic claims from a health plan, data gleaned from operation of its payment card where permitted or submission of receipts or other documentation by the employee. RAs have the tax benefit that, similar to HSAs, their value may be excluded from employees' gross income for federal and state income and employment tax purposes. RAs are not portable, any remaining value is lost upon termination of employment, but is subject to COBRA requirements. An HRA must be paid for entirely by the employer with no salary reduction, is integrated with a medical plan and allows unused benefits to be rolled over from year to year. An FSA is paid for entirely through salary reduction from the employee, is a stand-alone, voluntary offering and is subject to use or lose restrictions.Healthcare incentivesThe Company allows its Employer Partners and Health Plan Partners to offer and its members to earn, financial incentives for participation in wellness programs. Its technology platform includes a financial incentives framework and integration with various wellness providers used by its Network Partners. Once earned, incentives may be deposited directly into an HSA, RA or cash account, with Network Partner-specific messaging. Its platform routes incentives to the right type of account to maintain tax compliance, including creating and routing funds to an RA where an HSA Member is ineligible to receive HSA contributions due to disqualifying coverage.The Company competes with Webster Bank, Optum Bank, Wells Fargo Bank and Payflex Systems USA, Inc.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/08/2016
            

                BBB has determined that HealthEquity, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        HealthEquity, Inc. has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 16 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
