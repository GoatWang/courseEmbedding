            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

It has design centers in Irvine, California; Santa Rosa, California; Newbury Park; Woburn; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Cedar Rapids, Iowa.[3] According to its website, the company has design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service facilities throughout North America, Europe, Japan and Asia.[3]
The music video for The Postal Service's song "Such Great Heights" is set in Skyworks' Newbury Park chip fabrication plant.[4]
On October 5, 2015, Skyworks Solutions entered a definitive agreement to acquire PMC-Sierra for $2 billion in cash.[5] However, Skyworks walked away from the deal, having been outbid by Microsemi.

History[edit]
The company formed as a result of a merger of Alpha Industries and the wireless communications division of Conexant, which took effect on June 26, 2002.[2] Headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts, Skyworks has manufacturing facilities in Woburn, Newbury Park, California and Mexicali, Mexico. It has design centers in Irvine, California; Santa Rosa, California; Newbury Park; Woburn; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Cedar Rapids, Iowa.[3] According to its website, the company has design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service facilities throughout North America, Europe, Japan and Asia.[3]
The music video for The Postal Service's song "Such Great Heights" is set in Skyworks' Newbury Park chip fabrication plant.[4]
On October 5, 2015, Skyworks Solutions entered a definitive agreement to acquire PMC-Sierra for $2 billion in cash.[5] However, Skyworks walked away from the deal, having been outbid by Microsemi.

3 Things Skyworks Solutions Inc. Had to Say About Apple Inc.
This Apple supplier offered some interesting insights into the impact that the ramp-up of the next iPhone will have on its business.

            Jul 24, 2017 at 8:45AM
            
            





Although Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has done a good job broadening its customer base beyond Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the fact is that Apple continues to be the wireless chip supplier's largest customer. That means sales of Apple products, and Skyworks' share within Apple's key products, both affect Skyworks' financial performance.
Those who follow the company, then, should keep close tabs on what Skyworks says about its relationship with Apple.

Here are three items pertaining to that relationship from the company's most recent earnings call. 
The iPhone ramp-up
When analyst Blayne Curtis asked Skyworks CEO Liam K. Griffin about a possible delay in the ramp-up in chip shipments to Apple in support of the next iPhone because of the rumored delays in the new iPhone models, Griffin seemingly ducked the question. He did, though, offer some insight into the ramp-up.
"We are seeing a predictable cycle with our largest customer, and the areas that we can control are around content reach and our ability to drive technology," Griffin said.

"Content reach" is a fancy way of referring to how much revenue per iPhone Skyworks can grab, and "ability to drive technology" seems to be Griffin's way of indicating that the better Skyworks' technology is, the more potential share per iPhone it can grab.
"We feel really good about that equation," Griffin added.
As far as the ramp-up itself, Griffin didn't offer specifics on timing, but he did say the management team feels comfortable with company's "backlog visibility and forward-looking momentum" with respect to Apple.
What Griffin appears to be saying here is that irrespective of the timing of the product ramp-up -- which Griffin might not want to give away to protect Apple's confidential information -- Skyworks has good visibility into the shape of the ramp-up once it begins.
"We feel good about the [product] cycle," Griffin elaborated. "And we have a very broad mix across legacy, new models, and also a portfolio of non-mobile products within that account."
In other words, Skyworks looks set to benefit nicely from the next iPhone.
Does Skyworks care about the modem vendor?
It's well known that Apple began dual-sourcing its cellular modems from both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), beginning with the iPhone 7-series and probably continuing for the foreseeable future.
However, as Barron's reports, analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a recent investor note that Skyworks had more content share in the Qualcomm-based phones, while rival Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) had more content in the Intel-based iPhone models.
Analyst Edward Snyder, on Skyworks' most recent earnings call, asked management about Skyworks' positioning in the various iPhone models this year.
"We expect to have a solid position with all of the basebands that our largest customers use; we feel very good about that," Griffin began. "We refresh our product line in ways that make sense; we have a technology reach that's expanded."
Griffin then went on to explain that Skyworks has "demonstrated [its] ability to work with multiple baseband providers."
"Nothing's different with our largest customer; we will demonstrate the same level of performance," he said.





How about content share gains?
As smartphones have gained increasingly robust cellular subsystems, many wireless-chip vendors have enjoyed generation-over-generation dollar content increases, sometimes substantially so.
On the call, analyst Chris Caso asked management about the trend in dollar content per phone for the coming iPhone models, as well as some information about the impact of Apple's product mix on Skyworks' business.
To that, Griffin explained that the company "can't get into too much detail here with [its] largest customer," but he added that the company is "confident in what [it has] modeled financially."
"We understand what we've won with respect to content, and we completely understand where the mix is and having all that flush through with our guidance," Griffin explained.

3 Things Skyworks Solutions Inc. Management Wants You to Know
Skyworks is racking up more design wins for its wireless chips, diversifying its business, and improving its profitability. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Jul 21, 2017 at 4:30PM
            
            





Wireless chip-maker Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) reported its financial results and hosted a conference call going over those results on July 20.
"We delivered revenue of $901 million, up 20% year over year, with gross margin of 50.7% and operating margin of 37%," Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin said in a prepared statement.

Image source: Skyworks.

Griffin then went on to say that the company "achieved earnings per share of $1.57, up 27% year over year and $0.05 better than consensus [estimates]."
In this column, I'd like to go over three things from the company's most recent earnings call that management seems to want current and potential investors to know about the state of its business.
More design wins, more money
Griffin stated on the call that Skyworks is "aggressively expanding [its] design win pipeline."
"In mobile, we are broadening our reach across all premier OEMs," Griffin said. "Specifically, we supported Huawei's feature-rich smartphones with SkyOne and SkyLiTE products."
The executive then went on to say that the company also "extended DRx solutions for Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Galaxy Platform."
That wasn't all, either.
"We leveraged SkyOne and SkyLiTE at OPPO, Vivo, ZTE and Sharp, to name just a few," Griffin continued. "And we extended our antenna tuning wins across virtually all of the leading Chinese OEMs."
An expanding customer base could help Skyworks accelerate its revenue growth while simultaneously diluting its dependence on its largest customer -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The mobile/non-mobile split
Skyworks has traditionally generated most of its revenue from sales of chips to mobile device makers, and that's not expected to change for a while yet. However, diversification -- both in terms of customers as well as in terms of the end markets that a company serves -- is a good thing as it reduces a company's dependence on a single industry while simultaneously enabling more rapid total revenue growth.
On the call, Skyworks CFO Kris Sennesael said that during the company's most recent quarter, the revenue split between mobile-derived revenue and its "broad markets" revenue (i.e., non-mobile) was roughly 73% to 27%.
Griffin added some additional information, saying that the company expects its "broad markets" revenue to cross $250 million in the current quarter, representing a "$1 billion [annual] run rate."
"Broad markets has been performing very well and we put a lot of investment around that in our portfolio around Wi-Fi, around ZigBee, and even LTE in some cases is really helping propel that momentum," Griffin explained.





Progress toward gross margin target
Analyst Toshiya Hari observed on the call that Skyworks' gross profit margin percentage "has been relatively stable over the past, say, four to six quarters despite revenue being weaker a year ago and now much stronger today."
"So, basically, we haven't seen much leverage to the upside nor the downside," the analyst continued.
Hari then asked, "Can you remind us what the long-term goal is for [Skyworks] in terms of gross margins?"
Sennesael said that the company's "target is to get to 53%," and that the company is "making good progress toward that target."
The executive then pointed out that in the third quarter, Skyworks enjoyed a 30 basis point gross profit margin expansion and that the company is guiding to another 30 basis point gross profit margin expansion.
"And, of course, in the December quarter, we expect on higher revenue further improvements on the gross margin as well."
Gross margin expansion is important because the higher a company's gross profit margin percentage, the more of each dollar in revenue gets converted into gross profit. And, all else being equal, this means more of each dollar in revenue is ultimately converted into net income -- creating more value for a company's stockholders.
