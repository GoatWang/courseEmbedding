Noel G. Watson Appointed as Executive Chairman for Transition

 PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Jacobs
      Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today the retirement of
      Craig L. Martin as President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of
      the Board of Directors, effective on December 26, 2014, the last day of
      Jacobs' first quarter of fiscal 2015. Mr. Martin, 65, elected to retire
      for health reasons. He has been at Jacobs since 1994 and was promoted to
      President of Jacobs and joined the Board in 2002. He became Chief
      Executive Officer in 2006.
    

      The Board of Directors has appointed Noel G. Watson to serve as
      Executive Chairman until a new CEO is appointed. Mr. Watson has been
      Chairman of the Board since 2004, and was Chief Executive Officer from
      November 1992 to April 2006. He was also the President from 1987 until
      July 2002.
    

      “I would love to continue to lead this extraordinary organization, but
      it would be unfair to our employees and our shareholders for me to try
      to continue in my role and address my health issues,” said Craig L.
      Martin. “We have a number of excellent candidates for my replacement
      within the company, but I have encouraged the Board to look externally
      as well. I plan to remain available to Noel and the team to facilitate
      the best possible transition. As a significant shareholder myself, I
      look forward to watching the company grow and increase in value. I am
      confident in this team’s ability to meet my expectations.”
    

      “Craig has been a powerful force for growth during his twenty plus years
      with Jacobs,” said Noel G. Watson. “During his tenure as CEO, Jacobs has
      grown dramatically to become one of the largest and most diverse
      technical professional services firms in the world with approximately
      65,000 employees. Both on behalf of the Board and personally, I wish
      Craig all the best. We are disappointed to lose his considerable talent,
      but respect the difficult decision he made.”
    

      Consistent with its succession planning, the Jacobs Board has initiated
      a search process to identify a permanent CEO. The search process will be
      led by a committee of the Board consisting of Mr. Watson and the chairs
      of the Human Resource and Compensation Committee and the Nominating and
      Corporate Governance Committee, with the assistance of an executive
      search firm. The search process will include a full review of internal
      and external candidates. Mr. Martin has agreed to enter into an
      agreement to provide continued services for at least one year following
      his retirement as an executive to help ensure a smooth transition.
    

Edward V. Fritzky, who has been an independent director since 2004, will
      remain Lead Independent Director.
