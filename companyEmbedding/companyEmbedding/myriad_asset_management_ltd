Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

MYRIAD ASSET MANAGEMENT Just Released Its Q1 2015 Holdings


05/22/2015  by HedgeFundsTracker 
			in 13F Filings 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called MYRIAD ASSET MANAGEMENT Just Released Its Q1 2015 Holdings and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/myriad-asset-management-just-released-its-q1-2015-holdings/62378/.CaptchaSubmitMyriad Asset Management Ltd Stocks Overview
 Myriad Asset Management Ltd just filed its Q1 2015 13F. Dated 22/05/2015, the filing shows the active investment manager has a portfolio value of $1.04 billion, representing an increase of $474.16 million  from the previous quarter when it was $561.18 million. Note: This filling reprents only assets that which are listed in the US. Does such a big change means that the investment managers at Myriad Asset Management Ltd are getting more bullish on the stock market or just the opportunity on the long side is constrained?

 Fund New Stocks
During this quarter, Myriad Asset Management Ltd new positions included Jetblue Airways Corp (JBLU) for $125.77 million, Wellpoint Inc (Prn) for $51.64 million, Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd (Prn) for $34.25 million, Teleflex Inc (Prn) for $31.12 million and Xilinx Inc (Prn) for $29.63 million. These were the 5 biggest new positions. In total the active investment manager bought 30 new stocks.

13F Sector AllocationInformation Technology18%Transports12%Consumer Discretionary4%Utilities & Telecommunications4%Health Care2%






Increased Positions
 Based on this filing the active investment manager lifted its stakes in Tesla Mtrs Inc (Prn) by 6% to $48.17 million, Jarden Corp (Prn) by 33% to $51.53 million, Level 3 Communications Inc (LVLT) by 34% to $45.74 million, Micron Technology Inc (MU) by 77% to $37.54 million and Ctrip Com Intl Ltd (CTRP) by 20% to $31.24 million. Myriad Asset Management Ltd also acquired smaller stakes in Vipshop Hldgs Ltd (Prn) by 88.00% to $36.81 million, Ikang Healthcare Group Inc (KANG) by 52.11% to $16.59 million and Amag Pharmaceuticals Inc (Prn) by 150.00% to $15.57 million. Building positions gradually is common practice for many institutional investors. 
 Sold Positions
This fund sold its stakes in Sandisk Corp (Prn), Intel Corp (Prn), United States Stl Corp New (Prn), Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Trina Solar Limited (TSL). These stocks constituted 11.12%, 3.41%, 1.88%, 1.31% and 0.26% of the manager’s portfolio, respectively. We can only speculate about the reasons for the selling but we believe it has to do with either value, momentum or a better place for Myriad Asset Management Ltd’s capital.

Reduced Positions
The fund also reduced its postitons in Novellus Sys Inc (Prn) by -20.00%, Alibaba Group Hldg Ltd (BABA) by -0.90%, Ctrip Com Intl Ltd (Prn) by -9.09%, Apple Inc (AAPL) by -49.04% and Citrix Sys Inc (CTXS) by -5.07%. 
Top 3 Holdings
Jetblue Airways Corp (JBLU), Wellpoint Inc (Prn) and Jarden Corp (Prn) made up the majority of Myriad Asset Management Ltd’s total US long portfolio in Q1 2015. These securities were top 3 and constitute 22.12% of Myriad Asset Management Ltd’s US-listed securities. The top 10 securities make about 49.82% of the investment manager’s portfolio.

 It seems Myriad Asset Management Ltd holds concentrated portfolio. We wonder do they believe, same as many legendary traders, that diversification is losing investment strategy? The image above provides a snapshot of Myriad Asset Management Ltd’s top 10 US-listed equity positions in Q1 2015.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
