 Employer

 Dow 30 Premium & Dividend Income Fund Inc.



William J. Rainer is a former regulator and an industry executive. He currently serves as chairman of the board of Dow 30 Premium & Dividend Income Fund Inc.[1]
He was previously the chairman of Defined Strategy Fund Inc., a diversified closed-end management investment company that went out of business in 2009.[2] [3] He also serves on the international advisory board of Madrid-based IE Business School.[4]
He is a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and former chairman of the single-stock futures exchange OneChicago.[5][6]  He also co-founded Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., a primary dealer of government securities. 


Background
Rainer was recruited in 2001 to lead Chicago financial markets' venture OneChicago LLC into the trading of single-stock futures. He resigned from the position in 2004, stating that he was leaving to spend more time on family-owned enterprises. OneChicago was authorized by a 2000 rewrite of federal securities laws that included input from Rainer during his stint as chairman of the CFTC.[7]
Rainer was sworn in as a commissioner and the eighth chairman of the CFTC on Aug. 11, 1999. Rainer was nominated by President Bill Clinton on June 23, 1999 and confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 5, 1999 to serve a term expiring Apr. 13, 2004. It was reported that Arkansas native Rainer slept in the Lincoln Bedroom at least once during the Clinton presidency, and his friendship with the Commander in Chief harked back to their Arkansas days.[8]
In 1981, Rainer co-founded Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., now a part of RBS. From 1981 to 1987, he served as managing director of the firm. From 1988 until he joined the CFTC, Rainer was a private investor. From 1994 until its privatization in 1998, Rainer was chairman of the United States Enrichment Corporation, a government-owned company set up to sell the nation’s uranium stockpile.[9]
From 1971 to 1981, Rainer worked on numerous assignments for Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc. His positions included: managing director, Kidder, Peabody Securities, Ltd. (London); manager, corporate bond trading; and director, fixed income marketing. 
After being part of minor league baseball, Rainer played professional baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization. He bats left and throws left.[10]
Rainer's nonprofit activities have included serving as trustee, Southern Methodist University; executive board member, the Fletcher School, Tufts University; and member of the board, Thomas J. Dodd Research Center. He joined the Dean's Council of the Harvard Divinity School in 2004 and served as its chairman from 2005 until 2013.[11]

Remarks of William J. Rainer, Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading          Commission, 22nd Annual Chicago-Kent College of Law Derivatives and          Commodities Law Institute, Chicago, Illinois


Remarks of
          William J. Rainer
          Chairman
          Commodity Futures Trading Commission


22nd Annual Chicago-Kent College of Law
         Derivatives
          and Commodities Law Institute
          Chicago, Illinois


October 28, 1999



         The question that I will address this morning is: "Must the CFTC
         change the way it regulates the financial futures markets?"
      

         The answer is an unequivocal "yes," and it is the dramatic
         changes in the markets themselves that demand such reform.
      

         Ten years ago, when the CFTC issued the swaps policy statement, the
         differences between swaps transactions and financial futures
         transactions were reasonably clear. Swaps were bilateral, tailored,
         and individually negotiated over the phone. Moreover, there were no
         clearinghouses for swaps. Since then, however, we have witnessed an
         inexorable creep towards standardization. And, with today�s
         technology, it has become increasingly difficult to find language that
         will preserve meaningful distinctions between the OTC swaps and
         financial futures.
      

         This convergence of the two markets has blurred the differences
         between swaps and futures, and attempts to differentiate the two are
         not only an increasingly futile exercise but have also created legal
         uncertainty in the OTC market and have distracted us from the task of
         reforming regulation of the futures markets.
      

         Therefore, in examining both the OTC derivatives market and the
         exchange traded financial futures market, we must carefully analyze
         whether or not the broad statutory goals, set forth many years ago in
         the Commodity Exchange Act, can continue to drive the correct
         regulatory policy.
      

         Shortly after I took this job, I studied Section 3 of the Act and
         found three basic purposes for the regulatory structure currently
         administered by the CFTC: (1) to protect the price discovery function;
         (2) to prevent the manipulation of commodities through corners,
         squeezes and similar schemes; and (3) to assure an effective vehicle
         for risk transference. Implicit throughout is the need to provide
         suitable customer protection from abusive trade practices and fraud.
      

         Do these purposes fit the financial futures and derivatives markets
         today? Let�s examine them one by one.
      

         First, price discovery: With respect to financial futures, such as the
         bond contract, there is no critical price discovery role, at least not
         in the classic sense, as there is in the case of a physical commodity
         such as cotton. Users may rely on the price information of the
         bond contract, but the government bond market does not discover
         the long bond price through the bond future. The cotton industry, on
         the other hand, does discover its price through the cotton futures
         contract. Simply stated, there is no case for regulating financial
         futures on the basis of price discovery.
      

         Second, manipulation: The long list of attempts to manipulate physical
         commodities is well known. Indeed, the need to prevent manipulation is
         the primary reason this agency and its predecessor came into being.
         Manipulation continues, as we recently witnessed in the case of
         copper.
      

         But what is the record of manipulation in the financial arena? We now
         have more than 20 years of experience with the bond contract and
         foreign currencies, and about as much experience with other financial
         futures. The CFTC�s enforcement record contains only two minor
         cases of attempted manipulation in any of these instruments, which is
         remarkable; but one must remember the size of these markets: T-bonds
         alone trade 350,000 to 400,000 contracts a day.
      

         While we cannot discount to zero the chances that someone may come up
         with a successful manipulation scheme in the future, I am skeptical
         whether, in light of this experience, the public policy objective of
         preventing the remote possibility of manipulation warrants the current
         level of regulation for financial instruments.
      

         Third, risk transference: "Risk transference" is a function
         of these markets and therefore a valid reason for regulation. Again we
         must ask how much regulation is required to achieve an effective
         result. That is to say, there are only a few ways to hedge
         agricultural products, but financial market practitioners typically
         have at their disposal a wide array of effective risk management tools
         available in a number of different markets.
      

         Finally, we need to determine the suitable level of customer
         protection. The financial futures markets are open to the widest
         variety of participants: from Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to the
         relatively inexperienced individual speculator. The over-the-counter
         swaps market is almost entirely a sophisticated market, composed
         mostly of professional dealers and institutional investors.
         Historically, because our regulatory policy has been transaction
         based, we have had a "one-size-fits-all" approach to rules
         protecting customers. Again, the question is do the facts support
         current regulatory policy? We recognize that similar to the OTC
         market, the financial futures markets are also predominantly
         institutional. We may need to make new judgments with respect to the
         appropriate level of customer protection.
      

         The CFTC�s statutory goals and regulatory policy today fit
         neither the financial futures markets nor OTC derivatives. The CFTC
         has focused on the common element of futurity in the instruments we
         regulate. One of the fundamental shifts that the CFTC needs to make is
         to recognize that financial futures are not the same as metals
         futures, energy futures or agricultural futures. Financial futures
         cannot be isolated from the rest of the global financial markets, and
         we should regulate from that perspective.
      

         The awkward fit between U.S. regulatory policy and the markets would
         not matter � and until recently has not mattered very much �
         as long as the public interest did not suffer. But today at least
         three vital priorities are not being met, namely: (1) the need to
         enhance economic efficiency and competition; (2) the need to encourage
         innovation in technology for the markets; and (3) the need to mitigate
         systemic risk in the rapidly growing OTC markets by encouraging
         developments such as clearinghouses.
      

         The national interest in fostering economic efficiency and competition
         in the OTC derivatives market can only be accomplished by establishing
         clear legal certainty for over-the-counter derivatives. The CEA was
         not designed to regulate the OTC market. The benefits from such legal
         certainty are self-evident and warrant no further comment here.
      

         Our economy will profit from the efficiencies created by technological
         advances � trades will be consummated faster and with lower
         costs, and this will lead to a decrease in the cost of capital.
         National and international markets will also gain from the development
         of a clearinghouse for these markets � among other benefits,
         netting helps decrease systemic risk while achieving more efficient
         use of capital. These are all areas that are being addressed through
         the auspices of the President�s Working Group on Financial
         Markets.
      

         But in formulating a comprehensive approach to address the public
         policy priorities for OTC derivatives, it is the profound challenge of
         the CFTC to address those same priorities for the financial futures
         markets.
      

         The CFTC�s regulatory policy must ensure that there is a balance
         between the regulatory environment for OTC derivatives and the level
         of regulation applied to the financial futures markets. These markets
         are simply too important to the nation�s economy to ignore the
         potential damage from disparate regulatory structures.
      

         The financial futures markets by any measure are huge, take for
         example the bond contract and the Eurodollar contract. The bond
         contract trades a notional value of about $35-40 billion a day; the
         Eurodollar contract usually trades more than $300 billion a day.
      

         As we tailor policy to fit the three fundamental priorities of
         efficiency and competition, technological advances, and reduction of
         systemic risk, it is important that the financial futures markets
         receive commensurate regulatory adjustments. The government must not
         inadvertently pick winners and losers as we attempt to reshape the
         regulatory landscape for all financial markets.
      

         Consequently, the CFTC must embark on a process that may result in
         major deregulation of the financial futures markets, beginning with
         those contracts that compete directly with OTC derivatives. No rule or
         regulation will escape scrutiny. While the financial futures markets
         are most in need of regulatory reform, all of our contract markets
         would benefit from a lighter regulatory hand. The CFTC intends to
         withdraw from approving contract designations and will soon issue
         proposed regulations to permit exchanges to adopt new rules without
         prior approval. These are key elements in our overall plan to move
         from being a frontline to an oversight regulator.
      

         In adopting an oversight role, the CFTC will consider a number of
         alternative market models. In the past, we have issued rules
         authorizing the establishment of professional markets, and while these
         proved unsuccessful, some may think this idea worth revisiting.
         Establishing "pro markets" might appear to be the easiest or
         quickest way to achieve competitive equilibrium between exchange and
         over-the-counter markets, but this design may have negative effects on
         cost and liquidity. The efficiency of the futures markets and their
         depth of liquidity for risk management activity rely upon their public
         nature. We should be very careful about creating a regulatory climate
         that would force exchanges to become exclusively professional markets
         to remain competitive.
      

         There is no doubt that some of these objectives will be difficult to
         achieve, but our nation�s priorities in the area of financial
         regulation dictate that we start to examine and regulate products,
         entities and exchanges on a rational basis and not be bound by
         tradition.
      

         Since I know that there are many other hot topics that I have not
         addressed � from the policy modifications required to change the
         CFTC from frontline to oversight regulation to the importance of
         information sharing with international regulators � I�ll
         stop here and open the floor for a few questions.

Testimony of Chairman William J. Rainer before the Senate Agriculture          Committee

William J. Rainer
          Chairman
          Commodity Futures Trading Commission


Testimony Before the Senate
         Agriculture Committee


Hearing on the Report by the
         President's Working Group on Financial Markets: "Over the
         Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange
         Act"


February 10,
         2000




Thank you Chairman Lugar, Senator Harkin
         and members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to come
         here and discuss the recommendations of the President's Working
         Group on Financial Markets regarding the Commodity Exchange Act and
         over-the-counter derivatives transactions.


U.S. financial markets generally are the
         envy of the world, whether we are speaking of futures, swaps or
         securities. Each of these sectors plays an important role in
         maintaining America's leadership in this area.


Our country's position in the OTC
         market is affected by uncertainty over the legal status of many
         derivatives transactions. This uncertainty turns on whether or not
         transactions could be invalidated under the CEA.


The members of the Working Group are
         unanimous in our assessment of America's national economic
         priorities for the over-the-counter derivatives markets. These goals
         have already been mentioned, namely:


� to promote technological
         innovation, competition, efficiency, liquidity and transparency;
         and


� to reduce systemic risk by
         encouraging the market to develop regulated clearing systems.


The ability to achieve these will be
         enhanced through greater legal certainty for the OTC market.
         Congressional action to exclude OTC financial derivatives from the Act
         would provide such certainty.


I can advocate this step because OTC
         derivatives transactions as we know them today do not present
         regulatory concerns within the scope of the Act. Also, excluding this
         activity will not diminish the CFTC's ability to carry out the
         statutory mission it is charged to fulfill.


* * *


When the Commodity Exchange Act was
         written, Congress articulated the rationale for regulating futures
         transactions. First, the Act establishes the economic utility of
         futures trading, stating that futures prices "are generally
         quoted and disseminated throughout the United States and in foreign
         countries as a basis for determining prices to the producer and the
         consumer of commodities ...." In addition to their price
         discovery function, futures transactions are used by commercial
         handlers "as a means of hedging themselves against possible loss
         through fluctuations in price." CEA Section 3.


The second prong of Congress'
         rationale for regulation is that the "transactions and prices of
         commodities ... are susceptible to excessive speculation and can be
         manipulated, controlled, cornered or squeezed ...." The risks of
         price distortion and manipulation are the factors "rendering
         regulation [of these markets] imperative ...." CEA Section
         3. Congress thus identified the overarching public mission of the
         CFTC as that of preventing price manipulation and ensuring price
         transparency.


* * *


Like exchange-traded futures, OTC
         derivatives are risk-shifting instruments. The Working Group, however,
         has determined that, unlike futures, "prices established in OTC
         derivatives transactions do not serve a significant price discovery
         role." PWG Report at 16. The Working Group also has
         concluded that "[m]ost OTC derivatives are not susceptible to
         manipulation." Id.


According to the Bank for International
         Settlements, 72 percent of OTC derivatives are interest rate contracts
         and 26 percent are foreign exchange contracts.1 A report issued recently by the Office of
         the Comptroller of the Currency stated that interest rate contracts
         constitute 79 percent of derivatives held in US commercial banks.
         Interest rate and currency products, which together comprise 98
         percent of the OTC derivatives market, do not present the concerns
         Congress addressed in mandating the regulation of futures.


Moreover, OTC transactions are entered
         into and traded by sophisticated institutional traders, who are able
         to look out for themselves in these markets. Also, most dealers in the
         swaps market are either affiliated with broker-dealers or futures
         commission merchants that are regulated by the SEC or the CFTC, or are
         financial institutions that are subject to supervision by bank
         regulatory agencies. Therefore, the activities of most derivatives
         dealers already are subject to direct or indirect federal oversight.
         PWG Report at 16.


Because there is no manifest regulatory
         interest warranting CFTC oversight of OTC derivatives, I support the
         exclusion proposed by the Working Group.


Congress and the CFTC have acted before
         to resolve legal uncertainty affecting OTC derivatives. In 1992, amid
         strong signals that swap market participants feared their contracts
         could be declared unenforceable, Congress responded decisively,
         instructing the CFTC not to regulate swaps entered into by
         sophisticated parties. Congress authorized the CFTC to provide
         exemptive relief for swaps without requiring the agency to make a
         threshold determination that particular exempted transactions fell
         within its jurisdiction.2 The CFTC
         promptly issued a rule exempting swap agreements from all provisions
         of the Act except prohibitions against fraud and manipulation,
         provided the swaps meet certain conditions.


The CFTC's swaps exemption worked
         relatively well. Lately, however, evolution in the OTC derivatives
         market has rendered the exemption inadequate for some purposes.


The swaps exemptive rule does not apply
         to OTC contracts that are standardized, cleared, or executed under
         conditions that approximate those of an organized exchange.
         Technology, however, is dramatically changing the structure and nature
         of many aspects of the financial services industry. The rise of
         electronic, screen-based trading has blurred the line drawn in our
         swaps exemption between bilateral and multilateral trading. The growth
         in swap volume, and the acceptance of these contracts by a wider range
         of users, has led to their standardization. Public policy must meet
         these advances in the OTC market.


I also believe that the development of
         regulated clearing systems should be encouraged. Clearing systems can
         employ a variety of risk management tools, such as mutualizing risk
         and offsetting multiple obligations. Consequently, clearing systems
         help reduce systemic risk by lowering the possibility that the failure
         of a single market participant could disproportionately disrupt or
         impact the overall market.


Finally, the Commission's rule
         exempts bilateral swaps from all provisions of the CEA except those
         provisions prohibiting manipulation and fraud. The CFTC thought it
         prudent to retain its jurisdiction to act in the event the agency
         learned that participants were engaging in fraudulent or manipulative
         conduct and that transactions executed under the exemption were, in
         fact, futures.


The swaps exemption does not alter the
         CFTC's responsibility to take action against this misconduct. In a
         given set of circumstances, however, the agency's ability to act
         may be contingent upon proving that transactions are futures or
         options.3 This is a critical point
         to remember: at no time has Congress or the CFTC made the definitive
         judgment that swap transactions are, in fact, subject to the CEA's
         jurisdiction. The combination of responsibility with no more than
         contingent authority, is simply bad public policy because as a
         practical matter, the CFTC cannot exercise its residual enforcement
         authority under the swaps exemption without exacerbating the existing
         legal uncertainty in this area.


* * *


Apart from legal certainty issues
         regarding OTC derivatives, the Working Group report contains
         recommendations aimed at improving the regulatory framework for other
         financial instruments. Some of these proposals have been addressed by
         other members of the Group. I would like to comment on the
         recommendation to alter the "Treasury Amendment" provision
         of the Act to give the CFTC explicit jurisdiction over unregulated
         entities that sell foreign exchange instruments to the public at
         large.


Abusive promoters have exploited
         regulatory gaps to sell foreign currency contracts to financially
         unsophisticated individuals, making exaggerated claims of profit
         opportunities and failing to disclose the risks of these inherently
         volatile instruments. Promoters often target senior citizens, recent
         arrivals in this country and other vulnerable segments of
         society.


Many of these enterprises simply pocket
         investor funds; others channel funds to currency markets, but
         typically do so without adequate segregation or disclosure. As
         fraudulent forex companies proliferated, the agency in 1998 issued a
         consumer advisory through the mass media warning the public about
         these schemes. Cases filed by the CFTC against illegal foreign
         currency operations during the 1990s have involved more than $250
         million in customer funds.


Courts in which the CFTC has brought
         enforcement actions have reached varying decisions regarding our
         jurisdiction over these instruments. In those jurisdictions where we
         have not been foreclosed judicially from enforcement action, we
         continue to move aggressively against retail forex fraud. We also
         cooperate with state, local and other federal authorities to bring a
         halt to this activity.


We ask Congress to clarify our authority
         to regulate these instruments so that we may provide a stronger
         deterrent to fraud and abuse while providing a zone of comfort and
         rational oversight to legitimate enterprises that want to offer
         foreign currency contracts to the public.


* * *


While examining the applicability of the
         Act to OTC markets, we also have conducted an inquiry into whether our
         current regulatory scheme is appropriately tailored to today's
         environment for exchange-traded futures. During the past several
         months, the agency has undertaken a serious effort to answer the
         question: what degree of exchange-traded regulation is necessary to
         serve the public interests entrusted to us?


This inquiry is at the heart of the
         process that the CFTC has engaged in over the last several months. A
         strong consensus exists among ourselves, Congress and the Working
         Group that such a review is needed.


Impending technological changes require
         the CFTC to scrutinize the continued vitality and viability of its
         one-size-fits-all regulatory structure that currently applies to all
         futures transactions. While that process is not yet complete, certain
         clear principles have emerged: one, the historic needs of traditional
         physical commodities should not be the basis for regulating every
         futures contract traded today; two, institutional market participants
         do not require all of the protections designed for retail
         traders.


Although I will not get into much detail
         here, let me say that at its core, this plan will afford market
         participants the opportunity to operate in a regulatory environment
         suited to the product traded and the participants trading it. The key
         policy elements of this plan include a move from direct to more
         oversight regulation; a move from prescriptive rules to flexible
         performance standards; and the increased use of disclosure-based
         regulation.


This plan will not impair the
         agency's ability to assure the fundamental market integrity that
         is expected when conducting futures exchange transactions in the
         United States, or when relying upon the prices set in US
         exchange-traded markets. The Commission will continue to exercise its
         authority to oversee their continued integrity.


* * *


In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, time is not
         our ally in establishing a framework that achieves our national
         economic priorities with respect to derivatives trading. Technology
         has made it increasingly easy to establish rival markets in foreign
         jurisdictions; technology has also increased the speed with which new
         innovations are introduced and widely used by market participants.
         Because of these realities, I ask Congress to act expeditiously on the
         recommendations of the Working Group.


Thank you again for the opportunity to
         testify before you today. I look forward to continued collaboration
         with the rest of the Group and the members of this Committee to see
         these recommendations enacted into law this year.
