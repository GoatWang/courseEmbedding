Good Times Restaurants Inc. Hires New Chief Financial Officer






Business Wire




Jul 19, 2017 1:35 PM EDT













 




























































  Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ: GTIM), owner of Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard, a regional quick-service restaurant chain focused on fresh, high quality, all natural products, and of Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, a full service, upscale concept, today announced the resignation of Jim Zielke as Chief Financial Officer and the hiring of Ryan Zink as its new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Zielke's resignation as Chief Financial Officer will take effect on July 31, 2017; however, Mr. Zielke will continue as an employee of the Company through August 31, 2017 to facilitate his successor's transition into the role.  Mr. Zielke submitted his formal resignation as a result of an ownership opportunity in a privately held restaurant company. The Company has had prior discussions with Mr. Zink, who worked extensively with Mr. Zielke while at F&H Acquisition Corp, and they will have approximately one month of working together for a transition prior to Mr. Zielke's departure.  Prior to his appointment as Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Zink, 38, was the Corporate Finance Director and Reporting Leader, and previously Operations Controller for INVISTA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., positions he has held since March 2014. From January 2000 to March 2014, he served in various capacities with F&H Acquisition Corp., parent of the Fox and Hound, and Champps restaurant brands, including Senior Vice President of Finance, and Chief Operating Officer for its Champps concept. Prior to his service with F&H, Mr. Zink worked for KPMG, LLP.  "We appreciate all of the hard work and contributions that Jim has made on behalf of the Company over the last two plus years and we wish him well in his new venture. Ryan came highly recommended, not only by Jim but by others that have worked with him inside and outside the restaurant industry for his intellect, work ethic, financial sophistication and experience. He brings the same great combination of internal financial skills and ability to communicate with the financial community as Jim, but also more experience in other roles managing a restaurant company in the public markets," said Boyd Hoback, President & CEO. "He has extensive experience in the IT, marketing and operating arenas with considerable depth in financial planning, analysis and forecasting. We expect that Ryan will be able to continue to improve on our strong foundation of systems to support our significant expansion plans and help to improve our operating margins by working closely with our operations teams for both brands."

Good Times Restaurants Inc. Announces New Handbreaded, Responsibly Raised Chicken Tenderloin Platfor - AOL Finance
























































































Good Times Restaurants Inc. Announces New Handbreaded, Responsibly Raised Chicken Tenderloin Platfor







Share














Business Wirevia The Motley Fool, AOL.com
Jan 30th 2013 9:49AM




Good Times Restaurants Inc. Announces New Handbreaded, Responsibly Raised Chicken Tenderloin PlatformGOLDEN, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Good Times Restaurants Inc.  (NAS: GTIM)  today announced it is rolling out a new chicken platform in February and March based on Springer Mountain Farms antibiotic-free, hormone-free, responsibly raised chicken tenderloins that will be hand breaded daily in each of its restaurants. The Company said that the move will make Good Times the only quick service restaurant in its market that serves all natural, responsibly raised beef and chicken that is hormone free, antibiotic free with no pesticides or animal byproducts in the feed.Commenting on the introduction, President & CEO, Boyd Hoback said, "For years we have used Coleman and Meyer Ranch All Natural beef and we'll now be able to offer a true all natural chicken with the Springer Mountain Farms product, which we believe is the highest quality available in the market. 'All Natural' by itself has become so overused as to be rendered somewhat meaningless and we are committed to offering a true natural product with protocols that ensure no hormones, no antibiotics, no pesticides or animal byproducts in the feed and responsible practices for animal welfare and environmental impact, which both Meyer Ranch Beef and Springer Mountain Farms rigorously follow."The Company reported that the new chicken platform has been in test for the past several months and has yielded substantially increased chicken sales as a percentage of its total sales at those test restaurants. Hoback added, "It's taken quite a bit of refinement by our operations team for us to deliver the quality and consistency we need by hand breading in each restaurant, but the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. It is a strategic move that aligns with our brand position to offer fresh, all natural, handcrafted quality and helps to continue to differentiate us from the larger QSR competitors. We plan to support the product introduction with television advertising and extensive sampling to generate trial and awareness."Meyer Ranch Beef is the only major beef brand that has earned both the Certified Humane designation for its animal husbandry processes and the American Culinary Federation's Seal of Approval for superior quality. The cattle are fed a vegetarian diet of grasses and grains, and never includes hormones or antibiotics. Meyer also verifies the origins of its cattle and ensures they are born, raised, fed and processed solely in the United States.Springer Mountain Farms Chicken is the first poultry company in the world to be American Humane Certified by the American Humane Association. Their chickens are not only 100% All Natural with no steroids or hormones, but also are produced with no antibiotics. All of their chickens are fed solely a pesticide free, vegetarian diet.Good Times is a regional chain of quick service restaurants located primarily in Colorado providing a menu of high quality all natural hamburgers, 100% breast of chicken sandwiches, fresh frozen custard, fresh squeezed lemonades, fresh cut fries and other unique offerings. Good Times currently operates and franchises 39 restaurants.This press release contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. The words "intend," "may," "believe," "will," "should," "anticipate," "expect," "seek" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause Good Times' actual results to differ materially from results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. These risks include such factors as the uncertain nature of current restaurant development plans and the ability to implement those plans, delays in developing and opening new restaurants because of weather, local permitting or other reasons, increased competition, cost increases or shortages in raw food products, and other matters discussed under the "Risk Factors" section of Good Times' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 filed with the SEC. Although Good Times may from time to time voluntarily update its forward looking statements, it disclaims any commitment to do so except as required by securities laws.Good Times Restaurants Inc.Boyd E.

What is 
Natural, 
Anyways?



Natural Isn't New
Natural this, natural that. It's a term you're probably starting to hear pretty frequently, but one that doesn't often get explained.
So, what exactly does it mean to be natural?



Is that feed vegan? Yes, we started in Boulder, so our animals embraced their inner hippy. All of our suppliers use high grade vegetarian feed and have certifications that are third party verified to ensure the best diets possible. Absolutely no animal by-products are used in their diets. But, we think our cows would look great in flowered headbands.



We prefer our animals drug-free.  This means they are NEVER EVER fed any antibiotics, steroids or added hormones.  Think of them as teetotalers (or fans of Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No to Drugs” campaign).  So you are clear, the FDA allows the usage of steroids and added hormones in the raising of beef. However, the FDA prevents the usage of steroids and added hormones in the raising of chicken, so if you see that as an added “feature”, know that they aren’t doing anything above and beyond the minimum requirements.
Some companies also use antibiotics up to a certain point in the animal’s life cycle and then stop, claiming to be antibiotic-free.  Not our suppliers.  We believe in transparency and NEVER EVER giving the animals antibiotics.  80% of all antibiotics sold in the US are for use on livestock and poultry, not humans!  And the majority of those antibiotics are not even given to animals who are sick.  The purpose is to use them as a substitute for healthier living conditions and to make chickens and cows grow faster.  We prefer naturally developed animals, not big green Hulk ones!



No jokes here, we just want to make sure that our animals are raised in an environment with the strictest humane standards. Looking out for their wellbeing includes low stress conditions and handling, spacious living environment, protection from the elements, and socialization.  We do everything short of tucking them in at night.

Why is this 
important?











Apple had just released iTunes.



Justin Timberlake went solo. (RIP N’Sync)



Flip phones were the height of style.



Kelly Clarkson was crowned American Idol.



The Terminator was elected Governator.





It all started with our burgers, and we made it our goal to keep it going with our chicken as well. Today we can proudly say that we have achieved that goal!













Our burgers are only made from Meyer All-Natural Angus Beef that's been humanely raised on a strict vegetarian diet, with no steroids, growth hormones or antibiotics. Ever. Skipping the steroids, growth hormones and antibiotics allows the animals to mature slowly for optimal tenderness and marbling.  All of their cattle is humanely-raised on small to mid-sized family farms.  The company developed the Meyer Natural Foods Humanely Handled Program to ensure maximum benefit for the cattle.  This program is a USDA FSIS Approved Third Party Certification Process.  Meyer Natural Angus verifies the source and age of all their cattle to ensure they are born, raised, fed and processed in accordance with the full requirements of the program and only in the USA.

We went all the way to Springer Mountain Farms in the Blue Ridge Mountains to bring you our, hand-breaded, all-natural, responsibly-raised, antibiotic-free chicken. Yes, that’s a mouthful. A tasty mouthful.  Springer Mountain Farms is the first chicken farm to earn the American Humane Society Certification.  That’s why their chickens are fed a pesticide free, vegetarian diet of corn and soybean without the use of antibiotics, growth stimulants or hormones, or animal by-products. 100% of the corn and soybean that Springer Mountain Farms  uses is grown right here in the United States. They do not import any ingredients from other countries. The corn and soybean meal is extensively tested on-site in their USDA Certified laboratory not only for nutrient value, energy, protein, minerals, and amino acids, but also for numerous quality standards such as molds, moisture, grade of product, and pesticide contamination. They are one of the few poultry producers who can and do test ingredients this extensively.

Our crisp, iceberg lettuce, garden ripe tomatoes and whole Bermuda onions taste fresh because they are fresh. Hand-cut every morning right from the crisper.




We went all the way to Springer Mountain Farms in the Blue Ridge Mountains to bring you our new, hand-breaded, all-natural, responsibly-raised, antibiotic-free chicken. Yes, that’s a mouthful. A tasty mouthful.




There’s only one way to make real guac, and that’s with real avocados from real avocado trees. Then we add tomatoes, cilantro, garlic and two kinds of peppers, serrano and jalapeño, to make the sparks fly.




If bacon sizzling on the skillet makes your taste buds get all tingly inside, then you’re a bacon lover who would never allow a microwaved limp parody of pork anywhere near your burger.




Citrus gold in a glass, made from real lemons. The perfect combination of sweet and tart you just can’t get from a powdered mix.




We mix all-natural milk, cream, eggs, sugar and real Madagascar vanilla throughout the day in patented, premium ice cream makers designed to take out all the ice crystals and air, and leave only rich, cold deliciousness.




Our fries aren’t cooked until you order them, so you taste all their piping hot, lightly dusted with sea salt goodness when you pop them into your mouth.




Our burgers are only made from Meyer All-Natural Angus Beef that’s been humanely raised on a strict vegetarian diet, with no steroids, growth hormones or antibiotics. Ever.

Hires New Chief Financial OfficerBusiness WireJuly 19, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Good Times Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ: GTIM), owner of Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard, a regional quick-service restaurant chain focused on fresh, high quality, all natural products, and of Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar, a full service, upscale concept, today announced the resignation of Jim Zielke as Chief Financial Officer and the hiring of Ryan Zink as its new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Zielke’s resignation as Chief Financial Officer will take effect on July 31, 2017; however, Mr. Zielke will continue as an employee of the Company through August 31, 2017 to facilitate his successor’s transition into the role.Mr. Zielke submitted his formal resignation as a result of an ownership opportunity in a privately held restaurant company. The Company has had prior discussions with Mr. Zink, who worked extensively with Mr. Zielke while at F&H Acquisition Corp, and they will have approximately one month of working together for a transition prior to Mr. Zielke’s departure.Prior to his appointment as Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Zink, 38, was the Corporate Finance Director and Reporting Leader, and previously Operations Controller for INVISTA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., positions he has held since March 2014. From January 2000 to March 2014, he served in various capacities with F&H Acquisition Corp., parent of the Fox and Hound, and Champps restaurant brands, including Senior Vice President of Finance, and Chief Operating Officer for its Champps concept. Prior to his service with F&H, Mr. Zink worked for KPMG, LLP.“We appreciate all of the hard work and contributions that Jim has made on behalf of the Company over the last two plus years and we wish him well in his new venture. Ryan came highly recommended, not only by Jim but by others that have worked with him inside and outside the restaurant industry for his intellect, work ethic, financial sophistication and experience. He brings the same great combination of internal financial skills and ability to communicate with the financial community as Jim, but also more experience in other roles managing a restaurant company in the public markets,” said Boyd Hoback, President & CEO. “He has extensive experience in the IT, marketing and operating arenas with considerable depth in financial planning, analysis and forecasting. We expect that Ryan will be able to continue to improve on our strong foundation of systems to support our significant expansion plans and help to improve our operating margins by working closely with our operations teams for both brands.”About Good Times Restaurants Inc.: Good Times Restaurants Inc.
