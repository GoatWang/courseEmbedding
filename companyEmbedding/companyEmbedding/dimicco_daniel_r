  Trump on Trade by Dan DiMicco

The Trump trade policy is both sound and necessary in today's World where 'Trade Cheating' has become the norm. Nowhere is it more rampant and destructive than in the case of China. It is the 8000 pound Gorilla when it comes to Cheating. They have done this through their massive 'State Owned Enterprises' and State Owned Economy. They have done it by stealing IP and Cheating in Trade.      The types of Trade Cheating to manipulate trade and make free trade an irrelevant concept include currencymanipulation, massive subsidies to export related industries, the use of atax system that works both as a tariff barrier for inbound goods and asubsidy mechanism for targeted export products. The VAT tax, as it is known, or value added tax is both predatory and protectionist to an extreme. Added together all these have resulted in the end of global Free Trade.  Hillary Clinton has claimed Trump's trade policies will start a "Trade War" but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one. Trump clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to China's 'Mercantilist Trade War'! A War it has been waging against us for nearly 2 decades! A war in which we have yet to show up to fight! Trump gets it! He knows that it is past time to put an end to this attack on our Economy, 'Good' paying Job Creation, our Manufacturing Sector, our National Security, and the future of our Middle Class. He will do this by negotiating from a position of strength, not condescending weakness. China respects strength but takes full advantage of weakness. In the end it will be in China's best interest to stop cheating on trade.     It's not just the USA that has had it with China's Mercantilism, predatory export pricing, and massive protectionism at home. In today's WSJ article by Andrew Byrne, "China's One-Way Deals Grate on Germany" in which Germany's Chancellor Merkel " loses patience with China's shopping spree in Europe as it closes its own markets".   Trump also knows that it is this very Mercantilism that has not only undermined the concept of Free Trade but 'Killed it'! Clyde Prestowitz in his excellent article in the Washington Monthly titled "Free Trade is Dead" drives home this point and how the countless FTA's the US has put in place have failed America, its economy, and its workers.   During ERA of "Free Trade", since 1990, our accumulated trade deficit in goods is approaching $13 Trillion. Most every FTA from NAFTA to the Korean FTA has not just failed to live up to it promises but failed miserably. Net-Net, Trade and good paying job creation have been seriously negative. The two worst agreements were giving China 'favored nations trading status' and allowing them entry into the WTO. The latter before they became a 'Market driven economy', which they still are not today. Trump knows this but Hillary Clinton has first been against and then voted for most FTA's that have been approved by Congress. Trump gets what Hillary doesn't, you don't win a Trade War with appeasement or more Free Trade agreements. In particular, you cant win one if you refuse to acknowledge it even exists!ere to edit.

You can see the entire article by cloicking on the link below, but i have included the most important Part of his excellent article.Danhttp://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2016/free-trade-is-dead/.........."The next president needs to recognize that globalization is deeply geopolitical and should pursue a new set of agreements over the rules of globalization. It needs to have as its central aim the replacement of the U.S.’s unilateral role as buyer of last resort with new arrangements that accomplish the same goal of providing demand, especially at moments when global recessions loom, but in a more equitable and sustainable way.For its own long-term economic health, it would be nice if the United States could just decide to remove the dollar from being the key reserve currency. But it cannot and, even if it could, should not do so hastily. A better approach would be for countries such as Japan, China, Germany, and South Korea to keep promises they have repeatedly made to switch from investment- and export-led growth to internal consumption–led growth.A weakness of the post–World War II trading system has always been that there was discipline on countries who ran chronic trade deficits but none on countries who ran chronic surpluses. What is needed now is for countries running chronic, large trade surpluses to be subject to the discipline of surcharges on their exports and limits on the accumulation of foreign assets.There should also be surcharges for other beggar-thy-neighbor behavior that threatens the global economy. One of those is “dumping”—flooding world markets with products at below home market and/or-cost-of production prices, often as a result of overcapacity driven by export-led growth policies. At the moment, for example, China has more than enough steel production capacity to supply total global demand all by itself. This is ruining the steel industries of Europe, Japan, and the United States, which otherwise are perfectly competitive. Another behavior deserving sanctions is the practice of countries offering subsidies—tax holidays, free land, training of workers, capital grants, utilities at half price—to lure companies to their shores, companies that are competitive where they are. Government-supported hacking operations that steal corporate intellectual property also need to be reined in.We need a new set of international agreements over the rules of globalization. The U.S.’s unilateral role as buyer of last resort must be replaced with new arrangements whereby all the leading economies share the burden."

Economist Peter Morici's view on Clinton's claim "the country does better with a Democrat in the White House"-Clinton's claims are nonsense--I agree!



		6/16/2016

  After listening to Economist Peter Morici Saturday on Fox and Friends (Sat June 11th) I asked him in an e-mail about Clinton's claim that the economy does better under Democratic Presidents than Republicans and here is what he said:Here are my views about Clinton's claim that the country does better with a Democrat in the White House Clinton's claims are nonsense:Obama and Reagan came into office under similar circumstances--each had an early recession with unemployment peaking at 10 percent and Reagan at 10.8 percent (who had the bigger hole?)Obama's recovery has registered 2.1 percent GDP growth, whereas Reagan's scored 4.6 percent, and for Obama employment is up 11 percent but for Reagan 22 percentFamily incomes are down about $1,600 on Obama’s watch, whereas those rose by $4,800 during the Reagan years.And the social indicators are terrible.The middle class is shrinking, suicides and drug abuse are up, fertility has dropped precipitously, millions of college graduates stuck in low-paying jobs and defaulting on education loans, and home ownership is at a 48 year low.For many minorities, the situation is even worse. African-American family incomes are down about $2,200, the wealth gap with whites is widening, and banks increasingly their access to home mortgages.****Economist: Lousy jobs report tells the truth about the Obama economy ( ...http://fxn.ws/1VBtUsr To listen to President Obama, Americans live in a liberal paradise—a robust economy, 75 consecutive months of jobs growth and a go ....From me--P.S.-- the widely acclaimed Clinton economy of the 90's was the direct result of two things, 1) Reagan laid the foundation for economic growth that both Bush I and Clinton experienced with large tax decreases, reduced regulation, and REAL economic growth, and, 2) The Republicans taking control of the House and the Contract with America that forced President Clinton to the center.He, Clinton, did his best to screw it up with huge tax increases and the passage of NAFTA, China's move to Favored Nations trading status, etc. The results of these moves are what Clinton really gave us, i.e.,  the 1991 recession and millions of lost manufacturing jobs continuing to this day

WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, TRUMP’S SPOT-ON



		6/1/2016

  President Reagan was the last to get it right on Trade--(see my earlier Reagan Post in Trade)Clyde once again is spot on...WAKE UP AMERICA!!!DanWHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, TRUMP’S SPOT-ON    By Clyde PrestowitzTribune News ServiceFor all his bullying, narcissism and self-contradiction, there is one point on which presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump cannot be criticized. In attacking our nation’s longtime free trade policies and deals, the real estate tycoon has brought necessary attention to a huge elephant in America’s policy room, one that’s run wild and must be stopped by the nation’s next leader.While Trump’s been especially vocal on the topic, he’s far from alone in taking this stand.Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, has also decried the “disastrous trade policies” of the past 25 years.In fact, even Hillary Clinton, who most experts expect to beat Sanders and face Trump in November’s general election, now says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that she, while secretary of state, described as the “gold standard” of trade deals.This is a big shift. For the past 70 years, all presidential hopefuls have held up free trade as key to bringing about prosperity and peace to America and the world.Now, following Trump’s lead, all this year’s candidates are saying Washington’s way of promoting trade has, in actuality, been quite perilous and has undermined American prosperity to the advantage of our trading partners.What did Trump so presciently see?First, he saw the problematic approach to trade policy taken by establishmentarians like Robert Zoelleck, a former World Bank president and deputy secretary of state, who in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this month argued for the TPP, which has yet to be ratified by Congress, by focusing on the impact America’s trade agreements have had on national security.To insiders like Zoelleck, the main purpose of trade and globalization policy is not to enhance the incomes and welfare of ordinary Americans; it’s to shore up allies against Russia and stop the Chinese from doing what is never precisely articulated.This position is held by the very people who uttered nary a whisper when General Electric, rather than investing back home, decided to move its high-tech aviation electronics division to Shanghai through a joint venture with a state-owned Chinese company. These are the people who promoted and profited from the offshoring of millions of American manufacturing jobs in the name of making China a responsible stakeholder in the global economic system.To Trump, Sanders and those who share their view, such an approach is the height of inconsistency.Neoclassical economists and the foreign policy establishment, however, see the nonreciprocal opening of American markets as an allegedly cost-free way of buying friends and persuading countries with tiny economies to host U.S. troops and join us in supporting supposedly critical issues at the United Nations.This approach has long been thought of as cost-free because leading Anglo-American economists — not, mind you, Japanese, Korean, German or Singaporean economists — argued that free trade is always and everywhere a win-win proposition.So, opening American markets to foreign competition, even when it’s been clear the competitors are operating under mercantilist, export-led growth policies, has been said to be a big win for the vast majority of Americans. Of course, it’s been admitted, there will always be a few workers or companies who suffer displacement, but it’s also been promised they’ll be compensated by the vast majority of winners. That’s how it’s been argued, anyway.All this has been based on the counterintuitive concept of comparative advantage, first articulated in 1817 by British economist David Ricardo and elaborated upon in the 1930s by Swedish economists Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin. The theory essentially holds that countries should concentrate on producing what they do best and trade for the rest.What countries produce best, according the theory, is determined by their endowments of land, labor and capital. And therefore, countries like America, with skilled labor and lots of land and capital, ought to produce agricultural and advanced manufactured products and trade those for toys, clothing, and other products from countries with lots of cheap labor. America ought to sell computer chips and airplanes to China in return for T-shirts, underwear and lychees, the theory would say.This all sounded good for a long time, but as noted in the early 1980s by economist Paul Krugman, this theory rested on a host of far-fetched assumptions: fixed exchange rates, no cross-border flows of investment or technology, constant full employment, no cost of entry into or out of business, no government intervention such as Social Security or minimum wages, no unions, and, very importantly, no economies of scale.In other words, the world of free trade theory has always been make-believe, and increasing globalization made it more so.Indeed, in the late 1990s, Ralph Gomory, a former chief scientist at IBM, and William Baumol, a former president of the American Economic Association, demonstrated that in the real world, where many countries and products were experiencing rapid technological change, immense cross-border flows of investment and technology, and frequent fluctuations in economic growth and employment, trade is as likely to be a zero-sum (I win, you lose) proposition as a win-win situation. The outcome of trade all depends on the situation, they concluded.Trump and Sanders probably haven’t read all these analyses. But they have seen that none of the forecasts by Republican or Democratic administrations for new job creation and reduced trade deficits with Japan, China, Korea or other global partners ever came true. For instance, America’s $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico has turned into a $50 billion deficit since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. Instead of shrinking, America’s trade deficit with China — which stood at $80 billion in 2011 — has ballooned to nearly $400 billion. America’s free trade agreement with South Korea has seen U.S. exports decline, imports double and 11,000 jobs quickly lost.It’s hard to deny that Trump and Bernie have been right about trade.Clyde Prestowitz is the founder and president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a nonpartisan public policy organization in Washington. A counselor to the secretary of commerce in the administration of President Ronald Reagan, Prestowitz has been involved in shaping numerous American trade deals and is the author of several books.- See more at: http://m.thedailyworld.com/opinion/columnist/when-it-comes-trade-trump-s-spot#sthash.26eJGWKT.dpuf

The Impact of China's Trade Practices is Real



		6/13/2014
	



		2 Comments
	


 

      A colleague working on his MBA emailed me with questions for his research project. This is my response:"Thank you for your email.  You are correct that China’s abuse of global trade laws has a serious impact on the steel industry.  They do employ a wide range of illegal trade practices to support their export driven manufacturing sector.  This comes directly at the expense of the U.S. steel industry and the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole.  China was allowed entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, after agreeing to abide by the rules of global trade.  Since that time, they have completely disregarded their commitments under the WTO and, as a result, the U.S. has lost over 6 million manufacturing jobs and our trade deficit with China has gone from $83 billion in 2001 to $295 billion, the largest trade imbalance we’ve ever recorded with a single country.For our industry, the impact of China’s trade practices has been a surge in Chinese steel imports, dumped in our market below the cost of production.  Last year, China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in 13 years.  Despite this, China’s steel production increased by 3.1%.  China accounted for 46.3% of world crude steel production last year, far more than the demand of its domestic market.  Steel imports into the United States increased by 16.9% last year.  Imports from China increased by 33.5%.  This import surge was not driven by strong U.S. demand.  Our economic growth continues to be slow and U.S. steel mills are only running at 70% of capacity.  The imports are increasing because subsidized steel from other countries, notably China, is being dumped in our market.  The impacts are real.  RG Steel is selling its assets in bankruptcy and other U.S. mills are on the market. Besides illegal subsidies and export quotas, you should also examine Chinese currency manipulation and China’s state-owned enterprises.  China pegs its currency to the U.S. dollar as opposed to letting the free market determine its value.  By pegging its currency to the dollar, China keeps its currency undervalued by up to as much as 40%.  This undervaluation makes Chinese products cheaper in the U.S. and our products more expensive in China’s market.  This is China’s most potent trade weapon and has been the primary driver of our enormous trade deficit with China. China also has several state-owned enterprises in the steel industry.  State-owned enterprises are not private companies, but government entities that follow government directives.  As a result, American companies are not competing against other private companies, but against foreign governments, which creates major market distortions.  SOEs have advantages that most shareholder-owned companies do not.  They get access to massive and often illegal subsidies like cheap capital from state-owned banks.  They get free land.  Their governments subsidize energy costs and exports.  All these protectionist trade practices come together to feed their growth.To combat these illegal trade practices, the U.S. and other countries must do more to enforce the rules of free trade.  China has to face consequences for breaking the rules.  Nucor has brought several trade cases against China over a variety of steel products and we will bring more.  Their abuse of our open markets must stop.  We will not reinvigorate our manufacturing sector and create the high-paying jobs that support the middle class unless we take strong trade enforcement action.  Also, Congress must pass legislation that labels China a currency manipulator and imposes penalties.  There are solutions to these trade issues, but it requires political will to implement these solutions. I hope this helps you from a macro-level.  As I’ve often said publicly, you can rest assured that we will continue to remain diligent and bring legal challenges against those countries responsible for the flood of imports that is not market driven. It's a very serious issue affects all of our products.  It has traditionally been more so in the long products, rebar and sheet, but also now affects plate.  Until our government steps up and shows leadership on the solutions I mentioned above, we’ll continue to fight, and we’ll continue to win."photo source: chinadaily.com.cm

Here is an item relating to the economic and price impacts of further liberalizing LNG exports, in Australia. Let's keep it here! Please refer to my earlier blogs on this subject! FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                                  CONTACT: Marnie SatterfieldJuly 24, 2014                                                                                                        (202) 223-1420msatterfield@ieca-us.org AUSTRALIAN REPORT – ILLUSTRATES ECONOMIC DANGERS OF UNFETTERED LNG EXPORTS A July 2014 report entitled, “Gas Market Transformations – Economic Consequences for the Manufacturing Sector,[3]” illustrates the impact of escalating natural gas prices in Australia due to LNG exports driven by OPEC cartel crude oil LNG-linked prices.  “Even though Australia is the third largest producer of natural gas in the world, Australian natural gas prices have tripled in response to the significant LNG exports,” said Paul N. Cicio, President of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA) . “Like the U.S., the Australian natural gas market was once a “free market” whereby domestic supply and demand determined the price. Now, because of LNG exports, natural gas suppliers have ‘market power’ and can dictate higher prices.”    According to the report, Australia will experience the following impacts due to rising natural gas prices: n  Australia’s manufacturing output will diminish by $118 billion over the next seven yearsn  14,600 manufacturing jobs will be lostn  The mining sector will diminish by $34 billion and the agricultural sector by $4.5 billion Australian manufacturers are closing their doors and power companies are taking action to switch from natural gas to coal. The cost of home heating and cooling has also soared.                                The Industrial Energy Consumers of America is a nonpartisan association of leading manufacturing companies with $1.0 trillion in annual sales, over 2,900 facilities nationwide, and with more than 1.4 million employees worldwide. It is an organization created to promote the interests of manufacturing companies through advocacy and collaboration for which the availability, use and cost of energy, power or feedstock play a significant role in their ability to compete in domestic and world markets. IECA membership represents a diverse set of industries including: chemical, plastics, steel, iron ore, aluminum, paper, food processing, fertilizer, insulation, glass, industrial gases, pharmaceutical, building products, brewing, independent oil refining, and cement.

China attacks USA.  Wake-up America: A continuation 



		7/25/2014
	



		2 Comments
	


 

      We have discussed the fact that we are in a war, a trade war with China and have been for the last 20 years and we are losing big! The trade data and trade deficit, both annual and cumulative, is staggering! The job losses in manufacturing number over 6,000,000! The negative impact on our economy has been the main culprit in an abysmal 1.7% growth rate since 2000! The message here today is tied to doing what is necessary and right to stimulate a stronger economy and greater job creation here at home and also around the globe. not just in one country. The world is in the same war and are just as ignorant of the facts.Today I would like to introduce you to the game plan behind their attack on our economic future. It is all spelled out in the book "Unrestricted Warfare: China's Master Plan to Destroy America" or at the very least - do what we have to for China and to hell with everyone else!A good friend and Champion recently wrote me and reminded me of our past efforts to get the powers that be in Washington to understand what was going on and why and how our leaders basically turned a blind eye on the trade war facing us... ..."Remember when I commented that the folks at USTR (US Trade Representative) we dealt with in the steel industry had never heard of it, one took the challenge to read it and she couldn’t get the appointed 'leaders' to do likewise?  We deal in a vacuum of understanding when dealing with our adversaries.  Kum Ba Ya just doesn’t cut it in today’s world. Now if only 'everyone' would read the most important document explaining the Chinese strategy we could mount an effective counter balance and actively engage in this Economic Trade War.As an example, one of the biggest weapons in their arsenal and game-plan is to manipulate their currency. It results in a huge illegal subsidy of ~40-50%. Here is the quote in 'Unrestricted Warfare' relating to currency.""For example, in this era of economic integration, if some economically powerful company wants to attack another country's economy while simultaneously attacking its defenses, it cannot rely completely on the use of ready-made means such as economic blockades and trade sanctions, or military threats and arms embargoes. Instead, it must adjust its own financial strategy, use currency revaluation or devaluation as primary, and combine means ... to make financial turbulence and economic crisis appear in the targeted country or area, weakening its overall power, including its military strength."This must become a concern that we all share not just a few! We need to wake up America to this economic war being waged against us or...........Some people will say this is just 'China bashing', a term they love to use instead of taking the time to educate themselves or just because it is in their financial, geopolitical, or ideological interests to use this term as a 'put-down'. That is and will be their shame and we will not be deterred in our efforts to educate. Trading partners....I think not... No, I know not.....America Wake Up!

My Thoughts on China



		6/4/2014

      This article was printed in American Metals Market last year.  My thoughts regarding China haven't changed.NEW YORK — As much as 70 percent of today’s global steel industry is owned by government entities, distorting the basic fundamentals of a market-driven economy and leading to massive structural oversupply on a worldwide scale, according to Nucor Corp. executive chairman Daniel R. DiMicco."One of the greatest banes of our industry for a long, long time—decades—has been state-owned steel industries. They’re not market driven; they’re politically driven. ... And politically driven translates to massive overcapacity," DiMicco said in a keynote address at the Steel Success Strategies XXVIII conference in New York, sponsored by AMM and World Steel Dynamics Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.Between 65 and 70 percent of the global steel sector is controlled by state or national governments, he said, noting that such state-owned steelmaking companies are neither low-cost nor market driven, resulting in a glut of subsidized capacity with no home but the world export market. "Unfortunately, we in the United States are the world’s dumping ground, including for rebar and for other products," DiMicco said."According to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates, there is global demand for about 1.5 billion tonnes of steel per year, but that’s far below the 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion tonnes of capacity fighting to supply that demand, he said.Much of that overcapacity is coming from China, but Turkey and other major steelmaking nations relying on a major export strategy are also to blame, DiMicco said."No nation should build 300 million tonnes of excess capacity they don’t need, no matter what your growth trajectory is, particularly when you can build steel mills as fast as (the Chinese) can. This shouldn’t be the case anywhere in the world. A developing nation? Yes, build a steel industry. But don’t build one that depends on exports to survive," he said."Build it to create jobs in your country (and) drive economic growth internally, but don’t be building it so you export 20 million of 35 million tonnes of your production. That’s ridiculous," DiMicco said, citing estimated export figures from Turkey. "That is basically flaunting and making a laughing stock out of the concept of market-driven economies and free trade."The solution, he said, is going to require pressure from the global steel sector and key governments around the world."To get ourselves out of this mess ... it’s going to take enlightened leadership. It’s going to take a global community that says enough is enough. The distortions are too great; it’s time to correct (it)," he said.DiMicco’s message to the global steel sector is clear: "Stop exporting your overcapacity. There’s too much in the world. Take your medicine at home (and) get rid of your antiquated, excess capacity of which there are hundreds of millions of tonnes.""The challenge in particular for China is you’ve done great things. You’ve done things that no other country in the world has done. A lot of good things, miraculous things in what you’ve built. But you’ve overdone it," he added. "Please get your act together and become part of the global community in a non-threatening way."

Infrastructure, Jobs, Economic Growth.... Where is the Leadership???



		7/17/2014
	



		5 Comments
	


 

      For the last 6 years we have been pointing out to EVERYONE in Washington the need for job creation. One of the "Right in your Face" solutions that matched a huge need to modernize our massive transportation infrastructure to replace the millions in job losses that occurred in all segments of the Construction and related industries, due to the Great Recession. Taking such action would also have created many, many jobs in Manufacturing and Services of all kinds. However, the Democrats chose not to when they controlled both Houses of Congress and the Presidency, instead focusing on "arguably" important issues, but not the crisis they were made out to be, like Cap&Trade and Universal healthcare. Then the Republicans focused on the budget deficit versus job creation so they have not acted to drive the rebuilding of our infrastructure either!!! The budget deficit and debt issues are no doubt of serious concern to all of us. BUT, just as with the Democrats focus on "Man-made global warming...read Cap & Trade.....read Climate Change"and universal healthcare....read Obamacare, the R's failed to focus on the real crisis at hand....JOB CREATION and Economic Stimulus! Any good, let alone great leader knows the difference between long term problem solving and immediate Crisis solving....the reality was and is that good/great leadership is not present in Washington, hence they don't and didn't!So here we are still with the need to create 25-30 million new jobs over the next 5-7 years and still no recognition, in concrete action, of the TRUE crisis before us...JOB CREATION and STRONG economic growth. The anemic growth in both is proof of the failure in Leadership.One very important point to make about the article below, which focuses on gas tax increase to generate funds for infrastructure work, which we should support for "part of the funding needs", is this. The State governments and Federal governments are currently using the taxes being raised today for infrastructure for other purposes.....debt reduction....general funding needs....not infrastructure. This must stop immediately if an increase in gas taxes is to have the desired impact on Job Creation and a strong economic stimulus. THIS IS A MUST HAVE as part of any increase in the gas tax!!!!AMERICA'S CHALLENGE--WAKE-UP!!!!! We all must work Together to be Champions and Activists!  If we don't change the focus in Washington to economic growth and job creation, already 6 years behind, the other "long term" issues we see as important will never really get dealt with! How can we all not be for Job Creation and Real Growth in our Economy Today???Let all your elected officials, both State and Federal know what they need to do. NOW!Dan    Highway Transportation Fund needs a permanent and simple fixBy Editorial Board July 12 at 6:37 PMWITH THE Highway Trust Fund running dangerously low on cash, threatening infrastructure projects across the country in the height of construction season, members of Congress seem to have settled on their latest short-term gimmick to pay for the country’s roads and rails. The only question left seems to be when they will try to do something better. The answer should be: immediately.Without new funding, the Transportation Department will begin slashing highway payouts tostates starting Aug. 1. Few want to see that, but lawmakers have been perpetually unable to fund the nation’s transportation budget responsibly. So, depressingly if predictably, withanother funding crisis looming, members of Congress seem to agree on exploiting an arcane accounting trick called pension smoothing, which could reduce the security of private pensions but would result in more federal revenue over a decade. That decade’s worth of revenue will pay for several months of transportation spending.This budget gimmickry is distasteful for several reasons, starting with the fact that the plan spends money now, over the course of less than a year, that the government will make back over 10 years. The idea is to give Congress more time to sort out a permanent solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s perpetual funding shortfalls. But lawmakers don’t need more time; they need more spine.The straightforward policy, the one on which the Highway Trust Fund historically has been based, is to raise the gas tax to keep up with inflation and infrastructure needs. This model is fair and efficient, demanding that those who use the roads pay for them. As a sustainable and predictable source of revenue, a gas tax of sufficient size also would eliminate uncertainty about the level and source of government transportation funding.Congress could end the transportation funding crunch by adopting a bipartisan plan from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). The proposal would raise the gas tax by 12 cents per gallon over two years, and it would index the tax to inflation. The last time Congress raised the gas tax, in 1993, it failed to peg the tax to inflation, which is largely why lawmakers are scrounging for money now.Lawmakers should pass the Corker-Murphy plan. Instead, they are fighting over when they will have to consider the long-term transportation funding issue. Many Republicans want to push off the decision-making until next spring. Many Democrats want to have the debate this December. If lawmakers aren’t willing to accept the obvious funding plan in front of them before the November elections, they should do so immediately afterward, when the political atmosphere may be more conducive to doing the right thing. More important, there’s no reason to make the country wait any longer for funding certainty.

Looking for a Good Job? There is Much That Remains Undone!



		9/17/2014

This article was sent to me by my friend Denny Boyd, it points out how much work has yet to be done to create good paying jobs for all, especially our young adults and how much has not been done. We need strong leadership and action not sound bites for re election campaigning.Our economy and jobless are crying out to become a nation that creates, makes, and builds things again.....the true wealth creation engine for all Americans not just Wall Street!We have discussed this many times before; the solutions are in 1) correcting/balancing our trade deficit in manufactured goods and services by stopping trade mercantilism and focusing on rules based free trade and holding our trading partners accountable, 2) rebuilding our infrastructure through meaningful investments that payback several fold, 3) undoing excessive regulations on business that are destroying our global competitiveness, 4) using our new found energy resources here at home to create more good paying jobs/careers and rebuild our global competitiveness. Being sure to not allow a " free-for-all" exporting of these resources but a balanced approach, 5) being sure that government policies are designed to encourage people to work not provide disincentives to work, 6) get our tax system globally competitive and job creating instead of chasing jobs overseas. For those that incorrectly blame a skills gap, I say yes we always have a skills gap as innovation changes the world we are in but today's jobs crisis is not skills gap based, it is based on not creating jobs for those who were gainfully employed prior to 2009 with skills enough and lost their jobs. This failure is rooted in ignoring the opportunities we had in spades to put them back to work rebuilding our infrastructure and making /building things, and the services that support all of it! Just what they were doing prior to the economy crashing. It time our leaders woke up our left town and it is up to us to hold them accountable. Don't be swayed by false and hollow sound bites, but demand substance from people of real experience not personality. Leave personality to Hollywood and the talking heads in the 'press' not to building a globally strong and competitive economy here at home. Don't be swayed by the happenings on Wall Street which have more to do with 1) low interest rates driving investors/Americans to look for better returns; 2) being the prettiest ugly man/woman at the global economic dance; 3) companies buying back their own stock; 4) merger/acquisition mania brought about by painfully slow growth in the economy and easy money looking for a home/returns.Nothing necessarily wrong with good times on Wall Street but without a dynamic growing economy it does not reach all Americans in their paycheck or job aspirations .America Wake-Up and do it Together.Dan          Catherine Rampell: Many life Milestones are Out of Millennials' Reach (LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS)By Catherine Rampell Opinion writer September 15We want to move out. We want to own our home. We want to marry. We want to work.The problem is, many of us can’t.America’s young adults have gotten a lot of flak for missing many of the milestones that earlier generations checked off with ease.We aren’t getting even entry-level jobs, which could enable us to pay our own bills. Not only are we not buying houses, many of us aren’t renting, either: About a third of millennials still live with their parents, earning us the irksome epithet “boomerang generation” — a play on “boomer generation,” the presumed victim here.We’re hanging out in our beleaguered parents’ basements rather than marrying and starting legally recognized unions of our own. Marriage rates have skidded downward, with a little more than a quarter of 18- to 35-year-olds ball-and-chained in 2012, compared with about 40 percent at the dawn of the millennium, according to calculations from the president’s Council of Economic Advisers. Partly as a result, more than half of the country is presently single, the first time this has been the case since the government began keeping track in 1976. (Singlehood hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to reproduce, of course.)To some, this arrested development is evidence of a prolonged adolescence and a rejection of self-sufficiency, perhaps encouraged by indulgent “helicopter parenting.” According to a recent ­Reason-Rupe survey, about three­quarters of America’s young adults consider millennials to be “responsible” and “hard-working,” while just half of older adults agree. If character isn’t the issue, perhaps it’s misplaced preferences: We millennials have set aside the ideals of an “ownership society” in favor of the hippy-dippy values of a “sharing economy.” We rent, borrow or share our textbooks, cars and evendinner leftovers, so why would we bother buying a home or permanently attaching ourselves to a single romantic partner?Recent data, though, suggest that these standard, American-dream-style signposts still retain an incredibly strong hold over young people’s desires and aspirations. What’s changed is that basic goals such as getting married, having a secure job and owning a home have drifted further out of reach.Even as marriage rates have plummeted — particularly for the young and the less educated — Gallup survey data show that young singles very much hope to get hitched. Of Americans age 18 to 34, only about 9 percent have both never been married and say they do not ever want to marry.“Although there is now a growing class divide in who gets and stays married in America, there is virtually no divide in the aspiration to marry,” says W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. “It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor, white, black or Hispanic. Most Americans are married or would like to marry. The challenge, then, facing the United States is bridging the gap between the nearly universal aspiration to marry and the growing inability of poor and working-class Americans to access marriage.”On to housing. Young Americans are substantially less likely to own homes than their counterparts a generation or two ago, with their homeownership rates reaching record lows this year.But survey after survey shows that young people would love to be deed-owners. Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey, for example, asks respondents whether they think it’s better to own or rent to achieve various goals (such as feeling safe, building wealth, feeling engaged in their communities, etc.). On almost every point, young adults — just like their older brethren — say that owning is better. The vast majority of millennials also say they’ll buy at some point, if they haven’t already, and they believe that the best reasons for owning are not financial but the “broader security and lifestyle benefits of homeownership.”So what’s keeping young people from buying, even as mortgage rates appear relatively cheap, and from marrying, even though possible mates are plentiful?Economic opportunity has a lot to do with both. Unemployment rates for the youngest adults remain high, and they look far worse when you include people who aren’t actually looking for work but still say they want a job. Student loan debt also seems to be weighing on young people’s ability to buy, as documented by the economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among others.Perhaps preferences for these kinds of life milestones will eventually change, too, as norms evolve out of economic necessity. But in the meantime, don’t malign millennials for “rejecting” milestones that remain out of their reach.

ABSOLUTE MUST-READ!

Last week I posted on this Blog that...." If it's not the Truth then it's a Lie". Well the must read article by Mort Zuckerman in today's WSJ is the TRUTH.......and he speaks to the the BIG 'Lie'!Those of you that have been following this blog and heard me speak over the last 6 years will recognize the message and the fact which speak to the 'LIE', and the spin....WAKE-UP AMERICA!!!!Let's do it Together!Dan          WSJ OPINIONThe Full-Time Scandal of Part-Time AmericaFewer than half of U.S. adults are working full time. Why? Slow growth and the perverse incentives of ObamaCare.By MORTIMER ZUCKERMANJuly 13, 2014 6:47 p.m. ETThere has been a distinctive odor of hype lately about the national jobs report for June. Most people will have the impression that the 288,000 jobs created last month were full-time. Not so.The Obama administration and much of the media trumpeting the figure overlooked that the government numbers didn't distinguish between new part-time and full-time jobs. Full-time jobs last month plunged by 523,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What has increased are part-time jobs.Part time jobs soared by about 800,000 to more than 28 million. Just think of all those Americans working part time, no doubt glad to have the work but also contending with lower pay, diminished benefits and little job security.On July 2 President Obama boasted that the jobs report "showed the sixth straight month of job growth" in the private economy. "Make no mistake," he said. "We are headed in the right direction." What he failed to mention is that only 47.7% of adults in the U.S. are working full time. Yes, the percentage of unemployed has fallen, but that's worth barely a Bronx cheer. It reflects the bleak fact that 2.4 million Americans have become discouraged and dropped out of the workforce. You might as well say that the unemployment rate would be zero if everyone quit looking for work.Last month involuntary part-timers swelled to 7.5 million, compared with 4.4 million in 2007. Way too many adults now depend on the low-wage, part-time jobs that teenagers would normally fill. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had it right in March when she said: "The existence of such a large pool of partly unemployed workers is a sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate."There are a number of reasons for our predicament, most importantly a historically low growth rate for an economic "recovery." Gross domestic product growth in 2013 was a feeble 1.9%, and it fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9% in the first quarter of 2014.But there is one clear political contribution to the dismal jobs trend. Many employers cut workers' hours to avoid the Affordable Care Act's mandate to provide health insurance to anyone working 30 hours a week or more. The unintended consequence of President Obama's "signature legislation"? Fewer full-time workers. In many cases two people are working the same number of hours that one had previously worked.Since mid-2007 the U.S. population has grown by 17.2 million, according to the Census Bureau, but we have 374,000 fewer jobs since a November 2007 peak and are 10 million jobs shy of where we should be. It is particularly upsetting that our current high unemployment is concentrated in the oldest and youngest workers. Older workers have been phased out as new technologies improve productivity, and young adults who lack skills are struggling to find entry-level jobs with advancement opportunities. In the process, they are losing critical time to develop workplace habits, contacts and new skills.Most Americans wouldn't call this an economic recovery. Yes, we're not technically in a recession as the recovery began in mid-2009, but high-wage industries have lost a million positions since 2007. Low-paying jobs are gaining and now account for 44% of all employment growth since employment hit bottom in February 2010, with by far the most growth—3.8 million jobs—in low-wage industries. The number of long-term unemployed remains at historically high levels, standing at more than three million in June. The proportion of Americans in the labor force is at a 36-year low, 62.8%, down from 66% in 2008.Part-time jobs are no longer the domain of the young. Many are taken by adults in their prime working years—25 to 54 years of age—and many are single men and women without high-school diplomas. Why is this happening? It can't all be attributed to the unforeseen consequences of the Affordable Care Act. The longer workers have been out of a job, the more likely they are to take a part-time job to make ends meet.The result: Faith in the American dream is eroding fast. The feeling is that the rules aren't fair and the system has been rigged in favor of business and against the average person. The share of financial compensation and outputs going to labor has dropped to less than 60% today from about 65% before 1980.Why haven't increases in labor productivity translated into higher household income in private employment? In part because of very low rates of capital spending on new plant and equipment over the past five years. In the 1960s, only one in 20 American men between the ages of 25 and 54 was not working. According to former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, in 10 years that number will be one in seven.The lack of breadwinners working full time is a burgeoning disaster. There are 48 million people in the U.S. in low-wage jobs.Those workers won't be able to spend what is necessary in an economy that is mostly based on consumer spending, and this will put further pressure on growth. What we have is a very high unemployment rate, a slow recovery and across-the-board wage stagnation (except for the top few percent). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost 91 million people over age 16 aren't working, a record high. When Barack Obama became president, that figure was nearly 10 million lower.The great American job machine is spluttering. We are going through the weakest post-recession recovery the U.S. has ever experienced, with growth half of what it was after four previous recessions. And that's despite the most expansive monetary policy in history and the largest fiscal stimulus since World War II.That is why the June numbers are so distressing. Five years after the Great Recession, more than 24 million working-age Americans remain jobless, working part-time involuntarily or having left the workforce. We are not in the middle of a recovery. We are in the middle of a muddle-through, and there's no point in pretending that the sky is blue when so many millions can attest to dark clouds.Mr. Zuckerman is chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News & World Report.

If It's Not The Truth, It's a Lie

      The Exaggerations Continue Regarding the Health of the Economy. Remember what happens in the stock market is not a good gage of the economy when interest rates are so low. Why? Because investors have little other choice to hopefully get good returns. The cheap money also drives acquisition/merger/takeover activity, and this is going on in spades. Read....extreme behavior that leads us to the failures of the last decade.The economy grew by 4% in the second quarter after shrinking by -2.1% in the first quarter. This gives us a whopping 1.7-1.9% growth rate thru the first 6 months of 2014. However, you would think the economy was on fire according to the articles and headlines of the last few days." GDP SURGES.....Business Insider; US economy back on track.....Reuters; Fed boosts view of economy....WSJ; etc...."Add to that the average growth rate of the economy since 2000 being 1.7% and you get.....try a Real Unemployment rate of over 15% not 6.1% and a no growth to slow growth economy that is leaving far too many Americans behind..... the 8-Ball.....the Middle Class becoming the lower class....and income disparity growing.Some politicians will try to say look how good we are doing and our plans for the economy are bearing fruit....yeah-rotten, decaying fruit.We have talked repeatedly about what the solutions to this economic malaise are. I wish I could tell you we are on the right track but we are not. Our policies on global trade are mostly a failure; our government is out of control with massive amounts of new, economy and job chocking regulations; our tax policies are non-competitive and driving our corporations offshore;  our infrastructure is failing at a frightening rate ( witness the huge water main break in California wasting 20+millions of gallons of precious water in a severe drought state where they argue over a few gallons wasted on lawn watering); unfortunately I could go on and on.We are still a great country, but we don't need to hide the truth behind political rhetoric and misleading information.Continue to educate yourselves! Re-visit some of the earlier messages on this blog, in particular my presentation in New Orleans......Read the articles.....look at the "Like-minded" section. If you have questions, ask them.You know what is going on in your communities, towns, and neighborhoods. How tough it is to find good paying jobs for family members, friends, graduates. We are 6 years since the collapse and 7 years from the start of this Great Recession and we are way too far behind where we should be and need to be.It is up to you America to see through to the truth and hold your elected officials accountable, particularly those in leadership positions. Time to put people in these roles who tell the truth not what they think you want to hear. There are no free lunches to cure what ails us, just hard work and accurate and realistic views of our problems and their solutions. If someone is promising to take care of you, and that does not include hard work and sacrifice...run from them not to them. They are friends in name only!Let's do it together,Dan

Must read of the day.......America, the real unemployment rate is over 15% NOT 6.1%, Wake-Up and let your Congressional Officials and the President know, that you know! It's way past time to hold them accountable.    Real Unemployment Rate is at Least 18 Percent Peter MoriciFriday, the Labor Department is expected to report the economy added 235,000 jobs in July, and the unemployment rate remained steady at 6.1 percent, but that hardly tells the story.The jobless rate may be down from its recession peak of 10 percent, but much of this results from adults, discouraged by the lack of decent job openings, have quit altogether. They are neither employed nor looking for work.Only about half of the drop in the adult participation rate may be attributed to the Baby Boom generation reaching retirement age. Lacking adequate resources to retire, a larger percentage of adults over 65 are working than before the recession.Many Americans who would like full time jobs are stuck in part-time positions, because businesses can hire desirable part-time workers to supplement a core of permanent, full-time employees, but at lower wages. And Obamacare’s employer health insurance mandates will not apply to workers on the job less than 30 hours a week.Since 2000, Congress has enhanced the earned income tax credit, and expanded programs that provide direct benefits to low-income workers, including food stamps, Medicaid, Obamacare, and rent and mortgage assistance.Virtually all phase as family incomes rise, either by securing higher hourly pay or working more hours, and impose an effective marginal tax rate as high as 50 percent.  Consequently, these programs discourage work and skills acquisition, and encourage single parents and one partner in two adult households not to work. Often, these motivate single people to work only part-time.Undocumented immigrants face more difficulties accessing these programs, and lax immigration enforcement permits them to openly take jobs that government benefits discourage low-income Americans from accepting.Employers can, intentionally or unintentionally, abuse the H-1B visa program, which permit businesses to employ foreign workers when qualified Americans are unavailable. Americans may be overlooked, because they demand higher wages, or are not networked with immigrants that are already employed in technical and managerial positions.The economy has created only about 6 million new jobs during the Bush-Obama years, whereas the comparable figure during the Reagan-Clinton period was about 40 million. A recent study by the Center for Immigration Studies indicates that virtually all the new jobs created since 2000 went to immigrants, whereas none were created for native-born Americans.Adding in discouraged adults who say they would begin looking for work if conditions were better, those working part-time but say they want full time work, and the effects of immigration, the unemployment rate becomes about 15 percent—and that is a lower bound estimate.Many young people are being duped both by unscrupulous for profit, post-secondary institutions—as well as accredited colleges and universities with low admission standards—to enroll in useless programs. They would likely be in the labor force now but for easy access to federally sponsored loans and will end up heavily in debt.Adding in these students, the real unemployment rate among U.S. citizens and permanent residents is at least 18 percent.Since 2000, GDP growth has averaged 1.7 per year, whereas during the Reagan-Clinton years, it was 3.4 percent. The reluctance of both Presidents Bush and Obama to confront Chinese protectionism and currency manipulation and open up offshore oil for development have created a huge trade deficit that sends consumer demand, growth and jobs abroad.New business regulations, more burdensome than are necessary to accomplish legitimate consumer protection and environmental objectives, exacerbate these problems.All of this suppresses wages except for the most skilled and talented workers.No surprise, average family income, adjusted for inflation has fallen from about $55,600 in 2007 to $51,000 even as the gap between families at the bottom and top widens.Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, national columnist and five-time winner of the MarketWatch best forecaster award.

Infrastructure, Jobs, Economic Growth.... Where is the Leadership???

      For the last 6 years we have been pointing out to EVERYONE in Washington the need for job creation. One of the "Right in your Face" solutions that matched a huge need to modernize our massive transportation infrastructure to replace the millions in job losses that occurred in all segments of the Construction and related industries, due to the Great Recession. Taking such action would also have created many, many jobs in Manufacturing and Services of all kinds. However, the Democrats chose not to when they controlled both Houses of Congress and the Presidency, instead focusing on "arguably" important issues, but not the crisis they were made out to be, like Cap&Trade and Universal healthcare. Then the Republicans focused on the budget deficit versus job creation so they have not acted to drive the rebuilding of our infrastructure either!!! The budget deficit and debt issues are no doubt of serious concern to all of us. BUT, just as with the Democrats focus on "Man-made global warming...read Cap & Trade.....read Climate Change"and universal healthcare....read Obamacare, the R's failed to focus on the real crisis at hand....JOB CREATION and Economic Stimulus! Any good, let alone great leader knows the difference between long term problem solving and immediate Crisis solving....the reality was and is that good/great leadership is not present in Washington, hence they don't and didn't!So here we are still with the need to create 25-30 million new jobs over the next 5-7 years and still no recognition, in concrete action, of the TRUE crisis before us...JOB CREATION and STRONG economic growth. The anemic growth in both is proof of the failure in Leadership.One very important point to make about the article below, which focuses on gas tax increase to generate funds for infrastructure work, which we should support for "part of the funding needs", is this. The State governments and Federal governments are currently using the taxes being raised today for infrastructure for other purposes.....debt reduction....general funding needs....not infrastructure. This must stop immediately if an increase in gas taxes is to have the desired impact on Job Creation and a strong economic stimulus. THIS IS A MUST HAVE as part of any increase in the gas tax!!!!AMERICA'S CHALLENGE--WAKE-UP!!!!! We all must work Together to be Champions and Activists!  If we don't change the focus in Washington to economic growth and job creation, already 6 years behind, the other "long term" issues we see as important will never really get dealt with! How can we all not be for Job Creation and Real Growth in our Economy Today???Let all your elected officials, both State and Federal know what they need to do. NOW!Dan    Highway Transportation Fund needs a permanent and simple fixBy Editorial Board July 12 at 6:37 PMWITH THE Highway Trust Fund running dangerously low on cash, threatening infrastructure projects across the country in the height of construction season, members of Congress seem to have settled on their latest short-term gimmick to pay for the country’s roads and rails. The only question left seems to be when they will try to do something better. The answer should be: immediately.Without new funding, the Transportation Department will begin slashing highway payouts tostates starting Aug. 1. Few want to see that, but lawmakers have been perpetually unable to fund the nation’s transportation budget responsibly. So, depressingly if predictably, withanother funding crisis looming, members of Congress seem to agree on exploiting an arcane accounting trick called pension smoothing, which could reduce the security of private pensions but would result in more federal revenue over a decade. That decade’s worth of revenue will pay for several months of transportation spending.This budget gimmickry is distasteful for several reasons, starting with the fact that the plan spends money now, over the course of less than a year, that the government will make back over 10 years. The idea is to give Congress more time to sort out a permanent solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s perpetual funding shortfalls. But lawmakers don’t need more time; they need more spine.The straightforward policy, the one on which the Highway Trust Fund historically has been based, is to raise the gas tax to keep up with inflation and infrastructure needs. This model is fair and efficient, demanding that those who use the roads pay for them. As a sustainable and predictable source of revenue, a gas tax of sufficient size also would eliminate uncertainty about the level and source of government transportation funding.Congress could end the transportation funding crunch by adopting a bipartisan plan from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). The proposal would raise the gas tax by 12 cents per gallon over two years, and it would index the tax to inflation. The last time Congress raised the gas tax, in 1993, it failed to peg the tax to inflation, which is largely why lawmakers are scrounging for money now.Lawmakers should pass the Corker-Murphy plan. Instead, they are fighting over when they will have to consider the long-term transportation funding issue. Many Republicans want to push off the decision-making until next spring. Many Democrats want to have the debate this December. If lawmakers aren’t willing to accept the obvious funding plan in front of them before the November elections, they should do so immediately afterward, when the political atmosphere may be more conducive to doing the right thing. More important, there’s no reason to make the country wait any longer for funding certainty.

John J. Ferriola To Be Named Nucor CEO Effective January 1, 2013, Daniel R. DiMicco Continues As Executive Chairman

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 16, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Daniel R. DiMicco, who in more than 12 years as Chief Executive Officer led Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) through one of its most explosive and profitable growth periods and an industry-leading total shareholder return of 463.9%, announced today that he is passing this privilege and responsibility on to current President and Chief Operating Officer, John J. Ferriola.  Ferriola will follow DiMicco as CEO effective January 1, 2013.
DiMicco, 62, who served as Nucor's CEO longer than anyone since founder Ken Iverson, took over as Nucor's leader in September 2000, near the start of an economic slump that radically restructured the steel industry in the United States and abroad. DiMicco will remain with Nucor as Executive Chairman.  
Peter C. Browning, Nucor's lead independent director, said, "Dan DiMicco has been one of the nation's outstanding CEOs. I believe one of his most remarkable and lasting achievements was his ability to retain and strengthen Nucor's unique culture, even as Nucor's strategy evolved. One of the first things he did as CEO was to visit every Nucor division to talk with Nucor teammates nationwide. While sales rose nearly five-fold and the number of divisions jumped, Dan kept every teammate focused on the Nucor core principles of Safety, Teamwork, Integrity, Personal Responsibility, Performance, Continual Improvement and Profitability." 
John Ferriola has stepped repeatedly into roles of increasing responsibility as part of Nucor's succession planning. An electrical engineer by training, Ferriola began his career with Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1974. He joined Nucor in 1992 as manager of maintenance and engineering at the Jewett, Texas bar mill. 
Through his first decade with the company, Ferriola served as general manager at three divisions: Vulcraft Texas in Grapeland, the bar mill in Norfolk, Nebraska, and the sheet mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was named Executive Vice President in 2002, then Chief Operating Officer of Steelmaking Operations in 2007. In January 2011, the Board of Directors appointed him Nucor's President and Chief Operating Officer and elected him to the Board.
"I am honored to be given the opportunity to lead the tremendous team we've assembled," Ferriola said. "We have many challenges in front of us, as we continue to work safely and take care of our customers. I am extremely excited about the impressive work being done by our team to significantly grow Nucor's earnings platform well into the future."
"This announcement reflects the thoughtful, planned transition of leadership at Nucor," Browning said. "John's appointment as President in 2011 provided the opportunity for John and Dan to work together even more closely the past two years, laying the groundwork for a seamless change in leadership." 
DiMicco said, "Nucor couldn't be in better hands. I'm very confident in the ability of John and the rest of our management team to take on our current and future challenges and to lead the company's continual growth in the coming years. For the Board and me, it has been absolutely critical for the next Nucor CEO to come from within, and nothing brings me greater satisfaction than for John to be CEO going forward.
"As Executive Chairman, I look forward to continuing to work with and provide strong support to the executive team led by John in the areas of corporate growth, strategic succession planning and Nucor's efforts to promote a strong, vibrant manufacturing base."
Under DiMicco, Nucor developed a five-point growth plan designed to strengthen and diversify Nucor's earnings power in both the peaks and troughs of the steel industry's business cycle. From September 2000 through the end of 2011, Nucor's total return to shareholders was 463.9%, dwarfing the returns of both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (4.3%) and the S&P Steel Industry Group Index (173.9%).
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine ranked Nucor the nation's No. 1 company, based on sales growth and return on investment. In the coming years, Nucor and Dan DiMicco made three additional appearances on the BusinessWeek 50 list. Harvard Business Review included DiMicco in its 2010 top 100 list of The Best Performing CEOs in the World, and in 2011, he was named to Industry Week magazine's Manufacturing Hall of Fame.
As always, DiMicco would be the first to tell you these are all Nucor team awards and not possible without their continued successes and support.

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]

All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.

Daniel R. DiMicco To Retire As Executive Chairman Of Nucor; John J. Ferriola Named Chairman Effective January 1, 2014


CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Daniel R. DiMicco has announced that he is retiring from the Board of Directors of Nucor (NYSE:  NUE) and from his position as Executive Chairman on December 31, 2013.  In appreciation for his distinguished and exemplary service to Nucor as CEO, Chairman and Executive Chairman of the Company, the Board of Directors announced that they have bestowed upon DiMicco the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus. 
Nucor's Board of Directors also announced that John J. Ferriola, who currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, will become the Chairman of the Board effective January 1, 2014.  
DiMicco served as Nucor's CEO longer than anyone since founder Ken Iverson.  DiMicco served as Executive Chairman of Nucor since January 2013.  Previously, he served as Chairman of Nucor from May 2006 to December 2012, Chief Executive Officer from September 2000 to December 2012 and President from September 2000 to December 2010.  DiMicco also served as Vice Chairman of Nucor from June 2001 to May 2006, Executive Vice President from 1999 to 2000 and Vice President from 1992 to 1999.  Since joining Nucor in 1982, DiMicco has worked in a wide variety of roles at all levels of the Company.  
DiMicco became CEO near the start of an economic slump that radically restructured the steel industry in the United States and abroad.  Under his leadership, Nucor's total shareholder return growth of 720% was almost four times greater than the total return of the S&P Steel Group Index and was 28 times greater than the S&P's total return.  During his tenure, DiMicco and his team successfully executed a multi-prong growth strategy for the Company that included optimization of existing operations, growth through acquisitions, greenfield growth, international growth through joint ventures and expansion of control over raw materials.  Prior to DiMicco becoming CEO, Nucor had grown almost entirely via greenfield projects.  With DiMicco's leadership, Nucor pursued acquisitions as a cost-effective alternative avenue for growth and successfully integrated the acquired companies into the Nucor culture.  While he was CEO, he also successfully developed and executed a robust succession plan.  DiMicco's contributions and influence extend beyond Nucor to his efforts to restore America's manufacturing base and to his work in Washington.  
Raymond J. Milchovich, Nucor's lead independent director, said, "On behalf of the Nucor board, I would like to recognize Dan's remarkable career.  As Chairman and CEO, Dan has lead Nucor through a period of transformative change from which all our constituencies have and will continue to benefit.  We wish Dan and his family many years of health and good fortune."
DiMicco said, "One of my most important and satisfying contributions to Nucor is that my successor, John Ferriola, is home grown and the best in the business for the opportunity to lead Nucor and its teammates to its best years ever!  He has my complete support and confidence that he will succeed in this endeavor.  

"I have been truly blessed and privileged to be a part of a great organization with a truly unique and 'best in class' culture like Nucor for over 31 years. I owe my success to all those in my life who have believed in and supported me from the time I entered the world and who continue to do so today, from my parents and family to my teammates.  I want to thank our Board for their support and for the honorary title of Nucor's Chairman Emeritus.  It is an honor that I will forever treasure as I will always consider myself part of this great Nucor team."

John Ferriola has stepped repeatedly into roles of increasing responsibility as part of Nucor's succession planning.  An electrical engineer by training, Ferriola joined Nucor in 1992 as manager of maintenance and engineering at the Jewett, Texas bar mill.  Through his first decade with the company, Ferriola served as general manager at three divisions: Vulcraft Texas in Grapeland, the bar mill in Norfolk, Nebraska, and the sheet mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana.  He was named Vice President in 1996, Executive Vice President in 2002, and Chief Operating Officer of Steelmaking Operations in 2007. In January 2011, the Board of Directors appointed him Nucor's President and Chief Operating Officer and elected him to the Board.  Ferriola has served as Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor since January 2013. 
"I am honored to be given the opportunity to serve as Chairman of Nucor," Ferriola said.  "I thank the Board for their confidence in me, and I thank our 22,000 teammates for their support that made this honor possible."
"This announcement reflects the thoughtful, planned transition of leadership at Nucor," Milchovich said. "John's appointment as President in 2011 and as CEO in 2013 laid the groundwork for a seamless transition in leadership." 
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Products produced include carbon and alloy steel – in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel piling; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; steel grating and expanded metal; and wire and wire mesh. Nucor, through The David J. Joseph Company, also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HBI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap. Nucor is North America's largest recycler.

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Chairman Emeritus and former President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) Daniel R. DiMicco was inducted into the North Carolina Business Hall of Fame on November 17 by the Junior Achievement of Central Carolinas and the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce. The event honored the accomplishments of outstanding business leaders from across the Tar Heel State.Mr. DiMicco was joined by Mr. Robert J. Barnhill Jr. of the Barnhill Contracting Company and Mrs. Susan Cameron of Reynolds American Inc., each of whom was selected by a panel of business and community leaders for their significant contributions in building and defining the North Carolina business landscape.John J. Ferriola, Nucor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, praised Mr. DiMicco's career as an example for others to follow."Dan's leadership of Nucor was the model which every company should attempt to match," Ferriola said. "The growth that Nucor sustained over the dozen years of his leadership at a time of unprecedented global challenges is remarkable in every sense of the word. Congratulations, Dan, for this most worthy and deserved honor."Mr. DiMicco led Nucor Corporation from September of 2000 through the end of 2012, during which time the company saw unprecedented growth. Mr. DiMicco served as Nucor's Chief Executive Officer longer than anyone since company founder, Ken Iverson. During this time, Nucor completed over 50 acquisitions for a total investment of $6.5 billion. In addition to the company's record of profitable growth, Mr. DiMicco proved himself an effective champion for domestic manufacturing and rules-based, rules-enforced free trade.During Mr. DiMicco's tenure, in 2005, BusinessWeek magazine ranked Nucor the nation's No. 1 Company, based on sales growth and return on investment. In subsequent years, Nucor made three additional appearances on the BusinessWeek 50 list. In 2008, Mr. DiMicco received the Charlotte Business Journal's sixth annual "Business Person of the Year" award. The Harvard Business Review included Dan in its 2010 top 100 list of "The Best Performing CEOs in the World." Additionally, he has been previously inducted into the IndustryWeek Manufacturing Hall of Fame.Ken Iverson, Nucor's transformative President and Chief Executive Officer from the 1960s through the mid-1990s, was himself inducted into the North Carolina Business Hall of Fame in 1997.Nucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada.  Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel – in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel piling; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; steel grating and expanded metal; and wire and wire mesh.  Nucor, through The David J.
