One day motivational leader Greg Wright realized that the four set of pretty young eyes under his own roof were looking to Dad to be strong, fearless, and wise.




Description


One day motivational leader Greg Wright realized that the four set of pretty young eyes under his own roof were looking to Dad to be strong, fearless, and wise.
The reality was, the lone male in an all-girl household ("heck, even the dog was female") was only thirty years old and felt like he had been shoved into the deep end of the estrogen pool without swimming lessons.
That's when the love-struck father of four gorgeous pre-teens started searching for a plan for how to be a successful Dad, and did what any sensible guy would do. He bailed. Not only on his family, but into the woods, to seek a "solution."
Daddy Dates is an entertaining and practical look at how one American father found his sea legs and is navigating through the tricky waters of parenting girls. In this game-changing book, Greg shares his easy-to-follow secrets for how married and single dads can go beyond high-fiving to bridge the gender gap and become the clued-in man who knows his daughter best.
Dads have more influence on their girls than anyone.  Learn what makes your daughter tick, how to talk to her effectively and connect more profoundly, at any age.
If being their hero is your mission, it's not impossible. Daddy Dates is your road map to get there.
"Hi honey. It's Daddy. I'm calling to see if you'd like to go on a date with me tonight."
"Um, yes, Daddy I think I would."
It's a phone call Greg Wright has made over and over again.
By age thirty, Greg was the overwhelmed father of four beautiful little girls, with one thought running through his mind over and over again: Don't Screw Up.
Daddy Dates is about a guy taking his best shot at being a successful dad by trying to know his girls?really know their fears, dreams, and opinions?and how he stumbled across an incredible strategy to do that with daughters of any age or stage. This funny, insightful, and relatable book poses the wildly original concept that should be a "duh" for most dads?but isn't. In order to raise a confident woman-to-be, show your daughter what it feels like to be treated with love, respect, and true interest by a man who loves her.
Daddy Dates is not another "how to" book from a parenting expert. It's a personal, eye-opening, often humorous look at an Average Joe's intentional pursuit of his daughter's hearts and minds, and the love-inspired steps he is taking to solidify Dad's place in each of their lives, forever.
Whether married or single, Daddy Dates can help you better connect with virtually all of the females in your life. Using Greg's communication cues, you'll be blown away by what you'll learn about your child, and how you can make a powerful, lasting difference?especially during her rocky teenage years.
Daddy Dates is about one thing?becoming her hero?one date at a time.
Endorsements:
–Matt Crossman, Senior Writer for SPORTING NEWS magazine (and father of 2 daughters)
DADDY DATES wondrously focuses men (and the women who love them) on the affirmation & empowerment  a father’s creative attention, energy, and love can have on the  precious daughters in our lives. 
–Jan Goldstein, bestselling author of THE BRIDE WILL KEEP HER NAME (and father of 3)
It’s an easy thing to say that any father with a daughter should read this book.  But, the truth

                This review was written for Daddy Dates: Four Daughters, One Clueless Dad, and His Quest to Win Their Hearts.
            
 
            I got this book for my husband who sometimes has trouble talking to our 2 teenage girls. He has tried other books before and set them down because they weren't really what he was looking for. My husband finished this book fairly quickly and I have noticed a distinctive change in his conversations with our girls. I believe this book is a great book for fathers who need a little help with developing a deeper relationship with their daughter(s).

                This review was written for Daddy Dates: Four Daughters, One Clueless Dad, and His Quest to Win Their Hearts.
            
 
            This is one book that I would recommend for all fathers to read. All fathers who want to be dads to their girls. Greg Wright writes about the dates that he has taken his daughters on, and the results of dating his daughters.


I was particularly awed by the ring factor, where upon turning 16, he gives his daughter a ring, promising to take care of her until he hands her over to her husband-to-be. This makes the girl feel very special, and as they continue to date, she matures through the learning process, and gets to know what treatment and attributes to expect from a man - setting her standards pretty high and consequently protecting her from very potential heartbreak.


I highlighted many of the parts as I read, such as the following.


QUOTES


"I believe it's the job of every husband and father to understand that his job - perhaps his most important job is to be the pursuer. Not just at the beginning, but all the way through_.Girls want us to discover their specialness, praise it, and treasure it."


"Keep knocking. Your little girl is in there somewhere, and she wants and needs your love and approval."


"I want their daughters to value their bodies, sure, but also understand that their bodies do not define who they are. That's the plan, anyway. I am trying to teach them that sex - as fun and important as it is in life - will not deliver what they want, which is true love and real intimacy." (Wright)


This is a book I will be reading over and over again. Only one disappointment though, he doesn't talk about how to dad a woman, because as he honestly lets known, he doesn't know how to (yet.) I'm waiting for that book, Wright. Write it, Wright!

                This review was written for Daddy Dates: Four Daughters, One Clueless Dad, and His Quest to Win Their Hearts.
            
 
            Greg Wright is the father of 4 daughters. As they grew older, he felt a burden to capture and hold on to their hearts. In this book, he shares his journey of what he did and what he learned, in the hopes that other dads might benefit from it on their quest to win their daughters' hearts.


I liked the sound of this book. I have read and listened to many messages about making sure you have your children's hearts. So I was curious to read Greg Wright's suggestions.


He is honest and transparent in his story. He doesn't claim to have it all together or to know all the answers. But he does share what he has learned and what works for him. The book is intended for dads, but I enjoyed reading it. As a mom, I still learned a lot from it.


It is so important for children to feel loved and treasured, to know that they matter. They need to know that their parents are willing to take the time to get to know them and that they will make an effort to be available.


This book is a great place to start and includes lots of detailed advice.


Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneezeÃÂ®.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC's 16 CFR, Part 255.

Great book for all men with woman in their lives.

                This review was written for Daddy Dates: Four Daughters, One Clueless Dad, and His Quest to Win Their Hearts.
            
 
            Daddy Dates is a great book for dads looking to love on their daughters. The book is a great starter on how to get involved and actually know who your daughter is. What do they love. What makes them who they are. It gives you some great ideas on how to get to know your daughter and have your whole heart into it. You want your daughters to know that they are valued and loved for who they are.


I think that Greg Wright did a great job on writing this book. He is full of common sense and mixes it up with lots of humor. He is not afraid to say what he thinks and does a great job of saying things that stick with you.


I would really recommend this book to all dads with daughters. I also think it would be a great book for all guys to read so they may be able to understand any woman in their lives better!


*This book was graciously given to me by booksneeze for my review.

                This review was written for Daddy Dates: Four Daughters, One Clueless Dad, and His Quest to Win Their Hearts.
            
 
            I had the pleasure of reading the book daddy dates by Greg Wright. Greg Wright is the father of 4 daughters and realized that he needed to get to know his daughters and came up with the idea to `date' his daughters. He realized he `needed a better strategy to understand what makes them tick so [he] could have a shot at connecting with them in a profound way'.


Although I am not a father as a parent I found this book heartwarming. Watching many children grow up including my own and their friends there are many times where the parent/child relationship is strained and challenged. Taking the time to get to know your child or in this case daughter beyond "how was your day today". The dates do not have to be expensive they just have to be tailored to the child. You must connect with them. Find out what is going on in their life.


I think the relationship between Father/Daughter is so important. It will definitely have an effect on them choosing a spouse. Giving the daughter an understanding on how she deserves to be treated and not just letting anyone into her life.


I was truly blessed reading this book which offers lots of practical advice and the reason why Greg chose to date his daughter. A must to read for every father!

Description by Stephen: "A photo of Gregory which was the first photo used in the New Musical Express."About Stephen WrightWhen Stephen Wright started out as a photographer it was the early 1980s and everything was happening in Manchester; the city he described as one of “rain, sex and rock and roll”. During his time in the city, Wright frequented the fabled Hacienda nightclub and Manchester Apollo before eventually moving back south to start working on shows in London. Over the years he had the opportunity to work on a long list of artists including Nina Simone, James Brown and New Order, but it is arguably his photographs of The Smiths which have the biggest legacy.
In his images, Stephen captures moments in The Smiths’ live shows – the first of which was at the Free Trade Hall. This show, described by Stephen as “truly magnificent’, produced the famous ‘Bum and Flowers’ image amongst others and, a year or so later, he was asked to do the now iconic ‘The Queen is Dead’ shoot.
