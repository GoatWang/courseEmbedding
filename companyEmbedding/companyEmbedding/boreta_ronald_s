Section 7.02           Effect of Termination.    In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers, members or stockholders, other than pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.02 and Section 7.03, which shall survive any such termination.  Nothing contained in this Section 7.02 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

(b)   In the event that this Agreement is terminated by  Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or 7.01(f), the Selling Stockholders, severally or pro rata based on the number of Shares being sold by such Selling Stockholders to Purchaser, shall promptly (and, in any event, within three business days after such termination by Purchaser or, in the case of any termination by the Company, immediately upon such termination) reimburse Purchaser for up to $100,000 of costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the Purchaser Termination Reimbursement ).  The Purchaser Termination Reimbursement shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
(c)   In the event the Selling Stockholders shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.01(c) or 7.01(e), Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within three business days after such termination) reimburse the Selling Stockholders for up to an aggregate amount of $100,000 of costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the Stockholder Termination Reimbursement ).  The Stockholder Termination Reimbursement shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

9

 

 
        resulting from the termination of this Agreement as set forth in Sections 7.03(b) and (c) of this Agreement are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to Sections 7.03(b) and (c) hereof are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred by the parties under such circumstances. The amounts payable pursuant to Sections 7.03(b) and (c) hereof constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy in the event of termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such Sections.

Section 7.04           Specific Performance.            Notwithstanding anything set forth above, the Selling Stockholders acknowledge that Purchaser has entered into the Simultaneous Purchase Agreement in reliance upon Selling Stockholders covenant to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon consummation of the Simultaneous Purchase. The parties hereby agree that, in the event that any Selling Stockholder shall fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than in as a result of Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(c) or 7.01(e)) following consummation of the Simultaneous Purchase, then, in addition to any other remedy set forth above, Purchaser shall be entitled to specific performance, and upon demand by Purchaser, such Selling Stockholder shall be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
ARTICLE VIII
Indemnification; Survival of Representations and Warranties 
 
Section 8.01           Indemnification by the Selling Stockholders.    Each Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, successors in interest, assigns and representatives (collectively, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties )  from and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, fines, costs, proceedings, deficiencies or damages (whether absolute, accrued, conditional or otherwise and whether or not resulting from third party claims), including out-of-pocket expenses, court costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting any of their respective rights hereunder (Losses ) which may be incurred, directly or indirectly, by any such party as a result of, or based upon or arising from (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties made by such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants or agreements made by such Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) any matter as to which such Selling Stockholder in other provisions of this Agreement has expressly agreed to indemnify Purchaser or (iv) any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in enforcing the indemnity provided by this Section 8.01.
 
10

 

 
Section 8.02           Cooperation.    The parties shall cooperate in the defense of all third party claims which may give rise to indemnifiable claims hereunder.  In connection with the defense of any claim, each party shall make available to the party controlling such defense any books, records or other documents within its control and access to employees that are reasonably requested in the course of such defense.
Section 8.03           Limitations on Indemnification.    No Selling Stockholder shall be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Sections 8.01 unless the aggregate of all amounts for which indemnity would otherwise be payable by such Selling Stockholder exceeds $100,000 (except with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.01 and 2.05 with respect to which this threshold shall not apply), and, in such event, the Selling Stockholder shall be responsible for the entire amount.  Each Selling Stockholders indemnity obligations under Section 8.01 with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties in Article II hereof (except with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.01 and 2.05) shall be limited, in the aggregate, to the amount of Purchase Price received by such Selling Stockholder pursuant hereto.
Section 8.04           Notice to Indemnifying Party.    If any party (the Indemnified Party ) receives notice of any claim or other commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which any other party (or parties) (the Indemnifying Party ) is obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 8.01 pursuant to any other specific indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof which notice shall specify, if known, the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom. The failure of a party to give notice under this Section 8.04 shall not relieve any party from liability, unless and to the extent the other party has been materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any claim by a third party for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless a suit shall have been instituted against it and the Indemnifying Party either (i) shall not have undertaken the defense of such suit after notification thereof as provided in Section 8.05 or (ii) is demonstrably unable to undertake the defense of such suit or satisfy the claims arising thereunder.
Section 8.05           Defense by Indemnifying Party.    In connection with any claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any claim or legal proceeding by a person who is not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and expense may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding using counsel of its choice (subject to the approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if it (i) acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such claim and (ii) demonstrates its ability to undertake the defense of such claim or proceeding and satisfy any liabilities resulting therefrom.  The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action, with its counsel and at its own expense; provided , however , that if the Indemnified Party, in its reasonable discretion, determines that there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party (or any constituent party thereof) and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party (or such constituent party thereof) shall
 
11

 

 
have the right to engage separate counsel, the reasonable costs and expenses of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party, but in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable to pay for the costs and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may settle or defend against such claim or litigation, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its counsel and at its own expense.  If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such third-party claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party did not defend or settle such third-party claim in a reasonably prudent manner.
Section 8.06           Survival of Representations and Warranties of the Selling Stockholders.    Notwithstanding any right of Purchaser and the Selling Stockholders to fully investigate the affairs of the other parties hereto and notwithstanding any knowledge of facts determined or determinable by Purchaser or the Selling Stockholders pursuant to such investigation or right of investigation, whether before or after execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, and notwithstanding any waiver of any condition to the Closing, Purchaser and the Selling Stockholders shall have the right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other parties hereto contained in this Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right of indemnification, payment of damages, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.  Except as set forth below, each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement of the Selling Stockholders contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and investigation at any time made by or on behalf of Purchaser and terminate and expire on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, unless on or prior to such date Purchaser has delivered to the Company a written notice of a claim with respect to any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.   Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement, the representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholders contained in Sections 2.01 and 2.05 of this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of Purchaser indefinitely.
Section 8.07           Non-Survival of Representations and Covenants of Purchaser.    Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall terminate upon the Closing.
ARTICLE IX

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
