Early life[edit]
McKillop was born in Dreghorn, a small village in North Ayrshire. He was educated at Irvine Royal Academy and then Glasgow University, where he took a BSc (Hons) and PhD in Chemistry. He joined the ICI Petrochemical & Polymer Laboratory (later renamed the ICI Corporate Laboratory) at Runcorn in 1969 after post-doctoral research work in Paris. He moved to ICI Pharmaceuticals Division in 1975 and, having held a number of positions in Research, in 1989 he was appointed Technical Director of ICI with international responsibilities for research, development and production.
Zeneca[edit]
In 1993, ICI Pharmaceuticals demerged to become Zeneca, and in 1994 he was appointed chief executive officer of the new company. In April 1999, Zeneca merged with Astra to form AstraZeneca PLC. McKillop became chief executive officer (CEO) of the merged company. He retired from AstraZeneca on 1 January 2006, when David Brennan took over as AstraZeneca's CEO. McKillop became the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His brother, Alexander "Sandy" McKillop, was Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of East Anglia from 1970–96.
RBS[edit]




Royal Bank of Scotland's office in Fleet Street, London


McKillop chaired RBS during the tenure of CEO Fred Goodwin, who promoted aggressive expansion of the bank by acquiring other banks. From the time that Goodwin took over as chief executive until 2007, RBS's assets quadrupled, its cost-to-income ratio improved markedly, and its profits soared. In 2006 pre-tax profits climbed 16% to £9.2 billion with most of the growth coming from its investment banking business. By 2008 RBS was the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalisation.[1] One of the factors in its rise was its enthusiasm for supporting leveraged buyouts. In 2008 it lent $9.3bn, more than double its nearest rival.[2]
However, following investor unrest in the build-up to RBS's acquisition of a $1.6bn minority stake in Bank of China in 2005 Goodwin was criticised by some RBS shareholders for putting global expansion ahead of short-term financial returns.[1] Between 2002 and 2005 the share price plateaued at around £17 per share, having nearly trebled between February 2000 and May 2002.[3] Goodwin was accused of megalomania by some shareholders, as reported by Dresdner Kleinwort analyst James Eden (who said he thought the label was 'unwarranted').[4] After the Bank of China deal, he was forced to promise RBS shareholders he would not indulge in any further big acquisitions and focus instead on growing the group organically.[1]
However, in early 2007, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO was under pressure from hedge funds, including Chris Hohn of the hedge fund TCI, to break itself up to maximise shareholder value. ABN chief executive Rijkman Groenink suspected RBS of acting in concert with the hedge fund Tosca, which was chaired by former RBS chairman Mathewson and recommended the takeover bid of an RBS consortium, against the proposed merger with Barclays Bank.[5] Goodwin arranged a consortium of RBS, Fortis and former RBS shareholders Grupo Santander, to purchase the assets of ABN AMRO and break them up in a three-way split. According to the proposed deal, RBS would take over ABN's Chicago operations, LaSalle Bank, and ABN's wholesale operations; while Santander would take the Brazilian operations and Fortis would take the Dutch operations. In a manoeuvre "labelled in all quarters as a poison pill"[5] ABN AMRO agreed to sell key RBS target LaSalle to Bank of America for $21bn, but in July 2007 the consortium offered the same $98bn for ABN's remaining assets, with a higher cash component (93%).[6]
The deal was struck in October 2007 as the global liquidity crisis began to develop, with Barclays withdrawing its EUR61bn bid and ABN's shareholders endorsing the EUR71bn RBS takeover.[5] Coming after the nationalisation of Northern Rock due to the freezing of the wholesale money markets, the deal proved the final straw for RBS, as it severely weakened its balance sheet not only through the size of the acquisition but due to ABN AMRO's substantial exposure to the US subprime mortgage crisis.[1]
While at RBS, the value of the bank's shares fell below a quarter of their level in early 2007. Following criticism from the press for the takeover of ABN AMRO and the UK government having to bail out the bank, McKillop announced his early retirement as Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland on 13 October 2008. At a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, he admitted to having no qualifications in banking. Like the retired bankers present, he apologised for the financial crisis.[7]
Family[edit]
McKillop married Elizabeth Kettle in 1966 and has three children.

For the Scottish footballer, born 1917, see Tom McKillop (footballer).
Sir Thomas Fulton Wilson "Tom" McKillop, FRS (born 19 March 1943) is a Scottish chemist, who was CEO of AstraZeneca PLC from 1999 until 2006 and chairman of the RBS Group from 2006 until 2008.

Early life[edit]
McKillop was born in Dreghorn, a small village in North Ayrshire. He was educated at Irvine Royal Academy and then Glasgow University, where he took a BSc (Hons) and PhD in Chemistry. He joined the ICI Petrochemical & Polymer Laboratory (later renamed the ICI Corporate Laboratory) at Runcorn in 1969 after post-doctoral research work in Paris. He moved to ICI Pharmaceuticals Division in 1975 and, having held a number of positions in Research, in 1989 he was appointed Technical Director of ICI with international responsibilities for research, development and production.
Zeneca[edit]
In 1993, ICI Pharmaceuticals demerged to become Zeneca, and in 1994 he was appointed chief executive officer of the new company. In April 1999, Zeneca merged with Astra to form AstraZeneca PLC. McKillop became chief executive officer (CEO) of the merged company. He retired from AstraZeneca on 1 January 2006, when David Brennan took over as AstraZeneca's CEO. McKillop became the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His brother, Alexander "Sandy" McKillop, was Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of East Anglia from 1970–96.
RBS[edit]




Royal Bank of Scotland's office in Fleet Street, London


McKillop chaired RBS during the tenure of CEO Fred Goodwin, who promoted aggressive expansion of the bank by acquiring other banks. From the time that Goodwin took over as chief executive until 2007, RBS's assets quadrupled, its cost-to-income ratio improved markedly, and its profits soared. In 2006 pre-tax profits climbed 16% to £9.2 billion with most of the growth coming from its investment banking business. By 2008 RBS was the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalisation.[1] One of the factors in its rise was its enthusiasm for supporting leveraged buyouts. In 2008 it lent $9.3bn, more than double its nearest rival.[2]
However, following investor unrest in the build-up to RBS's acquisition of a $1.6bn minority stake in Bank of China in 2005 Goodwin was criticised by some RBS shareholders for putting global expansion ahead of short-term financial returns.[1] Between 2002 and 2005 the share price plateaued at around £17 per share, having nearly trebled between February 2000 and May 2002.[3] Goodwin was accused of megalomania by some shareholders, as reported by Dresdner Kleinwort analyst James Eden (who said he thought the label was 'unwarranted').[4] After the Bank of China deal, he was forced to promise RBS shareholders he would not indulge in any further big acquisitions and focus instead on growing the group organically.[1]
However, in early 2007, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO was under pressure from hedge funds, including Chris Hohn of the hedge fund TCI, to break itself up to maximise shareholder value. ABN chief executive Rijkman Groenink suspected RBS of acting in concert with the hedge fund Tosca, which was chaired by former RBS chairman Mathewson and recommended the takeover bid of an RBS consortium, against the proposed merger with Barclays Bank.[5] Goodwin arranged a consortium of RBS, Fortis and former RBS shareholders Grupo Santander, to purchase the assets of ABN AMRO and break them up in a three-way split. According to the proposed deal, RBS would take over ABN's Chicago operations, LaSalle Bank, and ABN's wholesale operations; while Santander would take the Brazilian operations and Fortis would take the Dutch operations. In a manoeuvre "labelled in all quarters as a poison pill"[5] ABN AMRO agreed to sell key RBS target LaSalle to Bank of America for $21bn, but in July 2007 the consortium offered the same $98bn for ABN's remaining assets, with a higher cash component (93%).[6]
The deal was struck in October 2007 as the global liquidity crisis began to develop, with Barclays withdrawing its EUR61bn bid and ABN's shareholders endorsing the EUR71bn RBS takeover.[5] Coming after the nationalisation of Northern Rock due to the freezing of the wholesale money markets, the deal proved the final straw for RBS, as it severely weakened its balance sheet not only through the size of the acquisition but due to ABN AMRO's substantial exposure to the US subprime mortgage crisis.[1]
While at RBS, the value of the bank's shares fell below a quarter of their level in early 2007. Following criticism from the press for the takeover of ABN AMRO and the UK government having to bail out the bank, McKillop announced his early retirement as Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland on 13 October 2008. At a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, he admitted to having no qualifications in banking. Like the retired bankers present, he apologised for the financial crisis.[7]
Family[edit]
McKillop married Elizabeth Kettle in 1966 and has three children.

Tom McKillop

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For the Scottish footballer, born 1917, see Tom McKillop (footballer).
Sir Thomas Fulton Wilson "Tom" McKillop, FRS (born 19 March 1943) is a Scottish chemist, who was CEO of AstraZeneca PLC from 1999 until 2006 and chairman of the RBS Group from 2006 until 2008.

Early life[edit]
McKillop was born in Dreghorn, a small village in North Ayrshire. He was educated at Irvine Royal Academy and then Glasgow University, where he took a BSc (Hons) and PhD in Chemistry. He joined the ICI Petrochemical & Polymer Laboratory (later renamed the ICI Corporate Laboratory) at Runcorn in 1969 after post-doctoral research work in Paris. He moved to ICI Pharmaceuticals Division in 1975 and, having held a number of positions in Research, in 1989 he was appointed Technical Director of ICI with international responsibilities for research, development and production.
Zeneca[edit]
In 1993, ICI Pharmaceuticals demerged to become Zeneca, and in 1994 he was appointed chief executive officer of the new company. In April 1999, Zeneca merged with Astra to form AstraZeneca PLC. McKillop became chief executive officer (CEO) of the merged company. He retired from AstraZeneca on 1 January 2006, when David Brennan took over as AstraZeneca's CEO. McKillop became the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His brother, Alexander "Sandy" McKillop, was Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of East Anglia from 1970–96.
RBS[edit]




Royal Bank of Scotland's office in Fleet Street, London


McKillop chaired RBS during the tenure of CEO Fred Goodwin, who promoted aggressive expansion of the bank by acquiring other banks. From the time that Goodwin took over as chief executive until 2007, RBS's assets quadrupled, its cost-to-income ratio improved markedly, and its profits soared. In 2006 pre-tax profits climbed 16% to £9.2 billion with most of the growth coming from its investment banking business. By 2008 RBS was the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalisation.[1] One of the factors in its rise was its enthusiasm for supporting leveraged buyouts. In 2008 it lent $9.3bn, more than double its nearest rival.[2]
However, following investor unrest in the build-up to RBS's acquisition of a $1.6bn minority stake in Bank of China in 2005 Goodwin was criticised by some RBS shareholders for putting global expansion ahead of short-term financial returns.[1] Between 2002 and 2005 the share price plateaued at around £17 per share, having nearly trebled between February 2000 and May 2002.[3] Goodwin was accused of megalomania by some shareholders, as reported by Dresdner Kleinwort analyst James Eden (who said he thought the label was 'unwarranted').[4] After the Bank of China deal, he was forced to promise RBS shareholders he would not indulge in any further big acquisitions and focus instead on growing the group organically.[1]
However, in early 2007, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO was under pressure from hedge funds, including Chris Hohn of the hedge fund TCI, to break itself up to maximise shareholder value. ABN chief executive Rijkman Groenink suspected RBS of acting in concert with the hedge fund Tosca, which was chaired by former RBS chairman Mathewson and recommended the takeover bid of an RBS consortium, against the proposed merger with Barclays Bank.[5] Goodwin arranged a consortium of RBS, Fortis and former RBS shareholders Grupo Santander, to purchase the assets of ABN AMRO and break them up in a three-way split. According to the proposed deal, RBS would take over ABN's Chicago operations, LaSalle Bank, and ABN's wholesale operations; while Santander would take the Brazilian operations and Fortis would take the Dutch operations. In a manoeuvre "labelled in all quarters as a poison pill"[5] ABN AMRO agreed to sell key RBS target LaSalle to Bank of America for $21bn, but in July 2007 the consortium offered the same $98bn for ABN's remaining assets, with a higher cash component (93%).[6]
The deal was struck in October 2007 as the global liquidity crisis began to develop, with Barclays withdrawing its EUR61bn bid and ABN's shareholders endorsing the EUR71bn RBS takeover.[5] Coming after the nationalisation of Northern Rock due to the freezing of the wholesale money markets, the deal proved the final straw for RBS, as it severely weakened its balance sheet not only through the size of the acquisition but due to ABN AMRO's substantial exposure to the US subprime mortgage crisis.[1]
While at RBS, the value of the bank's shares fell below a quarter of their level in early 2007. Following criticism from the press for the takeover of ABN AMRO and the UK government having to bail out the bank, McKillop announced his early retirement as Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland on 13 October 2008. At a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, he admitted to having no qualifications in banking. Like the retired bankers present, he apologised for the financial crisis.[7]
Family[edit]
McKillop married Elizabeth Kettle in 1966 and has three children.

Dr. McKillop served as the Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group from April 2006 through February 2009, the President of the Science Council in the United Kingdom from February 2007 through September 2011, and a non-executive director of BP plc, from 2004 to 2009, Lloyds TSB Group plc, from 1999 to 2004, Nycomed Amersham plc and its predecessor companies, from 1992 to 2001, and UCB SA, a Euronext-listed biopharmaceuticals manufacturer, from November 2009 until May 2016. He is currently a non-executive director of Almirall, S.A., a pharmaceuticals company listed on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges, for which he is also President of its appointments and remuneration committee.

      ■ Sir Thomas (Tom) McKillop presided over the 1999 merger of Zeneca
      Group—formerly ICI Pharmaceuticals—with Astra of Sweden,
      forming the new London-based company AstraZeneca, at the time the
      fifth-largest drug manufacturer in the world. McKillop began his career as
      a research scientist but eventually rose through the ranks to management
      positions. Although the names changed and the businesses he worked for
      went through considerable development, McKillop was one of those rare
      individuals in the modern corporate world who stayed with the same company
      for more than 30 years.
    

      EARLY CAREER
    

      McKillop, a miner's son from Ayrshire, Scotland, never imagined for
      himself a career in business; his early ambitions

      were in the field of chemistry. He obtained both a bachelor's
      degree with honors and then a doctorate through his study of carbonium ion
      rearrangements at Glasgow University. He then went on to do postdoctoral
      research in Paris.
    

      In 1969 McKillop joined ICI Corporation as a research scientist and began
      slowly rising through the ranks. He was initially employed in ICI's
      corporate research laboratory but in 1975 moved over to the
      Pharmaceuticals division. He held a number of research positions in that
      division, including director of research at the company's
      France-based facility from 1978 to 1980 and chemical manager from 1980 to
      1984. Further promotions saw McKillop gradually leave his scientific
      research roots behind and enter the world of buiness management; he became
      ICI Pharmaceuticals' general manager of research in 1984, then
      general manager of development in 1985, then technical director in 1989.
      In the last position McKillop
       was in charge of international research, development, and production.
    

      ICI BECOMES ZENECA
    

      Imperial Chemical Industries (later ICI) had begun business in the United
      Kingdom in 1926. Before World War II the company that had been primarily
      an explosives and dyestuffs manufacturer became involved in drug making at
      the behest of the British government, developing an antimalarial drug for
      British troops. After the war ICI's senior management concluded
      that pharmaceuticals would be important in the future and put together a
      team of scientists that became ICI Pharmaceuticals as of 1957. At first
      the division incurred consistent losses, but the company's
      long-term investment paid dividends 20 years later when ICI scientists
      discovered beta-blockers, the first drugs to be found effective in the
      treatment of hypertension.
    

      Zeneca Group was created by a demerger from ICI in January 1993, wherein
      chemical activities were effectively separated from the biosciences side
      of the business. Zeneca was built on three former business units of ICI:
      the pharmaceutical, agricultural-chemical, and specialty-chemical units.
      McKillop was appointed chief executive officer of Zeneca Phamaceuticals in
      1994, and two years later became executive director of Zeneca Group.
    

      ZENECA MERGES WITH ASTRA
    

      In December 1998 the announcement was made that Zeneca would merge with
      Astra, the Swedish pharmaceutical company. Astra was founded in 1913 and
      was active in pharmaceutical research, development, manufacture, and
      marketing in four main areas: gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
      respiratory, and pain control. At the time of the merger Astra's
      key products included Losec (omeprazole), a gastrointestinal drug that was
      the world's best-selling pharmaceutical; Xylocaine, the
      world's best-selling local anesthetic; and a number of respiratory
      drugs. At that time Zeneca's key products included Dirpivan
      (propofol), the world's best-selling injectable general anesthetic,
      and a range of oncology drugs such as Zoladex (goserelin acetate), Casodex
      (bicalutamide), Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate), and Arimidex (anastrozole).
      Zeneca was also the producer of a number of agrochemicals, such as
      Gramoxone, Fusilade, Touchdown, and Surpass, all herbicides; Karate, an
      insecticide; and Amistar, a fungicide. Astra and Zeneca were two companies
      with similar product areas as well as similar science-based cultures.
    

      McKillop was chosen to be the CEO of the newly formed company, which would
      be called AstraZeneca. In many ways McKillop was an unexpected choice, as
      he had never run such a large corporation and bore a background in
      research rather than in business. However, he did have a 30-year history
      with Zeneca and had witnessed and taken lessons from all of the changes
      the company underwent through that period of time. McKillop's
      reputation for working long hours—which was made possible by his
      ability to function normally on only fours hours of sleep a
      night—enabled him to oversee the completion of the merger that
      created AstraZeneca in only 80 days. In February 1999 the Zeneca
      shareholders approved the merger, which was then approved by both the
      European Commission and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. AstraZeneca
      officially came into being on April 6, 1999.
    

      Business analysts would point to the merger as a prime example of how
      successful such unions could be. The new company soon realized operational
      and research savings and also found itself with a greater ability to spur
      long-term growth and offer more strategic financial options. In a speech
      to shareholders McKillop referred to the unification as a "merger
      of equals" (May 19, 1999); he credited its success to the broad
      acceptance employees and shareholders had for the new company. Considered
      by others to be a plain-spoken, no-nonsense manager, McKillop's
      honest and forthright approach to the merger sidestepped the uncertainty
      often experienced in such deals. At the time the merger was the largest
      ever in Europe and created the world's fifth-largest
      pharmaceuticals company. McKillop remarked during the new company's
      first shareholders meeting, "From being two medium-sized companies,
      we are now one at the very top" (May 19, 1999).
    

      Far from resting on his laurels, McKillop continued to innovate and
      expand, beginning with a spin-off merging of AstraZeneca's
      agricultural-chemical business with Novartis's crop-protection and
      seed business. The move was unexpected, as the two companies were seen as
      rivals, but both benefited. The deal was completed in 2000, creating
      Syngenta, the world's largest agrochemical company, with a market
      share at inception of almost 23 percent.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      McKillop was said to maintain a hands-on approach at AstroZeneca, which he
      was particularly capable of doing thanks to his years working throughout
      the many levels of the company, giving him broad insight into all aspects
      of operations. In 2001 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       named McKillop one of its top "25 Managers to Watch."
    

      The pharmaceutical industry was always shaped by the successes or failures
      of long-term research projects; yet while a long-term approach was vital,
      McKillop recognized that with the expiration of patents and the widespread
      manufacture of generic equivalent drugs the industry was always in flux.
      He told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , "You have to reinvent the business every decade" (January
      8, 2001).
    

      McKillop and AstraZeneca took matters of corporate social responsibility
      very seriously. McKillop told Euractiv.com, a
       European Union News and Policy organization, "We believe wherever
      we operate we should be a contributory part of that community"
      (March 17, 2004). AstraZeneca's commitment to tuberculosis
      research—for which a research laboratory was opened in Bangalore,
      India—was an example of how the company viewed its wider role in
      the world. McKillop suggested that such philanthropy should be seen as a
      good business practice for a drug-making company, as a positive public
      image could make a firm the preferred choice of conscientious customers.
      In a competitive marketplace and in an industry often beset with
      public-relations problems, his approach won widespread praise.
    

      PUBLIC LIFE
    

      McKillop strongly supported higher education and research in his roles as
      prochancellor of the University of Leicester, a member of the Society for
      Drug Research, and a trustee of the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. He also
      served as chairman of the British Pharma Group and of the NorthWest
      Science Council. In June 2002 he was appointed president of the European
      Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) at its
      General Assembly in Bruges for a two-year term, having previously served
      as the federation's vice president. He served as a nonexecutive
      director with Lloyds TSB Group, Amersham International, and several other
      companies.
    

      McKillop listed his interests as sports, reading, music,
      and—emblematic of his hands-on approach to both life and
      business—carpentry. He received knighthood in the 2002
      Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to the pharmaceuticals
      industry. In recognition of his work and commitments to education and the
      wider community, he was the recipient of a number of honorary degrees,
      from Manchester in 1999 and from Glasgow, Leicester, and Huddersfield in
      2000.

      first shareholders meeting, "From being two medium-sized companies,
      we are now one at the very top" (May 19, 1999).
    

      Far from resting on his laurels, McKillop continued to innovate and
      expand, beginning with a spin-off merging of AstraZeneca's
      agricultural-chemical business with Novartis's crop-protection and
      seed business. The move was unexpected, as the two companies were seen as
      rivals, but both benefited. The deal was completed in 2000, creating
      Syngenta, the world's largest agrochemical company, with a market
      share at inception of almost 23 percent.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      McKillop was said to maintain a hands-on approach at AstroZeneca, which he
      was particularly capable of doing thanks to his years working throughout
      the many levels of the company, giving him broad insight into all aspects
      of operations. In 2001 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       named McKillop one of its top "25 Managers to Watch."
    

      The pharmaceutical industry was always shaped by the successes or failures
      of long-term research projects; yet while a long-term approach was vital,
      McKillop recognized that with the expiration of patents and the widespread
      manufacture of generic equivalent drugs the industry was always in flux.
      He told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , "You have to reinvent the business every decade" (January
      8, 2001).
    

      McKillop and AstraZeneca took matters of corporate social responsibility
      very seriously. McKillop told Euractiv.com, a
       European Union News and Policy organization, "We believe wherever
      we operate we should be a contributory part of that community"
      (March 17, 2004). AstraZeneca's commitment to tuberculosis
      research—for which a research laboratory was opened in Bangalore,
      India—was an example of how the company viewed its wider role in
      the world. McKillop suggested that such philanthropy should be seen as a
      good business practice for a drug-making company, as a positive public
      image could make a firm the preferred choice of conscientious customers.
      In a competitive marketplace and in an industry often beset with
      public-relations problems, his approach won widespread praise.
    

      PUBLIC LIFE
    

      McKillop strongly supported higher education and research in his roles as
      prochancellor of the University of Leicester, a member of the Society for
      Drug Research, and a trustee of the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. He also
      served as chairman of the British Pharma Group and of the NorthWest
      Science Council. In June 2002 he was appointed president of the European
      Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) at its
      General Assembly in Bruges for a two-year term, having previously served
      as the federation's vice president. He served as a nonexecutive
      director with Lloyds TSB Group, Amersham International, and several other
      companies.
    

      McKillop listed his interests as sports, reading, music,
      and—emblematic of his hands-on approach to both life and
      business—carpentry. He received knighthood in the 2002
      Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to the pharmaceuticals
      industry. In recognition of his work and commitments to education and the
      wider community, he was the recipient of a number of honorary degrees,
      from Manchester in 1999 and from Glasgow, Leicester, and Huddersfield in
      2000.

Wednesday 1 April 2009 11.00 EDT


First published on Wednesday 1 April 2009 11.00 EDT






The former Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Tom McKillop resigned from the board of BP today to avoid the humiliation of a protest vote against his re-election at this month's annual meeting.McKillop will leave at the 16 April annual meeting. He took the decision to resign the day after his public row with City minister Lord Myners over a £703,000-a-year pension for Sir Fred Goodwin escalated.As McKillop announced he was resigning, Myners was being forced to answer a private notice question tabled by the Tories to insist there was "no discrepancy on matters of substance" between the two men's accounts of what and when he knew about Goodwin's pension.The decision by McKillop and other members of the RBS board to sanction the payment to the former RBS chief executive will result in the RBS remuneration report being voted down at its annual meeting on Friday by the government body that holds a controlling stake in the bank. McKillop is bearing the brunt of investor anger about the Goodwin pension and the near collapse of RBS. Leading institutional investors had been considering whether to register their feelings by abstaining or voting against his re-election to the BP board. BP insiders insisted there was no question of McKillop facing pressure to go from the company. But one source conceded that McKillop had in effect accused Myners. "That must put him in the firing line of the government now."RBS has traditionally enjoyed close contacts with the oil industry.BP chief executive Tony Hayward indicated that the board had not pushed McKillop. He said: "Tom has provided wise counsel to me and the entire board. I am sorry he did not feel he could continue to serve with us. We will miss him."McKillop said he felt it was "an appropriate step for me to take at this time".BP is chaired by Peter Sutherland, who was a dominant figure on RBS's board until last month's boardroom clear out. Sutherland is planning to leave BP before next year's annual meeting.Myners said yesterday the "critical factor" in the row was whether the RBS board had discretion about Goodwin's pension. In a letter to the Treasury select committee chairman, John McFall, he stressed the new RBS board was "conducting a serious and urgent legal investigation" into the validity of Goodwin's pension entitlement.
