Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock International Growth and Income Trust’s (BGY) (the “Trust”) primary investment objective is to provide current income and current gains, with a secondary objective of long-term capital appreciation. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in dividend-paying equity securities issued by non-U.S. companies and utilizing an option writing (selling) strategy to seek total return performance and enhance distributions. The Trust invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets in dividend-paying equity securities issued by non-U.S. companies. The Trust may invest in securities of companies of any market capitalization, but intends to invest primarily in securities of large capitalization companies. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.

Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).
