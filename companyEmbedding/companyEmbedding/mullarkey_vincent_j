Digital Equipment Loses Another of Its Top Officials


By GLENN RIFKIN


Published: May 27, 1994









                    In the midst of a painful struggle to return to profitability, the Digital Equipment Corporation lost yet another executive when the chief financial officer, William M. Steul, resigned yesterday.        

                    The company announced that its controller, Vincent J. Mullarkey, 46, who has been at Digital for 23 years, would become a vice president and the chief financial officer.        

                    Mr. Steul was named chief financial officer by the founder of Digital, Kenneth H. Olsen, in June 1992, weeks before the board asked Mr. Olsen to resign as president. Mr. Steul's rise had been controversial because he had not worked in the finance operation for more than a decade.        

                    When Robert B. Palmer succeeded Mr. Olsen, he retained Mr. Steul. But several executives have left the company, including Edward Lucente, vice president of worldwide sales and marketing, Edward McDonough, vice president of manufacturing, and Winston Hindle, vice president of quality, ethics and business practices. A spokeswoman for Digital said the departures of Mr. McDonough and Mr. Hindle were planned retirements.        

                    Last month the company reported a $183 million loss for its third fiscal quarter, and Mr. Palmer conceded that he had been caught by surprise by the severity of the loss. Analysts speculated that Mr. Steul might have been a victim of that debacle as Mr. Palmer sought stronger finanical leadership for the company.        

                    Franc Romano, a former Digital finance manager and market research director and now a consultant with the Aberdeen Group in Boston, said Mr. Steul had stepped into a job "that nobody in the company wanted and, to some extent, has taken the rap for the company's poor performance."        

                    Mr. Romano said he was disappointed that Mr. Palmer had not used this opportunity to look outside Digital and bring in "much needed financial leadership and talent."        

                    "Vin's only job has been at Digital," Mr. Romano added, "and I don't think he brings the broad business experience that Palmer says he does to Digital." Controller for 18 Months        

                    Mr. Palmer said in a statement that Digital was making steady progress back to profitability and that the appointment of Mr. Mullarkey, with his background in financial management and controls, "is consistent with our determination to concentrate on accelerating that progress."        

                    Mr. Mullarkey has held financial-management positions in Digital operations and business units in Europe, Asia and the United States, and he has been corporate controller, reporting to Mr. Steul, for 18 months.        

                    In an interview, Mr. Mullarkey said he was surprised by Mr. Steul's decision to step down, but would not comment on why that decision was made. He did say Mr. Steul had recommended him as his successor. Mr. Steul was not available for comment.        

                    Mr. Mullarkey said Digital's finance organization was strong. "I don't expect we'll miss a beat," he said. "I plan to crank up the rpm's and move forward aggressively."        

                    He said he was focusing on restoring competitiveness and emphasizing a return to sustainable profitability. He said reducing costs and improving asset management and cash positions would be crucial as Digital moved to its next phase of renovation.  Mr. Palmer told employees last month that the company would cut an additional 20,000 workers beginning in the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1.        

                    Digital has also said it will incur another significant restructuring charge, possibly as high as $1 billion, according to analysts. Mr. Mullarkey said details might be announced at the end of next month.        

                    "I'm focusing on optimizing the company while it's in transition," Mr. Mullarkey said. "This can be very complicated, particuarly with the further level of downsizing we have to deal with. We don't want to lose control during this time." Weekly Closing of Books        

                    Mr. Mullarkey added that he was putting into place controls to help increase the predictability of quarterly results, a problem for Digital in recent quarters. Mr. Mullarkey said Digital was closing its books weekly rather than monthly, to avoid missing important changes like aggressive discounting late in a quarter. "I know of no other companies' doing it like this," he said.        

                    Mr. Mullarkey also responded to reports published yesterday about a memo from the Digital treasurer, Ilene Jacobs, that warned executives that the cash level for the company was in jeopardy. "Cash on hand is largely on target with our expectations," he said. Ms. Jacobs's memo had "a couple of very bold statements" that the reports had taken out of context, he said.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
