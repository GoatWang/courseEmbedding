Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

New $100 million Wheatfield Village development planned for 29th and Fairlawn to include movie theater, new restaurants













An artist’s rendering of the Wheatfield Village project at 29th Street and Fairlawn Road. Owned by businessmen Jim Klausman and Butch Eaton, the 14.7-acre site will be a mixed-use development. All designs are by Schwerdt Design Group Inc. (Submitted)  









John Petersen, a real estate attorney for Polsinelli Law Firm, discusses the $93 million Wheatfield Village development that could potentially be built at 29th and Fairlawn during an interview with investors Tuesday afternoon. The development would feature a hotel, movie theater, coffee shop, restaurants and a modern apartment complex if the investors can secure a public-private partnership with the city. (Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal)  









Jim Klausman, co-owner of the property at 29th and Fairlawn, talks about his vision for the Wheatfield Village development during an interview with investors in the project Tuesday afternoon.

The $100 million Wheatfield Village development at S.W. 29th and Fairlawn will bring new businesses to Topeka, including a Marriott hotel, a nine-screen theater, a Johnny’s Tavern and a SPIN! Pizza.



 


Businessmen Jim Klausman and Butch Eaton purchased the 14.7-acre property in 2015 with the idea of creating a mixed-use development, the first of its kind in Topeka.
“We really wanted to create a lifestyle environment where we focused on living, working and playing all in the same environment,” said Greg Schwerdt, president of Schwerdt Design Group Inc., which designed the project. “Jim and Butch early on did not want to develop anything that was just going to be a retail strip center.”
Professionals with Wheatfield Development went in front of the Topeka City Council Tuesday evening, presenting a plan overview as they prepare to seek incentives for the project.
“Development has moved in Kansas from a lot of greenfield developments to redevelopment, repositioning,” said John Petersen, a real estate attorney at Polsinelli, Overland Park. “Extraordinary sites with extraordinary design and extraordinary ideas unfortunately come with extraordinary costs that don’t necessarily pencil in to your typical equity-debt type of financing structure.”
Clearing off a site and bringing it up to top standards, including moving utilities and other such work, can be more expensive than building on the greenfield, or new, undeveloped, sites, he said.
Both the tenants and 29 Fairlawn LLC are in business and need to get a return on their investment, Petersen said, and in-fill developments like Wheatfield usually require help from city incentives. Public hearings will be set on proposals the Wheatfield developers have that would create a public-private partnership to make sure it happens.
As Petersen tackles the complex issue of financing the project, Schwerdt and tenants who have committed to the development are focused on creating a new community that puts Topeka ahead of anywhere else in Kansas.
“I think the neat thing here is that Jim and his group are way ahead of the curve in where the vision is going on a lot of these developments,” said Matt Pennington, president of Drake Development, Overland Park. “They don’t exist yet. To see Topeka get one of these first, really ahead of Kansas City is a testament to Jim and the rest of these people who are here.”
As Pennington sought tenants for the development, Schwerdt focused on creating a design that would match what Klausman and Eaton wanted to do.
Green spaces, or open park-like spaces, are abundant at Wheatfield, meant to support a quality of life that is becoming popular nationwide and trending words like “walkability.” Using stone and wood to create a warm atmosphere, Schwerdt said the focus was on creating a community with a resort style.
A 600-square-foot pavilion area will offer a place for a Southwest Topeka Farmer’s Market, and can be used for other outdoor activities or events, he said. In addition, the design connects the Shunga Trail to Wheatfield.
“We worked with the city to move the Shunga Trail from the north side of the creek to the south side,” Schwerdt said, adding that they saved the city about $500,000 because they didn’t have to build a bridge.
Anyone biking or walking the trail will be able to swing into Wheatfield, grab a cup of coffee at PT’s Coffee, lunch at Johnny’s Tavern or SPIN! Pizza and then head back to the trail, he said.
Apartment Living
The living component of the mixed-used development is a 178-unit apartment complex Klausman and Eaton will develop with EPC Real Estate Group, Kansas City, Mo., an award-winning multi-family developer. They’re targeted to people seeking high-quality living with quality amenities.
The apartment complex, which is still in design stages, will be the second phase of the project, developed just shortly behind the other elements, Klausman said. But he was excited about one design element, that he referred to as wrap parking.
The parking will be in the center of the apartments, which will “wrap” the structure.
“Individuals can have indoor parking and they can walk directly out of their space right into the complex,” Klausman said, adding that the design is efficient, makes parking accessible and provides high security.
“We also provide some amenities such as private courtyards and pools that typically you wouldn’t find in this type of environment,” Schwerdt said.
Topeka hasn’t seen the building of a high-quality apartment complex in at least 20 years, he said.
“There is a big demand for the quality type of facility that we’re looking at. I think there’s a shortage in general, and even more of a shortage of high-end quality,” Schwerdt said.
A movie night out
B&B Theatre is a 93-year-old Liberty, Mo., company that is specializing in high-end movie theaters, with reclining seats, full kitchens and a bar, said Brock Bagby, a fourth-generation family member who is vice president of programming and business development.
Bagby said a 9-screen theater with a full kitchen, bar and reclining seats is planned for the Wheatfield site.
B&B has 50 locations in seven states, with about 400 screens, he said. They’ve been focused on remodeling many of their properties to include the amenities and finding success.
“Thirty-three percent of our screens are now recliner seating, a full La-Z-Boy, and we’ve got almost 20 bars now and six kitchens,” he said.
The ease of watching movies from home hasn’t hurt them at all, Bagby said.
“People that had stopped going to movies are coming back,” he said. “My grandpa always said that everybody has a kitchen, but they go out to dinner. You’ve got to get out of the house. Regardless of Netflix, home screening, giant screens at home, people still want to get out of the house, and now we’re elevating the experience with recliners and food and a bar and massive wall-to-wall curved screens.”
Grab coffee and a bite to eat
Wheatfield will be home to PT’s Coffee, a new SPIN! Pizza and a Johnny’s Tavern.
Brent Boles, SPIN! developer who recently opened a location in Lawrence, has been seeking the perfect spot in Topeka for months. He intended to open Topeka before Lawrence, but wanted to be in Wheatfield.
“We’re kind of a unique style, it’s called polished fast casual,” he said of the restaurant. “What that means is people come through, decide what they want, place their order and then they get full-service at their table.”
The hand-spun, homestyled pizza uses fresh ingredients, and everything is made from scratch, Boles said.
Being involved in the mixed-use development is exciting, he added.
“People will be attracted to that, the fact that we can park our car and walk to a movie theater and walk to a couple of different restaurants. We don’t have that right now.”
Fred Polzin, CFO of PT’s, agreed that the concept makes a difference to his company.
“These type of developments are really, really becoming more popular,” he said. “This will actually be our fourth location that’s involved directly with an apartment-type complex. We’ve got a few more potentially in the works. We’ve found a lot of times that coffee shops and apartments go hand in hand because they create a nice customer base that’s there every day and that’s when a coffee shop really becomes a community for that area.”
The store will be the company’s first drive-thru location, Polzin said.
Johnny’s Tavern is a well-known Lawrence bar and restaurant, with nine locations in Lawrence and the Kansas City area.
Spend the night or a few weeks
Liberty, Mo.-based Ferguson Properties will develop a TowneSuites Place by Marriott hotel at Wheatfield, an extended stay, upscale concept by the international Marriott brand.
“It has nice amenities like full kitchens in each room, a nice pool, outdoor grilling areas,” said Jeff Sharp, Ferguson vice president. His company currently is developing two TownSuites Marriott hotels in Hays and Leavenworth. The company has been a long-time Marriott franchisee.
“This is a really nice product that we’re going to build, and we helped Jim (Klausman) analyze this market on what would be built here and what would do well,” Sharp said.
He reiterated what Petersen said about incentives, adding that they will be crucial to the continuation of the development.
Development of the hotel will require investment of $12 to $13 million, Sharp said.
Being a part of Wheatfield offers the company the “full package” of amenities and this will be the first time Ferguson Development has been involved with a mixed-use development like this one.
Moving forward
Bob Johnson, a Polsinelli attorney, presented the development to the city council. Depending on how quickly public hearings are set and things move forward, Klausman and Schwerdt are hopeful to begin clearing the site by fall.
“What we really have here is a local, home-grown developer that’s taking a big risk,” Johnson said. “He’s taking a risk on a new concept in this community. It will take a public-private partnership to bring the level that Jim wants to bring to Topeka, and what these tenants expect and deserve.”
For Klausman, Wheatfield is an investment, but it’s also a little bit of touching his roots. When he and Eaton founded Midwest Health Services, an early office 35 years ago, as they built their business, was in a little strip mall on the S.W. 29th and Fairlawn property they purchased.
He laughed. “It was not the best office space in town.”
All it takes is $100 million, incentives, planning, tenant commitments and tenacity to create a different vision on that corner.

The $100 million Wheatfield Village development at S.W. 29th and Fairlawn will bring new businesses to Topeka, including a Marriott hotel, a nine-screen theater, a Johnny’s Tavern and a SPIN! Pizza.



 


Businessmen Jim Klausman and Butch Eaton purchased the 14.7-acre property in 2015 with the idea of creating a mixed-use development, the first of its kind in Topeka.
“We really wanted to create a lifestyle environment where we focused on living, working and playing all in the same environment,” said Greg Schwerdt, president of Schwerdt Design Group Inc., which designed the project. “Jim and Butch early on did not want to develop anything that was just going to be a retail strip center.”

The bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Ifie Sekibo, who was represented by Monye, said the need for the partnership became imperative in view of the importance of agriculture to Nigeria’s sustainable development.
Heritage Bank Plc, in Lagos, at the weekend, signed a N232 million pilot phase of out-growers agreement with Biase Plantations Limited (BPL), and its joint venture partner, PZ Wilmar Limited.
The move is expected to support plans to restore Nigeria’s lost glory in the agricultural sector and reposition the country as the highest oil palm producer in the world.
The pact, sealed at the bank’s headquarters in Lagos, at the weekend, saw the Executive Director, Business Banking, Jude Monye, and Executive Director, Retail and SME Bank, Mrs. Adaeze Udensi, sign on behalf of the bank, while the General Manager of BPL, Ahmad Mustaffa Goh, signed on behalf of his company.






The bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Ifie Sekibo, who was represented by Monye, said the need for the partnership became imperative in view of the importance of agriculture to Nigeria’s sustainable development.
Sekibo said the initiative will support government’s efforts towards diversifying the aggregate economy, and assured Biase Plantations that Heritage Bank would not relent in giving it the necessary financial and investment advisory support required for the success of the agricultural scheme in different parts of Nigeria.
On behalf of his company, Goh said: “Today marks a milestone in the actualisation of a long dream by Biase Plantations Limited. It has always been our priority to improve the socio-economic status of our landlord communities by developing an out-growers scheme that will build the resilience of local farmers to changing agricultural trend.”
He added that the agreement between BPL and Heritage Bank is a first of its kind in Nigeria, and a readiness of the bank to partner and grow with the vision of the Company.
According to him, the out growers’ scheme is targeted at developing a sustainable small holder’s scheme, which will eventually increase the product supply.
The Group Head, Agriculture Finance and Export of the bank, Olugbenga Awe, explained that the pilot scheme covers 45 farmers, grouped into four co-operative societies with a land mass of 150 hectares, and the funds to be administered is from BPL.
He said Heritage Bank will leverage its expertise in agribusiness to organise the out growers, and administer the fund bearing in mind the peculiarity of oil palm as a cash crop with long gestation period.
He also said the programme will ensure financial inclusion, and empower the farmers, create market access for them and increase their yield through trainings on sustainability and good agricultural practices.
PZ Wilmar Limited is a joint venture between PZ Cussons International, UK, and Wilmar International Limited Singapore.
In Nigeria, Wilmar is involved in oil palm cultivation with a total land hectare of 26,500 located in Akamkpa, Biase, Odukpani, and Akpabuyo local government areas of Cross River State.
Other Wilmar’s business activities globally include oilseed crushing, edible oil refining, sugar milling and refining, specialty fat, oleo chemical, biodiesel and fertiliser manufacturing and grain processing.

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.
