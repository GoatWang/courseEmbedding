(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Vodka Brands Corp ("Vodka Brands", the "Company", "we", and "our") for three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Our Business  We began operations on April 17, 2014 (Inception) and operate within the alcoholic spirit industry. Through our operations we oversee the manufacturing of our Blue Diamond Vodka and sell our product in the United States with hopes of expanding internationally. We have a federal permit to import alcoholic beverages. Currently, our customers include the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board the Alcoholic Beverage Control of Mississippi. We are also licensed in West Virginia and Tennessee and we have signed an agreement with a distributor in Tennessee. We anticipate a purchase order for the State of Tennessee within the next several weeks. We plan to continue to develop our trademarked name "Blue Diamond" brand as well as our other trademarked brands.  Our cash on hand as of March 31, 2016, was $24,584.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Sales  We generated sales of $10,481 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and $11,925 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease is due primarily to the lower order volumes. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we sold 828 bottles versus 900 bottles sold during the three months ended March 31, 2015  The most significant variable in product cost in the future is expected to be currency exchange rates between the Euro and the US Dollar. Our European suppliers invoice in Euros. We do not believe that inflation had any material impact on us during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.  We recognize revenue when four basic criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) shipment has occurred; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured.  With the introduction of Blue Diamond Vodka as a shelf item in the State of Pennsylvania two years ago, our sales are currently to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and can be found in roughly forty-five of their stores. If we were to lose this customer, our operations would be materially impacted. However, we have the possibility to increase the number of stores in Pennsylvania, and much greater potential nationally, and internationally. To this end, we continued to generate sales to the Mississippi Department of Revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our product is sold in approximately forty stores in Mississippi.  In January 2016, we began issuing customer incentives on our Blue Diamond Vodka through the use of mail-in rebate coupons. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were reduced by estimated rebate costs of $415.  Cost of Goods Sold  Our cost of sales was $8,399 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to $7,529 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase in our cost of sales was primarily due to higher inventory storage costs.  Gross profit  We expect to be able to maintain a gross profit margin over 25% on our product.  Selling, general administrative and other expenses (SG&A)  Our most significant selling costs are promotional and advertising expenses as we continue to develop brand recognition. The most significant general and administrative costs were legal and accounting expenses.  The market for spirits and vodka is large. We have the potential to expand sales dramatically. This will be determined in large part by our success in attracting distributors. Although, we believe the market is large, we are uncertain if our product will obtain significant demand. Additionally, we are uncertain with regards to industry trends or events that will materially impact our operational condition whether beneficial or detrimental.  Net loss  We incurred a net loss of $69,335 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and $18,341 for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or possibly debt financing.  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  Deferred Tax Asset and Valuation Allowance  We recorded a deferred tax asset, but recorded a full valuation allowance against this asset as it is uncertain if we will be able to realize any of this benefit.  Related Parties  During the period April 17, 2014 (Inception) through December 31, 2014, we purchased all of our inventory from Beverage Brands, Inc. ("BBI"), a wholly owned company of our CEO. The purchase price was recorded at the price BBI paid for the product from a third party manufacturer. Additionally, BBI acted as a conduit with a third party to facilitate sales to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board as we did not have our federal import license. We obtained our federal import license in April of 2015. There were no fees or expenses paid to or retained by BBI with regards to this arrangement.  During April 2014, Trademark Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned company of our CEO, contributed the trademarks Blue Diamond, Diamond Girl, Blue Crystal and White Crystal. We recorded the trademarks at carryover basis and will continue to amortize these trademarks in accordance with their useful life from the date of registration.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  As of March 31, 2016, our current assets were $106,152 and our current liabilities were $58,732 and as of December 31, 2015 our current assets were $142,964 and our current liabilities were $40,084.  As of March 31, 2016, our stockholders' equity was $48,304 and as of December 31, 2015 our stockholders' equity was $103,839.  At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had 11,842,333 and 11,796,333 common shares outstanding, respectively.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $20,061 and for the three months ended March 31, 2015 net cash used in operating activities was $90,074. The change was primarily a result in the purchase of our second production of Blue Diamond Vodka in February 2015.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  We have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of shares of our common stock. For the tree months ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activity was $9,200 and for the three months ended March 31, 2015 net cash provided by financing activities was $17,000 received from proceeds from issuance of our common stock to investors.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  Operations  Our overriding objective is to produce high quality vodka products with recognizable brand names and to expand distribution nationally and internationally. We plan to increase sales of our Blue Diamond Vodka brand and to develop our other brand names. Increase in sales of our existing brand can be achieved through the improvement in product packaging which has been ongoing, promotional activities, and forming relationships with distributors. We can develop one or more of our other brand names in the next six to twelve months.  Product development  Our Blue Diamond Vodka bottle is produced in France and shipped to Northern Europe to the country of Estonia to complete production. Current production of Blue Diamond Vodka includes some noticeable improvements in product packaging.  Funding  We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  We paid for the second production run of 1,229 cases of Blue Diamond Vodka in February 2015 and we received the product in September 2015. Existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the sale of our common stock to investors. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of equity or debt securities. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  Material Commitments  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any material commitments.  Purchase of Significant Equipment  We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Going Concern  The report of the independent registered public accounting firm accompanying our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Blue Diamond Vodka, a premium vodka brand, was awarded a Double Gold medal in an international spirits competition held annually in New York City. “We are honored that Blue Diamond Vodka has been recognized as a superior brand in international spirits competitions,” said Mr. Lucero. “We are proud of the quality and smoothness of our European vodka, which has been awarded by judges in this prestigious spirits competition for outstanding flavor and smoothness,” he noted. Vodka Brands Corp. continues to work towards expanding product distribution, according to Mr. Lucero. “Our immediate objective is to increase product distribution and sales throughout the United States, and internationally, with this award-winning vodka brand,” he said. “Our long-term goals include the addition of other premium vodka brands to our corporate portfolio.” Blue Diamond Vodka is presented in a frosted bottle and plush velvet pouch. It is currently available for sale in the states of Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Vodka Brands Corp. is a publicly traded company headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

While whiskey, rum, gin and tequila continue to grow their shares of the market, vodka continues to remain the most popular liquor of choice for today's drinkers.
The vodka market itself is continually growing. Every month it seems as if a new brand is launching or a new flavor is released and this trend shows no sign of...MORE stopping.
 However, amid the chaos that is vodka, there are a number of brands that have risen to the top and have become household names. These giants of the vodka world can be found on every liquor store shelf and back bar throughout the world. They are reliable, their portfolios are often filled with fun (and funky) flavors and they rarely disappoint when it comes time to mix up a great vodka cocktail. 
 In the following pages, we will explore those giants of the vodka market. These are not the cheapest of vodkas, but when it comes time to choose a quality, often reasonably priced vodka these are the premium brands that we have come to know and trust.

 Ketel One Vodka 

         Ketel One is one of the smoothest, cleanest vodkas you will find and their portfolio is simple, opting for just two great citrus vodkas. Ketel One Vodka  



If you are seeking out the ultimate of smooth vodkas with no frills, Ketel One is it.  It is truly one of the cleanest vodkas you will come across.
It is almost a shame to mix Ketel One because it is a pure delight when chilled or served over a little ice. It does make some fine cocktails, though, and it is best when kept simple in recipes like the Vodka Martini and Vodka Tonic.
The Ketel One company thrives on the legacy of the Nolet family of Dutch distillers, which are now in the 10th...MORE generation. A family legacy like this is unusual among the big names of the vodka world, though the heritage produces some very fine spirits.
 The brand entered the flavored vodka arena with two citrus flavors, Citroen and Oranje.

 Chopin Vodka 

         Chopin does straight vodka very well and while the brand is known for their Polish potato vodka, they also have rye and wheat vodkas available. Chopin Vodka  



What makes Chopin unique? It is a Polish potato vodka named after the famous composer, Frederic Chopin. If you are looking for one of the smoothest vodkas available this is a great choice.
Potato vodkas are not usually as well received as those distilled from grains, but the quality of Chopin will change anyone's mind about the spud-based liquor. If you want to compare potato and grain vodkas, put this one side-by-side with Ketel One. You will have a great appreciation for both and expand...MORE your palate to recognize each base in the future.
 While its counterparts have expanded to follow the flavored vodka trend, Chopin has remained a clear vodka brand.  When you have a great thing, don't mess with it, and Chopin is without a doubt a great vodka. 
 Instead of exploring flavors, Chopin released both a rye-based and wheat-based vodka and both retain that quality we expect from the top-shelf vodka. 
 In 2014, Dorda Double Chocolate Liqueur was released. This delicious spirit uses Chopin Rye as its base for real Polish chocolate.

 Grey Goose Vodka 

         Grey Goose is a fantastic vodka brand with a few flavors that are perfect for mixing up great cocktails. Grey Goose Vodka  



Grey Goose is a go-to vodka for many. When in doubt, order Grey Goose; it's that simple because you will rarely be disappointed.
Grey Goose is one of the smoothest, most mixable vodkas you can find and it is everywhere. If you do not see this brand at your local bar or liquor store, go somewhere else because any reputable liquor provider should at least have the clear vodka from Grey Goose. This is a staple.
Beyond their clear vodka, Grey Goose produces a nice line of flavored vodkas. The most...MORE impressive is La Poire, their pear-flavored vodka which is a delight in a variety of cocktails.

 Absolut Vodka 

         Absolut Vodkas dominate the modern vodka market and is one of the best known names in the liquor industry. Getty Images News  



Absolut received most of its fame from innovative advertising depicting their vodka bottles in various graphically enhanced and often very conceptual situations. It has worked extremely well for the company and one cannot help but admire their campaigns.
Absolut does give vodka drinkers a quality product. It may not be the best, but it is a good, reliable vodka that has built a name for itself as the leader of the industry. It is a clean tasting vodka that will not (in moderation) leave you...MORE screaming for ibuprofen in the morning.
 One thing that that's great about Absolut is the brand's innovation in flavors. Their city line of flavored vodkas almost always impresses me as they are truly unique flavor combinations that, though they are limited releases, are inspiring for homemade infusions.

 Van Gogh Vodka 

         Van Gogh has an extensive line of vodkas, including many flavors and one gin. Van Gogh Spirits  



When it comes to premium vodkas, Van Gogh is undoubtedly one of the most popular and their product range tops out at over 20 different vodkas. Even though it began as a Dutch gin distillery, this brand is one of the best you will find when it comes to vodka.
The clear Van Gogh is a benchmark in vodka and is smooth, clean and refreshing. Though, if you really want a vodka treat you have to check out Van Gogh Blue, a triple wheat vodka that  is profoundly smooth and surprisingly flavorful.
When it...MORE comes to flavored vodka, Van Gogh has almost anything you can imagine. You will find the typical flavors like orange, mango, citrus and pomegranate, but you will also find some decadence in their espresso, chocolate and caramel vodkas as well.

 Belvedere Vodka 

         Polish vodkas are known for their smooth, clean taste and Belvedere Vodka is one of the best examples with some fun flavors. Belvedere Vodka  



Belvedere is one very fine Polish vodka that comes in an elegant frosted bottle which looks great on display in the bar.
The original, clear bottling is the flagship of the brand and is an excellent choice for high-end cocktails. Its unique taste comes from the use rye, making it a vodka with a flavor backbone.
The brand is not as well-known for the rest of their product line, though they are experimenting with some nice flavored vodkas. Each is elegant and gentle and the list includes citrus,...MORE pink grapefruit, mango passion, lemon tea, and wild berry.includes citrus, pink grapefruit, mango passion, lemon tea, and wild berry.
 Belvedere also regularly releases a handful of specialty bottles. Unfiltered and Intense (100 proof) are two of their standards. The brand likes to play with special, limited edition bottles including (Belvedere) Red, Night Saber and Silver Saber, which are little more than fancy ways to serve their signature vodka at night clubs.

 Stolichnaya Vodka 

         A perfect example of premium Russian vodka, Stolichnaya Vodkas are reliable and the flavors are perfect for cocktails. Stolichnaya Vodka  



Stolichnaya (better known as Stoli) is a perfect everyday premium vodka that is great for mixing in cocktails. This is one of the best Russian vodkas on the worldwide market and you can usually find most of their flavors right alongside the clear Stoli.
One thing you will notice about this brand is that the flavored vodkas have a decidedly Russian flare to their names. If you see Peachik, Strasberi or Oranj you can probably figure out that they are peach, strawberry and orange respectively. All...MORE of the flavors have this unique spelling and they are all quite pleasant-tasting as well.
 In just the past few years Stoli has grabbed onto the dessert vodka craze with the release of bottlings like Sticki, Chocolat Razberi and Salted Karamel. They also have Hot, one of the few commercial jalapeno vodkas available.

 Hangar 1 Vodka 

         Hangar 1 Vodka produces some very fine flavored and one clear vodka that are ideal for the best cocktails. Hangar 1 Vodka  



There are two elements that make Hangar One different from the other popular premium vodkas. It is distilled from both Viognier grapes and Midwestern grains and is produced in an abandoned Navy aircraft hangar (thus the name).
The grapes are an interesting base distillate that only a few vodkas take on (most notably Ciroc). It takes skill to get it right, and Hangar One hit the nail on the head with their distillation.
This is one of the newer brands in the list, but it is quickly becoming the...MORE call vodka of choice for many people.
 They also have some interesting flavors: Citron "Buddha's Hand", Kaffir Lime and Mandarin Blossom.

 Three Olives Vodka 

         Three Olives Vodka has a fun collection of flavored vodkas. Three Olives Vodka  



Three Olives' line of vodka is one of our favorites to experiment with. You'll have a lot of fun coming up with new drinks from their creative flavors, though at times it is a challenge.
Three Olives has a wonderful clear vodka and the flavors no vodka company can be without like berry and citrus. However, if you look at the numerous flavors in their product line, you will find some of the funkiest flavors ever imagined in the vodka world.
Some of the unique finds include Triple Shot Espresso,...MORE which is a wallop of caffeine and flavor, and their root beer vodka is simply tasty, though limited in its uses and availability. This is also the only brand ​that has thought of tomato vodka, though that one quickly left the scene.
 Loopy, Tartz, Dude and even Elvis Presley Coconut Water make up some of the brand's proprietary flavors and while they are not for the vodka connoisseur, they are, well... interesting and fun for those who are exploring the sweet vodka trend.

We will not receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by selling
shareholders.


We believe that we compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and
distribution strength. We compete with other alcoholic beverages for consumer
purchases, as well as for shelf space in retail stores and restaurant presence.
We compete with numerous local, national, multinational producers and
distributors of beverage alcohol products, selling products in Pennsylvania,
many of which have greater resources than us. There is no n assurance we will
not be able to compete effectively.


Company Description
We import and distribute a 40% proof grain based vodka under the Blue Diamond
trade name. In Pennsylvania, alcoholic beverages can only be sold to the state
of Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who acts as a distributor and supplier of
the product. As such, our sole customer is the Pennsylvania


 Liquor Control
board who then resells the product at state owned liquor stores and individual
liquor retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and
other outlets that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages.

We are dependent on the state of Pennsylvania not only for sales but also for
product placement and retail store distribution. We have no distribution
agreements or minimum sales requirements with the State of Pennsylvania and they
are under no obligation to distribute our vodka products. The state of
Pennsylvania also distributes the products and brands of our competitors.
