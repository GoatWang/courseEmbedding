'God Bless the Prince of Wales' is the story of the town of Scarborough and the Prince of Wales and other hotels in the town during WWII. Hotels were requisitioned to train RAF aircrew. Some of the 6,000 aircrew who trained in the town, recall their training and what they went on to do. Blackouts, rationing, evacuees, queuing for silk stockings, young men who rowed across the North Sea to assist our War effort, heroism, air raids, incendiaries, injury, and death are mentioned and there are many touches of humour. 
 Also mentioned is the Lancaster bomber which ‘buzzed’ the town; the Lysander plane which crashed killing both pilots; pilot training on Oliver’s Mount for clandestine operations; bravery and heroism in the air and on the ground; the Resistance in Italy near Monte Cassino; and did Hitler really instruct the Luftwaffe not to bomb the Grand Hotel as he wanted to make it his Reich Chancellery had he won the war?
With 240 pages and many photographs this book is... More > a fascinating read.< Less

Prints in 3-5 business days

In 2009 after publication of my last book - National Service, Elvis & Me! – I planned to write another book. But fate intervened and after self-publishing my previous books demand grew from others who wanted help to get their own books into print. 
Whilst we were busy publishing books for others, I appealed for anecdotes and stories to include in Why Should England Tremble. Over 60 people generously submitted contributions, but it was only in March 2012, on a tranquil island, near Luxor in Egypt, that I was able to start shuffling the entries and putting the book together.
Why Should England Tremble? is the result - a Miscellany of Anecdotes, Facts, Humour & Memories which have come from many individuals and sources. 
I do hope you enjoy reading this book which I feel it is the sort of light hearted book you can pick up and laugh at and put down in between reading the more serious stuff.
