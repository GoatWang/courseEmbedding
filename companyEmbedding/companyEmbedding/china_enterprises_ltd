The Company













China Enterprises Limited, 
                              a Bermuda corporation (the "Company", 
                              which term shall include, when the context so requires, 
                              the subsidiaries of the Company as defined below), 
                              incorporated on January 28, 1993, is a holding company 
                              whose shares are traded on the OTC Securities Marketplace in United States of America. 
                              The Company conducts its principal businesses in 
                              various parts of the Greater China Region. However, 
                              the Company carries on business in Hong Kong under 
                              the commercial name of "China Tire Holdings 
                              Limited" due to local company registration 
                              considerations.
 
                              The principal place of business of the Company is 
                              located at Unit 703, 7/F., 1063 King's Road, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong and its telephone 
                              number is (852) 3151-0300.








Important 
                              Events in The Development of The Company's Business
 
                              Since the early 90's, the Company started out to 
                              be an investment holding company which owns majority 
                              interests in a number of Sino-foreign equity joint 
                              venture enterprises in the People's Republic of 
                              China (the "PRC") involving in the production 
                              and trading of vehicles tires and related rubber 
                              products in the PRC and overseas.
The 
                              Company had started considering and exploring new 
                              directions and alternatives for the future of its 
                              business since the middle of year 2000. Pursuant 
                              to special resolutions passed at the 2000 annual 
                              general meeting held on June 27, 2000 and the 2001 
                              annual general meeting held on May 31, 2001, respectively, 
                              the name of the Company was first changed from "China 
                              Tire Holdings Limited "to "China Tire 
                              e-commerce.com Limited" and later changed 
                              to "China Enterprises Limited".
 
                              The name changes were the result of the strategic 
                              review of the Company's investments in light of 
                              the impending structural changes occurring in the 
                              business environment of the Greater China Region. 
                              With its changing political and socio-economic landscape, 
                              it is imperative that the Company expands its vision 
                              to encompass investments in other high growth industries 
                              in the region. Going forward, the Company intends 
                              to actively search for potential investments in 
                              the Greater China Region with emphasis on achieving 
                              a diversified portfolio.

 Exhibit 99.1 
CHINA ENTERPRISES LIMITED ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF AGREEMENT TO 
PURCHASE SHARES OF MILLION CUBE LIMITED
HONG KONG. March 27, 2015. China Enterprises Limited (“China Enterprises” or the “Company”; Pink Sheets: CSHEF) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Wealth Faith Limited (“Wealth Faith”) has successfully closed its previously announced a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”) with Fortuneasy Limited (“Fortuneasy”).  As previously announced, the Agreement provides for the purchase by Wealth Faith of 40% of the shares of Million Cube Limited (“Million Cube”) from Fortuneasy. The total purchase price for the shares being acquired by Wealth Faith is HK$200 million or approximately US$25.8 million. The Company, through Wealth Faith, has previously deposited HK$154.8 million or approximately US$19.9 million in earnest money with Fortuneasy, which was applied toward the purchase price.		          
As provided in the Agreement, Million Cube acquired 45% of the issued share capital and corresponding shareholder loans of Paragon Winner Company Limited (“Paragon”).  Paragon was formed to invest in a joint venture that has developed the Sanya Sun Valley Golf Resort in Yalong Bay, Sanya City, People’s Republic of China and that is seeking to develop a related hotel and resort complex at such resort. 		          
While the parties originally anticipated the transaction to close in late 2012 or 2013, the transaction was subject to regulatory approvals, and the obtaining of such approvals took longer than originally anticipated.		          
As previously described, the shares of Million Cube held by Wealth Faith are subject to certain transfer restrictions, including rights of first refusal benefiting Fortuneasy.  In addition, as an investor in Million Cube, Wealth Faith may be required under the terms of the Agreement to loan additional funds to Million Cube should Million Cube’s board of directors determine that either Million Cube or Paragon lacks sufficient financial resources to meet capital requirements.  Wealth Faith has appointed one director to Million Cube’s board of directors.

The tire market in the People's Republic of China continued its strong growth in fiscal year 2003.  Along with the rapid development of the PRC economy and the implementation of the construction of "five vertical and seven horizontal" National Trunks System by the Chinese government, the development of roads and highways accelerated in 2003 and resulted in increased demand for motor vehicles and vehicle-related components, including tires.
Consolidated revenues arising from continuing operations amounted to Rmb2.81 billion, representing a 7.6% increase over the fiscal year 2002 revenues of Rmb2.61 billion. This was mainly due to an increase in sales volume, especially in the radial tire market. The demand for radial tires has remained high since 2001 and Hangzhou Zhongce continues to increase its productive volume of radial tires. It sold a total of 5.3 million units of vehicle tires, 35.0 million units of bicycle tires and 2.3 million units of wheelbarrow tires in the nine-month period ended of fiscal 2003.
Loss from continuing operations increased to Rmb99.6 million in 2003 compared to a loss of Rmb62.9 million in 2002. This is mainly contributed by the equity in losses of affiliates amounting to Rmb120.2 million. 
Loss from discontinued operations decreased to Rmb7.8 million in the fiscal year 2003 from Rmb199.8 million in fiscal year 2002 which was mainly due to the loss on disposal of Yinchuan CSI and CSI Rubber.
For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a consolidated net loss of Rmb107.3 million. This represents a 59.2% decrease compared with Rmb262.8 million in 2002. These improvements resulted mainly from divestitures of non-performing assets and business in 2002 and early 2003.
The Annual General Meeting for China Enterprises will be held in Hong Kong on June 29, 2004.  Based on the record date of April 8, 2004, the Company will dispatch a notice of the meeting and a proxy statement to shareholders in due course.

                    Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2002 have been 
                    restated from amounts previously reported to reflect the
                    effect of discontinued operations as of June 30, 2002. Please 
                    refer to Note 1 to the attached Financial Highlights for details. 
                    
In the first half of 2003, China Enterprises generated revenues of Rmb1.7 billion compared to the restated revenues of Rmb1.2 billion for the corresponding period in the previous year. It increased its net loss by 4.8% to Rmb24.2 million. The loss incurred during the period was mainly attributable to the share of losses in its travel business related affiliate company. The travel business in the Greater China Region was dampened by the outbreak of the SARS in first half of 2003. However, the business rebounded in the second half of the year as the unfavorable effects of the epidemic subsided. 
In January 2003, the Company disposed of its entire interest in Yinchuan C.S.I. (Greatwall) Rubber Co., Limited ("Yinchuan CSI") for a consideration of Rmb35.0 million and recognized a gain on disposal of Rmb5.0 million. Subsequently, the Company disposed of its remaining interest in Double Happiness Tyre Industries Corporation Limited ("Double Happiness"), including an incomplete radial tire factory, to an independent third party for a consideration of Rmb10.0 million in June 2003, and resulting in a gain on disposal of Rmb11.0 million. The completion of the sale is pending upon certain approvals from the government authorities; however, the Company effectively transferred control and substantially all its risks and benefits of ownership of the factory to the buyer after receiving the total sale proceeds. On June 15, 2003, the Company entered into a contract with an independent third party, Hangzhou Industrial & Commercial Trust & Investment Co., Limited, for disposal of a 25% interest in Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., Limited ("Hangzhou Zhongce"), currently a 51% owned subsidiary of the Company, for a consideration of Rmb164.7 million in order to widen the shareholders' base of Hangzhou Zhongce. The Company considers the sale to be beneficial both to the further development of Hangzhou Zhongce in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC") and its future value to the Company. The sale is conditional upon the parties receiving approval of the transaction from the China Commercial Department, an agency of the government of the PRC. 
For 
                    details of the unaudited consolidated results of the Company 
                    and its subsidiaries for the six months ended June 30, 2003,

Unaudited Interim Results for the six months ended June 30, 2002. 
 
                  HONG KONG, September 25, 2002 China Enterprises Limited ("the 
                  Company") (NYSE: CSH) announced today its unaudited condensed 
                  consolidated results for the six months ended June 30, 2002.
Financial 
                  Highlights

Revenues, 
                  operating income, loss from continuing operations and loss from 
                  discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 
                  have been restated from amounts previously reported to reflect 
                  the effect of discontinued operations as of June 30, 2001. Please 
                  refer to Note 1 to the attached Financial Highlights for details.
For 
                  the period under review, the Company has successfully diversified 
                  its business outside the tire manufacturing and trading sectors 
                  through the acquisition of a substantive stake in Ananda Wing 
                  On Travel (Holdings) Limited ("Ananda"), a leading 
                  travel operator based in Hong Kong whose shares are listed on 
                  The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The investment was 
                  accounted as an investment in affiliate companies in the interim 
                  results.
In 
                  the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company entered into 
                  a share transfer agreement with a third party to dispose of 
                  its entire interest in Yantai CSI and the respective shareholder's 
                  advance of Rmb20.2 million for an aggregate consideration of 
                  Rmb25.5 million. The approval from the relevant governmental 
                  authorities has been obtained in late January 2002 and the Company 
                  transferred substantially all its risks and benefits of ownership 
                  of Yantai CSI to the buyer. The Company recognized a net realized 
                  gain on such disposition of Rmb7.8 million and has ceased to 
                  account for the results of operations and the assets and liabilities 
                  of the factory from the disposal date. The sale proceeds were 
                  fully received by the Company in cash in August 2002.
In 
                  January 2002, the Company also signed a transfer agreement to 
                  sell its entire interest in Shandong Synthetic to its Chinese 
                  joint venture partner for a consideration of Rmb10,000. The 
                  sale was considered as completed in July 2002 as approval from 
                  the relevant governmental authorities has been obtained and 
                  the Company transferred substantially all its risks and benefits 
                  of ownership of the factory to the buyer in early July 2002.
During 
                  the period, tire prices remained flat amidst the highly competitive 
                  tire market but the prices of major raw materials such as natural 
                  rubber and nylon cord have moved up. Despite the above, the 
                  Company was able to maintain a 7.2% revenue growth with revenue 
                  climbed up to Rmb1.46 billion as compared to the Rmb1.36 billion 
                  recorded in the same period last year due to the Company efforts 
                  to reorganize its product strategy into marketable and higher 
                  margin products and discontinue those of lower profit margins. 
                  There was a notable increase in the sales of radial tires of 
                  22.1% and bicycle tires of 18.3%. Gross profit margin improved 
                  from 12.97% to 13.49%. The Company was able to control the rising 
                  cost of production while benefiting from the sales of higher 
                  margin products at the same time. However, it is worth noting 
                  that the tension in the Middle East may lead to an upward trend 
                  in crude oil prices as well as a continuing price increase in 
                  the natural rubber prices. In view of the above, the present 
                  profit margin achieved for these six months may not be maintained 
                  unless general market selling prices can be adjusted to compensate 
                  for the rising production costs. 
Compared 
                  to the same period last year, selling and administrative expenses 
                  decreased by 27.6% to Rmb114.9 million. This significant improvement 
                  can be attributed to: the discontinuance of free delivery services, 
                  management's stringent cost cutting efforts and the implementation 
                  of more efficient and effective administrative and marketing 
                  strategies.
Loss 
                  from continuing operations increased to Rmb27.0 million compared 
                  to Rmb1.5 million last year. It comprises an impairment loss 
                  provision for the long-lived assets of Yinchuan CSI amounting 
                  to Rmb174.4 million due to continued recurring losses incurred 
                  by Yinchuan CSI, a gain of Rmb37.1 million upon an increase 
                  in fair value of the convertible options in the convertible 
                  note of Ananda and the Company's share of losses of Ananda in 
                  an amount of Rmb3.6 million since its acquisition on April 19, 
                  2002. The downturn of the Hong Kong economy and the September 
                  11, 2001 incident led to a general decrease in consumer consumption 
                  in Hong Kong and a change of customer's preference to short 
                  distance journeys. In addition, the second quarter of a year 
                  is generally a low season in the travel industry. All these 
                  facts contributed to affect the performance of Ananda in the 
                  quarter results. 
Income 
                  from discontinued operations increased to Rmb3.9 million in 
                  the half year ended 2002 compared with a loss of Rmb16.6 million 
                  in the half year ended 2001. It represented the operating results 
                  of the radial tire factory of Double Happiness, Shandong Synthetic 
                  and Yantai CSI up to the disposal date and a gain on disposal 
                  of Yantai CSI amounting to Rmb7.8 million in the first half 
                  year of 2002.
For 
                  the half-year ended June 30, 2002, the Company recorded a consolidated 
                  net loss of Rmb23.1 million (2001: Rmb18.0 million).
In 
                  late August 2002, the Company decided to reengineer the operation 
                  of Yinchuan CSI. The Company is actively engaged in negotiations 
                  with its Chinese joint venture partner to formulate different 
                  alternatives for the future operations of Yinchuan CSI. No concrete 
                  plan has yet been agreed among all parties as at the report 
                  date.
The 
                  New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") informed the Company 
                  on September 19, 2002 that the NYSE intends to suspend trading 
                  in the Company's Common Stock prior to the Exchange's opening 
                  on September 27, 2002 for a failure to meet the NYSE's continuing 
                  listing standards. The Company intends to request a review of 
                  the NYSE's decision according to NYSE appeal procedures. Following 
                  the review, if the Company is unsuccessful in its appeal, the 
                  NYSE may apply to the SEC to delist the Common Stock from the 
                  NYSE.

                  to Financial Highlights
1. During 
                  the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company decided to 
                  dispose of certain of its subsidiaries which included Double 
                  Happiness, Yantai CSI and Shandong Synthetic, which have previously 
                  been reported under the operating results in June 30, 2001.
Accordingly, 
                  the operating results of Double Happiness, Yantai CSI and Shandong 
                  Synthetic have been segregated from continuing operations and 
                  reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statement 
                  of operations. The Company has also restated its last half year's 
                  consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss

NYSE's intention to suspend its trading in common Stock
 
                  New York, September 19, 2002. China Enterprises Limited (NYSE 
                  Symbol: CSH) announces that the New York Stock Exchange informed 
                  the Company today that the NYSE intends to suspend trading in 
                  the Company's common stock prior to the Exchange's opening on 
                  Friday, September 27, 2002 for failure to meet the NYSE's continuing 
                  listing standards. The Company intends to request a review of 
                  the NYSE's decision according to NYSE appeal procedures. Following 
                  the review, if the Company is unsuccessful in its appeal, the 
                  NYSE may apply to the SEC to delist the common stock from the 
                  NYSE. 

As 
                  the Company previously announced on March 4, 2002, the Company 
                  received a notice from the NYSE that the Company was not in 
                  compliance with the NYSE requirement of an average global market 
                  capitalization of at least $15,000,000 over a consecutive 30 
                  trading day period. The Company submitted a business plan to 
                  the NYSE designed to bring the Company into compliance with 
                  the continuing listing standards. Despite the plan, the Company 
                  has recently fallen below the NYSE's continuing listing standard 
                  requiring an average closing price of its common stock of at 
                  least $1.00 for a consecutive 30 trading day period. 

As 
                  of this time, the Company intends to appeal the NYSE's suspension 
                  and is exploring its options.

The 
                  Company, formerly known as China Tire e-commerce.com Ltd., is 
                  a holding company for a number of Sino-foreign equity joint 
                  venture enterprises and two other international joint ventures, 
                  which manufacture and market tires in China and other countries 
                  abroad. The Company also has a substantial interest in an investment 
                  holding company the subsidiaries of which are principally engaged 
                  in the business of providing package tours, travel, transportation 
                  and other related services.

                  will bear interest at the rate of 2% per annum payable semi-annually 
                  in arrears. China Enterprises may convert the Note into ordinary 
                  shares of Ananda at a rate per share equal to HK$0.032, subject 
                  to adjustments, at any time prior to the Note's maturity date, 
                  which will be two years from the date the Note is issued. 
 
                In addition, Hutchison International Limited, Capital Strategic 
                Investment Limited and Sinolink Worldwide Holdings Limited each

                travel, transportation and other related services.
China 
                Enterprises believes the investment in Ananda is a positive step 
                in diversifying the company's business. The Company expects the 
                travel industry in the People's Republic of China to expand after 
                the PRC'a accession to the World Trade Organization.
 
                Completion of the Subscription is conditional upon, amongst other 
                things, Million Good receiving from the Securities and Futures 
                Commission in Hong Kong, a waiver (the "Waiver") of

                of Ananda under The Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers; the

                governmental authorities in Hong Kong, Bermuda and the United 
                States. China Enterprises' obligations under the Note will be 
                conditional upon, amongst others things, the Subscription becoming 
                unconditional.

                of the Subscription will take place on the third business day 
                after fulfillment or waiver of the conditions under the subscription

Transporter, Rescue and the limited edition silver chrome Eagles have identical boxes. Presentation box is 35.5 x 17.5 x 13cm (25.5 including flap). The model is mounted in clear plastic on a red cardboard base, decorated like a launch pad; there is a folded 70cm long card backdrop with a painting of Moonbase Alpha, also seen on the box sides and rear. The box artwork is a little cartoonish, especially the Eagles on the front and rear. They have obviously distorted nose cones (in contrast to the accurate model itself). The flap has a large "Space: 1999" logo, with a Gerry Anderson "Century 21"-inspired roundel design. The Freighter and Cargo boxes are almost identical, with a description under the logo (other sides of the box still say "Eagle Transporter").



The rear of the box has text in a Main Mission Big Screen (Roberto Baldassari's artwork): Product Enterprise Ltd is proud to present a highly detailed replica of the Eagle Transporter as a metal diecast collector's edition. With detachable central pod, this stunning model captures the essence of this classic spacecraft from Space 1999.



Art for the rear of the box. 

 
The models were also available from Aoshima, a Japanese model company. The Aoshima boxes are similar to the old Imai Eagle model kit art (although it is actually a photo of the model). Unlike the Product Enterprise boxes, the Transporter and Rescue Eagles have different boxes, although to the same design. The small photos on the side are the same as the Imai too. The English caption says 1/72 scale/ diecast model/ high quality details. The underside of the boxes have pictures of the model in plan and side profiles. Inside the contents (model, launch pad base and Moonbase card backdrop) are identical. It is a little more expensive than the UK version (US$93 vs US$73).

The most impressive Eagle model to date. The model is a third larger than the Dinky Eagle, but without the obvious plastic framework, green and blue paint, or the major simplifications to the design. It is similar in size to the Airfix/MPC Eagle plastic construction kit, but without the need to rebuild it with "accurising" kits (and no model-making expertise is required). The legs do not have spring suspension, but are authentically detailed. The pod release is practical but subtle.
  
Variations
The chrome and gold plated Eagles were obviously aimed at collectors rather than fans. The gold Eagle came in a box with plush red lining, looking rather like a coffin.




The Rescue/Medical Eagle red stripes are too thin. The stripes should be the same width as the space between them.
The Freighter pod has a slightly different mechanism, and is the only one with an instruction leaflet ungrammatically titled "Instructions Of Detach Or Attach The Freighter Pod". Oddly, the Freighter is painted inaccurately in two different shades of gray.
The Laboratory Eagle was released individually and as part of a Gift Set (announced for July 2006 but delayed until November 2006). It is very accurate apart from the placement of the Moonbase Alpha decals.
The VIP Eagle is a representation of Simmonds's Eagle from Breakaway, seen very briefly. This was a "limited edition of 4000", due August 2006, released November 2006

 Exhibit 99.1 
CHINA ENTERPRISES LIMITED ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF AGREEMENT TO 
PURCHASE SHARES OF MILLION CUBE LIMITED
HONG KONG. March 27, 2015. China Enterprises Limited (“China Enterprises” or the “Company”; Pink Sheets: CSHEF) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Wealth Faith Limited (“Wealth Faith”) has successfully closed its previously announced a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”) with Fortuneasy Limited (“Fortuneasy”).  As previously announced, the Agreement provides for the purchase by Wealth Faith of 40% of the shares of Million Cube Limited (“Million Cube”) from Fortuneasy. The total purchase price for the shares being acquired by Wealth Faith is HK$200 million or approximately US$25.8 million. The Company, through Wealth Faith, has previously deposited HK$154.8 million or approximately US$19.9 million in earnest money with Fortuneasy, which was applied toward the purchase price.		          
As provided in the Agreement, Million Cube acquired 45% of the issued share capital and corresponding shareholder loans of Paragon Winner Company Limited (“Paragon”).  Paragon was formed to invest in a joint venture that has developed the Sanya Sun Valley Golf Resort in Yalong Bay, Sanya City, People’s Republic of China and that is seeking to develop a related hotel and resort complex at such resort. 		          
While the parties originally anticipated the transaction to close in late 2012 or 2013, the transaction was subject to regulatory approvals, and the obtaining of such approvals took longer than originally anticipated.		          
As previously described, the shares of Million Cube held by Wealth Faith are subject to certain transfer restrictions, including rights of first refusal benefiting Fortuneasy.  In addition, as an investor in Million Cube, Wealth Faith may be required under the terms of the Agreement to loan additional funds to Million Cube should Million Cube’s board of directors determine that either Million Cube or Paragon lacks sufficient financial resources to meet capital requirements.  Wealth Faith has appointed one director to Million Cube’s board of directors.

The closing of the transaction is subject to, among other things, the Company and Wealth Faith satisfactorily completing due diligence and the receipt of all necessary governmental and other consents.

Following the closing of the transaction and under the terms of the Agreement, the shares of Million Cube held by Wealth Faith will be subject to certain transfer restrictions, including rights of first refusal benefiting Fortuneasy.  In addition, as an investor in Million Cube, Wealth Faith may be required under the terms of the Agreement to loan additional funds to Million Cube should Million Cube’s board of directors determine that either Million Cube or Paragon lacks sufficient financial resources to meet capital requirements.  Wealth Faith will have the right to appoint one director to Million Cube’s board of directors so long as it holds any shares in Million Cube.

Operating loss decreased to Rmb16.8 million in 2006 compared to Rmb27.5  million in 2005. This was mainly due to the increase in our administrative  expenses during the fiscal year 2005 in relation to certain legal and  professional costs incurred on the transaction acquiring the property situated  in Shanghai, the PRC, which did not recur in 2006.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a  consolidated net loss of Rmb21.2 million, or Rmb2.35 per share.  By comparison, the net loss and the net loss  per share in 2005 was Rmb26.3 million and Rmb2.92, respectively.   The  loss for the fiscal year 2006 consisted primarily of a loss upon a decrease in  fair value of the call option associated with the convertible note of Wing On  totaling Rmb19.5 million, general and administrative expenses amounted Rmb16.8  million, and partially offset with the Company’s share of net profit of  Hangzhou and Wing On in an amount of Rmb3.3 million and interest income of  Rmb12.3 million.
The Annual General Meeting for the Company will be held in Hong Kong on December  31, 2007.  Based on the record date of November  15, 2007, the Company will dispatch a notice of the meeting and a proxy  statement to shareholders in due course.

The tire market in the People's Republic of China continued its strong growth in fiscal year 2003.  Along with the rapid development of the PRC economy and the implementation of the construction of "five vertical and seven horizontal" National Trunks System by the Chinese government, the development of roads and highways accelerated in 2003 and resulted in increased demand for motor vehicles and vehicle-related components, including tires.
Consolidated revenues arising from continuing operations amounted to Rmb2.81 billion, representing a 7.6% increase over the fiscal year 2002 revenues of Rmb2.61 billion. This was mainly due to an increase in sales volume, especially in the radial tire market. The demand for radial tires has remained high since 2001 and Hangzhou Zhongce continues to increase its productive volume of radial tires. It sold a total of 5.3 million units of vehicle tires, 35.0 million units of bicycle tires and 2.3 million units of wheelbarrow tires in the nine-month period ended of fiscal 2003.
Loss from continuing operations increased to Rmb99.6 million in 2003 compared to a loss of Rmb62.9 million in 2002. This is mainly contributed by the equity in losses of affiliates amounting to Rmb120.2 million. 
Loss from discontinued operations decreased to Rmb7.8 million in the fiscal year 2003 from Rmb199.8 million in fiscal year 2002 which was mainly due to the loss on disposal of Yinchuan CSI and CSI Rubber.
For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a consolidated net loss of Rmb107.3 million. This represents a 59.2% decrease compared with Rmb262.8 million in 2002. These improvements resulted mainly from divestitures of non-performing assets and business in 2002 and early 2003.
The Annual General Meeting for China Enterprises will be held in Hong Kong on June 29, 2004.  Based on the record date of April 8, 2004, the Company will dispatch a notice of the meeting and a proxy statement to shareholders in due course.

                    Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2002 have been 
                    restated from amounts previously reported to reflect the
                    effect of discontinued operations as of June 30, 2002. Please 
                    refer to Note 1 to the attached Financial Highlights for details. 
                    
In the first half of 2003, China Enterprises generated revenues of Rmb1.7 billion compared to the restated revenues of Rmb1.2 billion for the corresponding period in the previous year. It increased its net loss by 4.8% to Rmb24.2 million. The loss incurred during the period was mainly attributable to the share of losses in its travel business related affiliate company. The travel business in the Greater China Region was dampened by the outbreak of the SARS in first half of 2003. However, the business rebounded in the second half of the year as the unfavorable effects of the epidemic subsided. 
In January 2003, the Company disposed of its entire interest in Yinchuan C.S.I. (Greatwall) Rubber Co., Limited ("Yinchuan CSI") for a consideration of Rmb35.0 million and recognized a gain on disposal of Rmb5.0 million. Subsequently, the Company disposed of its remaining interest in Double Happiness Tyre Industries Corporation Limited ("Double Happiness"), including an incomplete radial tire factory, to an independent third party for a consideration of Rmb10.0 million in June 2003, and resulting in a gain on disposal of Rmb11.0 million. The completion of the sale is pending upon certain approvals from the government authorities; however, the Company effectively transferred control and substantially all its risks and benefits of ownership of the factory to the buyer after receiving the total sale proceeds. On June 15, 2003, the Company entered into a contract with an independent third party, Hangzhou Industrial & Commercial Trust & Investment Co., Limited, for disposal of a 25% interest in Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., Limited ("Hangzhou Zhongce"), currently a 51% owned subsidiary of the Company, for a consideration of Rmb164.7 million in order to widen the shareholders' base of Hangzhou Zhongce. The Company considers the sale to be beneficial both to the further development of Hangzhou Zhongce in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC") and its future value to the Company. The sale is conditional upon the parties receiving approval of the transaction from the China Commercial Department, an agency of the government of the PRC. 
For 
                    details of the unaudited consolidated results of the Company 
                    and its subsidiaries for the six months ended June 30, 2003,

                  advance of Rmb20.2 million for an aggregate consideration of 
                  Rmb25.5 million. The approval from the relevant governmental 
                  authorities has been obtained in late January 2002 and the Company 
                  transferred substantially all its risks and benefits of ownership 
                  of Yantai CSI to the buyer. The Company recognized a net realized 
                  gain on such disposition of Rmb7.8 million and has ceased to 
                  account for the results of operations and the assets and liabilities 
                  of the factory from the disposal date. The sale proceeds were 
                  fully received by the Company in cash in August 2002.
In 
                  January 2002, the Company also signed a transfer agreement to 
                  sell its entire interest in Shandong Synthetic to its Chinese 
                  joint venture partner for a consideration of Rmb10,000. The 
                  sale was considered as completed in July 2002 as approval from 
                  the relevant governmental authorities has been obtained and 
                  the Company transferred substantially all its risks and benefits 
                  of ownership of the factory to the buyer in early July 2002.
During 
                  the period, tire prices remained flat amidst the highly competitive 
                  tire market but the prices of major raw materials such as natural 
                  rubber and nylon cord have moved up. Despite the above, the 
                  Company was able to maintain a 7.2% revenue growth with revenue 
                  climbed up to Rmb1.46 billion as compared to the Rmb1.36 billion 
                  recorded in the same period last year due to the Company efforts 
                  to reorganize its product strategy into marketable and higher 
                  margin products and discontinue those of lower profit margins. 
                  There was a notable increase in the sales of radial tires of 
                  22.1% and bicycle tires of 18.3%. Gross profit margin improved 
                  from 12.97% to 13.49%. The Company was able to control the rising 
                  cost of production while benefiting from the sales of higher 
                  margin products at the same time. However, it is worth noting 
                  that the tension in the Middle East may lead to an upward trend 
                  in crude oil prices as well as a continuing price increase in 
                  the natural rubber prices. In view of the above, the present 
                  profit margin achieved for these six months may not be maintained 
                  unless general market selling prices can be adjusted to compensate 
                  for the rising production costs. 
Compared 
                  to the same period last year, selling and administrative expenses 
                  decreased by 27.6% to Rmb114.9 million. This significant improvement 
                  can be attributed to: the discontinuance of free delivery services, 
                  management's stringent cost cutting efforts and the implementation 
                  of more efficient and effective administrative and marketing 
                  strategies.
Loss 
                  from continuing operations increased to Rmb27.0 million compared 
                  to Rmb1.5 million last year. It comprises an impairment loss 
                  provision for the long-lived assets of Yinchuan CSI amounting 
                  to Rmb174.4 million due to continued recurring losses incurred 
                  by Yinchuan CSI, a gain of Rmb37.1 million upon an increase 
                  in fair value of the convertible options in the convertible 
                  note of Ananda and the Company's share of losses of Ananda in 
                  an amount of Rmb3.6 million since its acquisition on April 19, 
                  2002. The downturn of the Hong Kong economy and the September 
                  11, 2001 incident led to a general decrease in consumer consumption 
                  in Hong Kong and a change of customer's preference to short 
                  distance journeys. In addition, the second quarter of a year 
                  is generally a low season in the travel industry. All these 
                  facts contributed to affect the performance of Ananda in the 
                  quarter results. 
Income 
                  from discontinued operations increased to Rmb3.9 million in 
                  the half year ended 2002 compared with a loss of Rmb16.6 million 
                  in the half year ended 2001. It represented the operating results 
                  of the radial tire factory of Double Happiness, Shandong Synthetic 
                  and Yantai CSI up to the disposal date and a gain on disposal 
                  of Yantai CSI amounting to Rmb7.8 million in the first half 
                  year of 2002.
For 
                  the half-year ended June 30, 2002, the Company recorded a consolidated 
                  net loss of Rmb23.1 million (2001: Rmb18.0 million).
In 
                  late August 2002, the Company decided to reengineer the operation 
                  of Yinchuan CSI. The Company is actively engaged in negotiations 
                  with its Chinese joint venture partner to formulate different 
                  alternatives for the future operations of Yinchuan CSI. No concrete 
                  plan has yet been agreed among all parties as at the report 
                  date.
The 
                  New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") informed the Company 
                  on September 19, 2002 that the NYSE intends to suspend trading 
                  in the Company's Common Stock prior to the Exchange's opening 
                  on September 27, 2002 for a failure to meet the NYSE's continuing 
                  listing standards. The Company intends to request a review of 
                  the NYSE's decision according to NYSE appeal procedures. Following 
                  the review, if the Company is unsuccessful in its appeal, the 
                  NYSE may apply to the SEC to delist the Common Stock from the 
                  NYSE.

Notes 
                  to Financial Highlights
1. During 
                  the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company decided to 
                  dispose of certain of its subsidiaries which included Double 
                  Happiness, Yantai CSI and Shandong Synthetic, which have previously 
                  been reported under the operating results in June 30, 2001.
Accordingly, 
                  the operating results of Double Happiness, Yantai CSI and Shandong 
                  Synthetic have been segregated from continuing operations and 
                  reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statement 
                  of operations. The Company has also restated its last half year's 
                  consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
                  to present the operating results of these subsidiaries as discontinued

NYSE's intention to suspend its trading in common Stock
 
                  New York, September 19, 2002. China Enterprises Limited (NYSE 
                  Symbol: CSH) announces that the New York Stock Exchange informed 
                  the Company today that the NYSE intends to suspend trading in 
                  the Company's common stock prior to the Exchange's opening on 
                  Friday, September 27, 2002 for failure to meet the NYSE's continuing 
                  listing standards. The Company intends to request a review of 
                  the NYSE's decision according to NYSE appeal procedures. Following 
                  the review, if the Company is unsuccessful in its appeal, the 
                  NYSE may apply to the SEC to delist the common stock from the 
                  NYSE. 

As 
                  the Company previously announced on March 4, 2002, the Company 
                  received a notice from the NYSE that the Company was not in 
                  compliance with the NYSE requirement of an average global market 
                  capitalization of at least $15,000,000 over a consecutive 30 
                  trading day period. The Company submitted a business plan to 
                  the NYSE designed to bring the Company into compliance with 
                  the continuing listing standards. Despite the plan, the Company 
                  has recently fallen below the NYSE's continuing listing standard 
                  requiring an average closing price of its common stock of at 
                  least $1.00 for a consecutive 30 trading day period. 

As 
                  of this time, the Company intends to appeal the NYSE's suspension 
                  and is exploring its options.

The 
                  Company, formerly known as China Tire e-commerce.com Ltd., is 
                  a holding company for a number of Sino-foreign equity joint 
                  venture enterprises and two other international joint ventures, 
                  which manufacture and market tires in China and other countries 
                  abroad. The Company also has a substantial interest in an investment 
                  holding company the subsidiaries of which are principally engaged 
                  in the business of providing package tours, travel, transportation 
                  and other related services.

                On Travel (Holdings) Limited
Hong 
                Kong, February 8, 2002. China Enterprises Limited (NYSE Symbol: 
                CSH) announces that on February 1, 2002, the Company, through 
                its wholly-owned subsidiary, Million Good Limited, agreed to subscribe

                shares of Ananda Wing On Travel (Holdings) Limited for an aggregate 
                subscription price of HK$129,600,000. Ananda is a Hong Kong based 
                travel company, whose ordinary shares are listed on the Hong Kong

                of shares to Million Good, China Enterprises, through Million 
                Good, will own approximately 34.6% of the outstanding share capital 
                of Ananda. 
As 
                  part of the transaction, China Enterprises agreed to purchase 
                  a two-year convertible note (the "Note") to be issued 
                  by Ananda in the principal amount of HK$120,000,000. The Note 
                  will bear interest at the rate of 2% per annum payable semi-annually 
                  in arrears. China Enterprises may convert the Note into ordinary 
                  shares of Ananda at a rate per share equal to HK$0.032, subject 
                  to adjustments, at any time prior to the Note's maturity date, 
                  which will be two years from the date the Note is issued. 
 
                In addition, Hutchison International Limited, Capital Strategic 
                Investment Limited and Sinolink Worldwide Holdings Limited each 
                also agreed to acquire similar two-year convertible notes issued

                and HK$50,000,000, respectively. 
Following 
                the issuance of the shares and assuming full conversion of all 
                four of the notes and no further issuances of shares by Ananda 
                other than pursuant to the transactions referred to in this press 
                release, China Enterprises and Million Good would collectively 
                own approximately 33.6% of the outstanding shares of Ananda, and 
                Hutchison, Capital Strategic and Sinolink Worldwide would own 
                approximately, 18.5%, 6.1% and 6.1%, respectively, of the outstanding 
                share capital of Ananda.

                Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. It mainly provides package tours, 
                travel, transportation and other related services.
China

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
