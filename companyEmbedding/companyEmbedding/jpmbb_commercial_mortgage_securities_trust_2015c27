Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2015-C29 Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2015-C29 Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust
    





May 29, 2015 12:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on JPMBB Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust 2015 C29 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$49,025,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$212,993,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60,000,000 class A-3A1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$75,000,000b class A-3A2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$222,921,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69,203,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$753,133,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,147,000a class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63,991,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,147,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,302,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$162,440,000 class EC 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,917,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,302,000ab class X-C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,917,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20,920,000ab class X-E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,075,000ab class X-F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20,920,000b class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,075,000b class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of May 29, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $47,994,178ab X-NR 
      and $47,994,178b NR classes.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 63 loans secured by 85 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $984.5 
      million as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank plc, RAIT Funding, LLC, 
      Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation, and Starwood Mortgage Funding 
      II, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 65.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 73.8%, and asset summary reviews on 86.2% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The transaction has lower leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      of 1.22x is greater than both the YTD 2015 average of 1.18x and the 2014 
      average of 1.19x, and the pool's Fitch LTV of 108.0% is lower than both 
      the YTD 2015 average of 110.4% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans in the transaction account for 
      43.2% of the pool by balance. This is lower than the YTD 2015 average of 
      48.5% and lower than the 2014 average of 50.5%. The pool's below-average 
      concentration resulted in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 292, which 
      was lower than the YTD and 2014 averages of 387 and 331, respectively. 
      Two of the six largest loans (9.25% of the pool) are secured by 
      properties located in Houston.
    

      Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 13.9% of the initial 
      pool balance prior to maturity, which is greater than the 2014 average 
      of 12.0%. Six loans (17.5%) are full-term interest-only and 33 loans 
      (49.12%) are partial interest-only. One loan (1.54%) is fully 
      amortizing. The remaining 23 loans (31.8%) are amortizing balloon loans 
      with loan terms of five to 10 years.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 13.0% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 
      2015-C29 certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

 Item 1117
of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.

  

 The
registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving
the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine
litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties,
and the following, with respect to Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as trustee, certificate administrator and
custodian:

 

On June
18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil
complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee
under 276 residential mortgage backed securities
(“RMBS”) trusts, which was later amended on July 18,
2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts.  On
November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily
dismiss the state court action without prejudice.  That same
day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (the “District Court”) against Wells Fargo Bank,
alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274
RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”). In December 2014, the
plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original
state court action was granted.  As with the prior state court
action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed
contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank,
HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of
institutional investor plaintiffs.  The Complaint against
Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to
investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other
things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of
representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged
events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan
servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care
following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money
damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and
equitable relief.  Other cases (collectively, the
“Additional Complaints”) alleging similar causes of
action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees
in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other
transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the
same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection
with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise
jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the
District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints
if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed.
There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or
the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS
trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes
that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good
faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to
investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to
contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously. 

 

 Item 1119
of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions.

  

 The
information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a
prospectus supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing

Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria
 
Midland Loan Services (“Midland”), a division of PNC
Bank, National Association, is responsible for assessing compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d)
of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Regulation AB”), as set forth in Appendix A.
 
Midland has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the
“Reporting Period”). In making this assessment, Midland
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB.
This report covers all transactions serviced on the
Enterprise! Loan Management System (the
“Platform”).
 
Midland engaged certain vendors, which are not servicers as defined
in item 1101(j) of Regulation AB (the “Vendors”), to
perform specific, limited or scripted activities related to
portions of the servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix
A.  Midland elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria or portion of the servicing
criteria applicable to such Vendors’ activities as set forth
in Appendix A. Midland has not identified and is not aware of any
material instances of noncompliance by the Vendors with the
applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2015 and for the
Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole, nor
has it identified any material deficiencies in  its policies
and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the
applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2015 and for the
Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.
 
Based on this assessment, Midland believes that, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2015, Midland has complied in all material
respects with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB.
 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on
Midland’s assessment of compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the  year ended December 31,
2015.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING
CRITERIA 
 
The management (“ Management ”) of the Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the “ Company ”) is responsible for assessing
the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the
servicing platform for the period as follows:
  
Period :  As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2015 (the “ Period ”).
  
Platform :  The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities (“ CMBS ”)
transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration and/or paying agent services and where some or all
of the offered securities for such CMBS transactions were either
(a) publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement delivered
under the Securities Act of 1933, or (b) privately-issued pursuant
to an exemption from registration where the Company has an
obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions (i) where the offered securities
were issued, sponsored or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government sponsored
entity, and (ii) where the offered securities were issued pursuant
to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which
the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as
defined by Regulation AB) (the “ CMBS Platform
”).  Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the CMBS
Platform for the Period.
  
Applicable Servicing Criteria :  All servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) applicable to the Company’s
obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to
the CMBS Platform for the Period, except for the following
servicing criteria:  1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company
performed with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period;
provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a)
servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable to the activities
the Company performs related to the aggregation of information
received and the conveyance of such information as required by the
transaction agreements for certain transactions, including those
transactions issued on or before November 23, 2015, where
compliance for such activities was previously assessed under other
servicing criteria in accordance with the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance’s Manual of Publicly Available
Interpretations on Regulation AB and Related Rules, Interpretation
11.03 and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable
only to the activities the Company performs related to the process
of making or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the
asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
“ Applicable Servicing Criteria ”). 
  
Third parties classified as vendors :  With respect to
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor
to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing functions required
by the servicing criterion.  Management has determined that
this vendor is not considered a “servicer” as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the
servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the
SEC’s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (formerly SEC Manual Telephone
Interpretation 17.06) (“ C&DI, 200.06
”).  The Company has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor’s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criterion applicable to the vendor.  Management is solely
responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC
requirements to apply C&DI, 200.06 for the vendor and related
criterion.
 
With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management
provides the following assessment of the Company’s compliance
with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
1.     Management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.
2.    Management has assessed the Company’s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on
C&DI, 200.06, as described above.  In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB. 
3.    With respect to applicable servicing criteria
1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the Period with respect
to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events
that would require the Company to perform such activities.
 
4.    Based on such assessment for the Period, the
Company has complied, in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. 
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report with respect to Management’s
assessment of the Company’s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING
CRITERIA
 
 
The management (“ Management ”) of the Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the “ Company ”) is responsible for assessing
the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the
servicing platform for the period as follows:
  
Period :  As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2015 (the “ Period ”).
  
    
Platform :  The  platform  consists of
residential mortgage-backed securities (“ RMBS
”) transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans
and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“ CMBS
”) transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans,
in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services and where the RMBS and CMBS transactions were either (a)
publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b)
privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from registration on or
after January 1, 2006 where the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions
where the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government
or any government sponsored entity, other than certain
securitizations of residential mortgage loan transactions issued,
sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Company (the “ Document Custody Platform
”).  Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period.
  
Applicable Servicing Criteria :  Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii),
1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii)
are applicable to the Company’s obligations in the related
transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody
Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only as it relates to the Company’s obligation to
review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the
transaction agreements (the “ Applicable Servicing
Criteria ”).  Management has determined that all
other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not
applicable to the Document Custody Platform.
 
With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period,
Management provides the following assessment of the Company’s
compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
 
1.  Management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.
 
2.  Management has assessed the Company’s compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.  In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB.
 
3.  With respect to applicable servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the Period with respect
to the Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities.
 
4.  Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has
complied, in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.
 
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report with respect to Management’s
assessment of the Company’s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.
