Review This Product














                'Another stimulating and in depth reflection on an issue facing people of Christian faith today from Brian Harris. He identifies the potential of faith turning ugly although many in the church are in denial of this. The writer also highlights the well known figures who have concluded that faith is too toxic and ugly to be anything other than destructive such as Marx, Hitchens and Freud and responds well to their arguments. Perhaps the greatest value of this book for the Christian leader or follower of Christ are the 3 sets of tools which are offered: the indicators that faith is straying from its true role and is not as life giving as God intended; the signs that church leadership is becoming toxic and the pointers to a faith which is healthy and life building. His development of the importance of orthopathy alongside orthodoxy and orthopraxy are significant. As people of faith we need to have the correct attitude and feelings alongside the correct belief and actions.


This book will be useful for ministers, lay leaders and network pastors who would be helped by understanding why faith does at times appear toxic. The Good News of Christ, which of itself is the most liberating and compelling message, can in the hands of those with shallow thinking or personal insecurities become something dangerous. Brian gives us good insight in reflecting in depth on this matter.' 


- Dianne Tidball, Regional Minister, East Midlands Baptist Association

- Dianne Tidball, Regional Minister, East Midlands Baptist Association 
- Koorong

:Following the huge success of The Tortoise Usually Wins, 2012, and The
 Big Picture, 2015, in When Faith Turns Ugly Brian Harris explores why
 the Christian faith sometimes wears two masks - usually life-serving and
 transforming, but occasionally escapist, illusionary and even poisonous.
 What are the warning signs that faith is at risk of turning toxic? What do
 we mean by the conviction that the gospel liberates? Brian Harris' take on
 what constitutes life-serving faith is refreshing and will be appreciated by
 all who would like to be sure that their obedience to Jesus the Christ will
 help to build a world with a better name.

A Robust Faith










Brian C Houston



23 December 2015








Part 4: A Glorious Future
Day 12
Message: A Robust Faith


Oh! Teach us to live wisely and well…
Psalm 90:12 (Message)
The key to your glorious future is in your faith. It is one thing to say you believe, and quite another to act on what you believe as though it is already true.
What do you do when you are praying for something and things appear unchanged or even deteriorating? That’s when you discover whether you have developed faith that refuses to quit or let go of the promises of God’s Word. To survive life’s harshest blows your faith must be robust, and resilient. The word robust means “strong and healthy; hardy and vigorous.”
Hebrews 11 begins by defining its focus: “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good testimony”(v1-2). These elders of the faith included Noah, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Rahab, Samuel, David and many others. Their “good testimony” is the legacy of faith they left, the story of how they trusted God in the midst of overwhelming ordeals and obstacles. They were not a superior species but normal men and women with fears and faults. Clearly, it wasn’t their strength that caused the victories. It was actually despite their weaknesses that God enabled them to do amazing feats: conquer kingdoms, overcome lions, quench fires, dodge swords, and win battles when overwhelmingly outnumbered (Heb. 11:33–34). That is definitely courageous faith!
The Bible frequently talks about a “fight” of faith. Romans 8:37 calls us “more than conquerors”, and if so then we know that we will face mountains and battles that we must conquer. How can we be overcomers if there is nothing to overcome? If life had no hurdles or challenges, faith would have no purpose. It is easy to have faith when everything is going well, but courageous and robust faith is forged only through testing.
To move into your glorious future, there will be times when you will need to have courageous and robust faith. No doubt, you will have opportunities to exercise the courage to share your faith, to do the right thing, to live well, lead well and love well in the face of challenges, and hold firm to God’s promises. 

Prayer: Lord, I won’t be dismayed when challenges come. The Word of God says that my faith will be refined by the fire and Your strength is made perfect in my weakness.
2 Corinthians 12:9, 1 Peter 1:7, Romans 5:4 (Amp)

Description



Description
A book that masterfully weaves together biblical exposition and practical application, to demonstrate how emotions relate to the Christian life.
Emotions are a vital part of what it means to be a human being made in the image of God and redeemed in Jesus Christ. But often our emotions confuse and mislead us. So what is the proper place for emotions in a Christian’s walk of faith?
In Feelings and Faith Brian Borgman draws from his extensive biblical knowledge and his pastoral experience to help readers understand both divine and human emotions. After laying a biblical foundation he moves on to practical application, focusing on how Christians can put to death ungodly emotional displays and also cultivate godly emotions.
This biblically informed, practical volume is helpful for pastors, counselors, and serious-minded Christians who wish to develop a full-orbed faith that encompasses their emotional life.
“Brian Borgman has written a wonderfully Christ-centered and God-glorifying book about how, by God’s grace, to restore your emotions to God’s image. Feelings and Faith paints a biblically accurate picture of, as the Puritan pastors expressed it, ‘holy emotions.’ It does not dismiss emotions as some do nor does it worship emotions as some do. This is an important book and I highly recommend it.” — Martha Peace, Biblical Counselor; author, The Excellent Wife
“Here is a readable but comprehensive study that unites in biblical friendship the Christian’s theology and experience. With the heart of a pastor, Brain Borgman offers an emotional life line that will stabilize your heart and support your faith. Faith and Feelings needs to be in your personal library. I will return to it time and again-so will you!” — Jani Ortlund, Executive Vice President, Renewal Ministries; author, Fearlessly Feminine and His Loving Law, Our Lasting Legacy
“As Christians, who hasn’t been confused about the relationship between our faith and our feelings? Are feelings an incredibly important part of your faith, giving you heart-felt ways to express love to God and others, or are they actually to be jettisoned from your faith, being perceived as something dangerous in your relationship to Christ? In this immensely profitable book, Brian Borgman, a very sure-footed guide to this topic, biblically and precisely explains the concept of emotion and how it is to be integrated into one’s walk with the Lord. I know of no other book quite like it. All at once, it is Scriptural, wise, clear, pastoral, transparent, and compelling. This is a great resource for instance, for a pastor who desires help in skillfully shepherding his sheep. It is also a wonderful help for a discipler and/or counselor who wants to instruct his disciples and counselees with their fears, worries, and anxieties. Even further, the principles in this work should prove to be of real, lasting value to any believer in Jesus who earnestly yearns to first grasp and then harness his or her own emotions within the context of a sensate culture that is quickly careening out of emotional control. For all who read this book, we should genuinely applaud Pastor Borgman’s diligent efforts in now bringing us the most helpful volume available on the subject of Faith and Feelings.” — Lance Quinn, Pastor-Teacher, The Bible Church of Little Rock, Little Rock, Arkansas

Product Description▼▲
How do we find faith in our materialistic culture? Is it possible to believe in Christ? Brian Draper approaches the subject in an imaginative, poetic way, drawing on images from contemporary culture to help present the case for Christianity. Section one (The Way) examines who Jesus was, the path we should choose, and the radical challenge of following Jesus. Section two (The Truth) looks at our broken world, how to find real peace, and authenticity. Section three (The Life) answers questions such as "Must I go to church to be a Christian?" and "How do I make the most of my life?"
