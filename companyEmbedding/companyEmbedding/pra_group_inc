History[edit]
PRA Group began as Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC in March 1996[4] by co-founders CEO and President Kevin Stevenson and Steve Fredrickson. They started with four people out of a small office in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The company's debt purchasing activities began a few months after the company was formed, in May 1996.[5]
In 2000, the company reported that it had purchased US$1,000,000,000 of debt during the year, ranking (tying) in 10th place among top debt buyers.[6] By 2010, the company was noted as "the sixth-largest debt buyer in the U.S."[7]
PRA Group's initial public offering was in 2002 and was backed by William Blair & Company and Piper Jaffray.[3][8][9] The company is listed on the NASDAQ exchange and traded under the symbol PRAA.[10]
PRA's SEC filings for 2015 state that PRA has large international operations, due to its acquisitions of Aktiv Kapital, a Norway-based debt buyer and lender in Europe and Canada.
Company name[edit]
The name of the company when formed was Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC.[4] On an unknown date, the company's name changed to Portfolio Recovery Associates, Inc.[citation needed] Then in October 2014, the name changed to PRA Group, Inc.[11] The PRA Group name and the design of its corporate logo were trademarked in 2014.[12]
Litigation[edit]
In 2014, the Attorney General of New York obtained a settlement against PRA Group "for repeatedly bringing improper debt collection actions against New York consumers."[13] The case involved "uncontested default judgments" levied against defendants who failed to respond to suits brought by PRA against them.[13] The settlement required abandonment of claims against debtors (amounting to millions of dollars), changes in collection practices, and a civil fine of US$300,000.[13] In September, 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -the regulator of the debt buying industry, made public a Consent Order against PRA, which was detailed in PRA's 2015 Annual Report to the SEC. As part of the Consent Order, PRA received a substantial fine and penalty, and must make restitution to some of its customer due to a variety of questionable debt collection practices.
Adverse Regulatory Actions[edit]
In September 2015, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Portfolio Recovery to pay $19 million in consumer refunds and an $8 million penalty, and stop collecting on over $3 million worth of debts. Portfolio is also barred from reselling debts to third parties in the future.
The CFPB found that Portfolio Recovery Associates threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, stated incorrect balances, interest rates, and payment due dates in attempting to collect debts from consumers. Failed to provide documention on debts. Filed court cases they knew they had no documentation for in hopes a consumer would default on their court date giving portfolio a default judgement. Portfolio filed cases on debts that they knew were outside the statute of limitations. Threatened that they were going to sue when an attorney had not even reviewed the case and made misrepresentations among other things.[14]
PRA's SEC filings for the calendar year 2015, page 92 and elsewhere, detail that the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit of PRA of tax years 2005 to 2012. The IRS is currently in litigation with PRA, and there is a tax claim of at least $197 million against PRA that is now pending in U.S Tax Court. This matter is now set for trial in September, 2016.
Business model[edit]
PRA's business model is based on purchasing pools of consumer debt from banks and other creditors, at a discount to the full amount owed. The company then tries to recover two to three times the purchase price over a period of years.[15]
The company applies predictive computational models when considering acquisition of a debt portfolio to help assess the potential return on investment, as well as on its existing portfolio to conduct ongoing review of its collection strategy.[16]
Corporate governance[edit]
PRA was co-founded by CEO and President Kevin Stevenson and Steve Fredrickson in 1996. Corporate governance is as follows:

Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors —Steven Fredrickson (BA, University of Denver; MBA, University of Illinois)[17]
President and Chief Executive Officer — Kevin Stevenson
CEO, PRA Group Europe —Tiku Patel

Board of directors[edit]
The executive chairman of the board of directors is Steven Fredrickson. As of 2014[update], Jim Nussle was among members of the company's board of directors.[18]
Operations[edit]
The company's headquarters are located in Norfolk, Virginia.[19]
In 2001, the main facility of the company was in the Riverside Commerce Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which employed 380 "collectors/supervisors".[5]
In 2000, the company established a call center in Hutchinson, Kansas.[20] By late 2001, this facility employed 75.[5]
The overall employment figure for 2002 was 590, across all sites and divisions.[8]
Also by 2002, about 50% of the company's debt portfolio (the spectrum of debts purchased) had come from major credit card issuers Visa, MasterCard and Discover.[8] The overall portfolio had a "face value" (the amount owed) of US$4,170,000,000 across 1.5 million individual accounts.[8]
As shown in its 2015 SEC filings, for the year ending December 31, 2015, PRA had revenues of $942 million, and $880 million in 2014.
As shown in the SEC filings by PRA for the calendar year 2015, PRA has substantial international operations from its acquiring Aktiv Kapital of Norway.
Subsidiaries[edit]
PRA Group's subsidiaries include Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, which purchases and collects debt; PRA Receivables Management, LLC, which acquires and services bankrupt and insolvent accounts; PRA Location Services, which helps auto lenders and insurance companies recover missing collateral; and Claims Compensation Bureau (CCB), which monitors and files class action claims on behalf of institutional investors and corporate clients.[21][22][23]

History[edit]
PRA Group began as Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC in March 1996[4] by co-founders CEO and President Kevin Stevenson and Steve Fredrickson. They started with four people out of a small office in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The company's debt purchasing activities began a few months after the company was formed, in May 1996.[5]
In 2000, the company reported that it had purchased US$1,000,000,000 of debt during the year, ranking (tying) in 10th place among top debt buyers.[6] By 2010, the company was noted as "the sixth-largest debt buyer in the U.S."[7]
PRA Group's initial public offering was in 2002 and was backed by William Blair & Company and Piper Jaffray.[3][8][9] The company is listed on the NASDAQ exchange and traded under the symbol PRAA.[10]
PRA's SEC filings for 2015 state that PRA has large international operations, due to its acquisitions of Aktiv Kapital, a Norway-based debt buyer and lender in Europe and Canada.
Company name[edit]
The name of the company when formed was Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC.[4] On an unknown date, the company's name changed to Portfolio Recovery Associates, Inc.[citation needed] Then in October 2014, the name changed to PRA Group, Inc.[11] The PRA Group name and the design of its corporate logo were trademarked in 2014.[12]
Litigation[edit]
In 2014, the Attorney General of New York obtained a settlement against PRA Group "for repeatedly bringing improper debt collection actions against New York consumers."[13] The case involved "uncontested default judgments" levied against defendants who failed to respond to suits brought by PRA against them.[13] The settlement required abandonment of claims against debtors (amounting to millions of dollars), changes in collection practices, and a civil fine of US$300,000.[13] In September, 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -the regulator of the debt buying industry, made public a Consent Order against PRA, which was detailed in PRA's 2015 Annual Report to the SEC. As part of the Consent Order, PRA received a substantial fine and penalty, and must make restitution to some of its customer due to a variety of questionable debt collection practices.
Adverse Regulatory Actions[edit]
In September 2015, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Portfolio Recovery to pay $19 million in consumer refunds and an $8 million penalty, and stop collecting on over $3 million worth of debts. Portfolio is also barred from reselling debts to third parties in the future.
The CFPB found that Portfolio Recovery Associates threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, stated incorrect balances, interest rates, and payment due dates in attempting to collect debts from consumers. Failed to provide documention on debts. Filed court cases they knew they had no documentation for in hopes a consumer would default on their court date giving portfolio a default judgement. Portfolio filed cases on debts that they knew were outside the statute of limitations. Threatened that they were going to sue when an attorney had not even reviewed the case and made misrepresentations among other things.[14]
PRA's SEC filings for the calendar year 2015, page 92 and elsewhere, detail that the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit of PRA of tax years 2005 to 2012. The IRS is currently in litigation with PRA, and there is a tax claim of at least $197 million against PRA that is now pending in U.S Tax Court. This matter is now set for trial in September, 2016.
Business model[edit]
PRA's business model is based on purchasing pools of consumer debt from banks and other creditors, at a discount to the full amount owed. The company then tries to recover two to three times the purchase price over a period of years.[15]
The company applies predictive computational models when considering acquisition of a debt portfolio to help assess the potential return on investment, as well as on its existing portfolio to conduct ongoing review of its collection strategy.[16]
Corporate governance[edit]
PRA was co-founded by CEO and President Kevin Stevenson and Steve Fredrickson in 1996. Corporate governance is as follows:

Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors —Steven Fredrickson (BA, University of Denver; MBA, University of Illinois)[17]
President and Chief Executive Officer — Kevin Stevenson
CEO, PRA Group Europe —Tiku Patel

Board of directors[edit]
The executive chairman of the board of directors is Steven Fredrickson. As of 2014[update], Jim Nussle was among members of the company's board of directors.[18]
Operations[edit]
The company's headquarters are located in Norfolk, Virginia.[19]
In 2001, the main facility of the company was in the Riverside Commerce Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which employed 380 "collectors/supervisors".[5]
In 2000, the company established a call center in Hutchinson, Kansas.[20] By late 2001, this facility employed 75.[5]
The overall employment figure for 2002 was 590, across all sites and divisions.[8]
Also by 2002, about 50% of the company's debt portfolio (the spectrum of debts purchased) had come from major credit card issuers Visa, MasterCard and Discover.[8] The overall portfolio had a "face value" (the amount owed) of US$4,170,000,000 across 1.5 million individual accounts.[8]
As shown in its 2015 SEC filings, for the year ending December 31, 2015, PRA had revenues of $942 million, and $880 million in 2014.
As shown in the SEC filings by PRA for the calendar year 2015, PRA has substantial international operations from its acquiring Aktiv Kapital of Norway.
Subsidiaries[edit]
PRA Group's subsidiaries include Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, which purchases and collects debt; PRA Receivables Management, LLC, which acquires and services bankrupt and insolvent accounts; PRA Location Services, which helps auto lenders and insurance companies recover missing collateral; and Claims Compensation Bureau (CCB), which monitors and files class action claims on behalf of institutional investors and corporate clients.[21][22][23]

History[edit]
PRA Group began as Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC in March 1996[4] by co-founders CEO and President Kevin Stevenson and Steve Fredrickson. They started with four people out of a small office in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The company's debt purchasing activities began a few months after the company was formed, in May 1996.[5]
In 2000, the company reported that it had purchased US$1,000,000,000 of debt during the year, ranking (tying) in 10th place among top debt buyers.[6] By 2010, the company was noted as "the sixth-largest debt buyer in the U.S."[7]
PRA Group's initial public offering was in 2002 and was backed by William Blair & Company and Piper Jaffray.[3][8][9] The company is listed on the NASDAQ exchange and traded under the symbol PRAA.[10]
PRA's SEC filings for 2015 state that PRA has large international operations, due to its acquisitions of Aktiv Kapital, a Norway-based debt buyer and lender in Europe and Canada.
Company name[edit]
The name of the company when formed was Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC.[4] On an unknown date, the company's name changed to Portfolio Recovery Associates, Inc.[citation needed] Then in October 2014, the name changed to PRA Group, Inc.[11] The PRA Group name and the design of its corporate logo were trademarked in 2014.[12]
Litigation[edit]
In 2014, the Attorney General of New York obtained a settlement against PRA Group "for repeatedly bringing improper debt collection actions against New York consumers."[13] The case involved "uncontested default judgments" levied against defendants who failed to respond to suits brought by PRA against them.[13] The settlement required abandonment of claims against debtors (amounting to millions of dollars), changes in collection practices, and a civil fine of US$300,000.[13] In September, 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -the regulator of the debt buying industry, made public a Consent Order against PRA, which was detailed in PRA's 2015 Annual Report to the SEC. As part of the Consent Order, PRA received a substantial fine and penalty, and must make restitution to some of its customer due to a variety of questionable debt collection practices.
Adverse Regulatory Actions[edit]
In September 2015, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Portfolio Recovery to pay $19 million in consumer refunds and an $8 million penalty, and stop collecting on over $3 million worth of debts. Portfolio is also barred from reselling debts to third parties in the future.
The CFPB found that Portfolio Recovery Associates threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, stated incorrect balances, interest rates, and payment due dates in attempting to collect debts from consumers. Failed to provide documention on debts. Filed court cases they knew they had no documentation for in hopes a consumer would default on their court date giving portfolio a default judgement. Portfolio filed cases on debts that they knew were outside the statute of limitations. Threatened that they were going to sue when an attorney had not even reviewed the case and made misrepresentations among other things.[14]
PRA's SEC filings for the calendar year 2015, page 92 and elsewhere, detail that the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit of PRA of tax years 2005 to 2012. The IRS is currently in litigation with PRA, and there is a tax claim of at least $197 million against PRA that is now pending in U.S Tax Court. This matter is now set for trial in September, 2016.
Business model[edit]
PRA's business model is based on purchasing pools of consumer debt from banks and other creditors, at a discount to the full amount owed. The company then tries to recover two to three times the purchase price over a period of years.[15]
The company applies predictive computational models when considering acquisition of a debt portfolio to help assess the potential return on investment, as well as on its existing portfolio to conduct ongoing review of its collection strategy.[16]
Corporate governance[edit]
PRA was co-founded by CEO and President Kevin Stevenson and Steve Fredrickson in 1996. Corporate governance is as follows:

Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors —Steven Fredrickson (BA, University of Denver; MBA, University of Illinois)[17]
President and Chief Executive Officer — Kevin Stevenson
CEO, PRA Group Europe —Tiku Patel

Board of directors[edit]
The executive chairman of the board of directors is Steven Fredrickson. As of 2014[update], Jim Nussle was among members of the company's board of directors.[18]
Operations[edit]
The company's headquarters are located in Norfolk, Virginia.[19]
In 2001, the main facility of the company was in the Riverside Commerce Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which employed 380 "collectors/supervisors".[5]
In 2000, the company established a call center in Hutchinson, Kansas.[20] By late 2001, this facility employed 75.[5]
The overall employment figure for 2002 was 590, across all sites and divisions.[8]
Also by 2002, about 50% of the company's debt portfolio (the spectrum of debts purchased) had come from major credit card issuers Visa, MasterCard and Discover.[8] The overall portfolio had a "face value" (the amount owed) of US$4,170,000,000 across 1.5 million individual accounts.[8]
As shown in its 2015 SEC filings, for the year ending December 31, 2015, PRA had revenues of $942 million, and $880 million in 2014.
As shown in the SEC filings by PRA for the calendar year 2015, PRA has substantial international operations from its acquiring Aktiv Kapital of Norway.
Subsidiaries[edit]
PRA Group's subsidiaries include Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, which purchases and collects debt; PRA Receivables Management, LLC, which acquires and services bankrupt and insolvent accounts; PRA Location Services, which helps auto lenders and insurance companies recover missing collateral; and Claims Compensation Bureau (CCB), which monitors and files class action claims on behalf of institutional investors and corporate clients.[21][22][23]

					Full Description



PRA Group, Inc. (PRA Group), incorporated on August 7, 2002, is a financial and business services company with operations in the Americas and Europe. The Company's primary business is the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans. The Company operates through the account receivables management segment. It also provides fee-based services, such as vehicle location, skip tracing and collateral recovery for auto lenders, government entities and law enforcement; revenue administration, audit and revenue discovery/recovery services for local government entities; class action claims recovery services and purchases; servicing of consumer bankruptcy accounts in the United States, and contingent collections of nonperforming loans in Europe and South America.The Company's portfolio of nonperforming loans includes a set of accounts that can be categorized by asset type, age and size of account, level of previous collection efforts, payment history, and geography. It has various receivables of Visa, MasterCard, private label and other credit cards, installment loans, lines of credit, deficiency balances of various types, legal judgments and trade payables. Sellers of nonperforming loans include major banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, telecommunication providers, retailers, utilities, automobile finance companies, student loan companies and other debt owners. It purchases portfolios of accounts that are included in certain types of consumer insolvency proceedings. In Canada, the Company purchases Consumer Proposal, Consumer Credit Counseling and Bankrupt Accounts. In the United Kingdom, it purchases Individual Voluntary Arrangements, Company Voluntary Arrangements, Trust Deeds and Bankrupt Accounts. In Germany, it acquires consumer bankruptcies, which may also consist of small business loans with a personal guarantee.The Company acquires portfolios of nonperforming loans from debt owners through auctions and negotiated sales. In an auction process, the seller will assemble a portfolio of nonperforming loans and will seek purchase prices from specifically invited potential purchasers. In a privately negotiated sale process, the debt owner will contact one or more purchasers directly, receive a bid, and negotiate the terms of sale. In either case, typically, invited purchasers will have already completed a qualification process that can include the owner's reviews of any or all of the purchaser's experience, reputation, financial standing, operating procedures, business practices and compliance oversight. It also acquires portfolios of nonperforming loans through either single portfolio transactions, referred to as spot sales, or through the pre-arranged purchase of multiple portfolios over time, referred to as forward flow sales. Under a forward flow contract, it agrees to purchase nonperforming loans from a debt owner on a periodic basis, at a price equal to a set percentage of face value of the nonperforming loans over a specified time period, generally from 3 to 12 months.The Company acquires portfolios of nonperforming loans from debt owners through auctions and negotiated sales.

Under a forward flow contract, it agrees to purchase nonperforming loans from a debt owner on a periodic basis, at a price equal to a set percentage of face value of the nonperforming loans over a specified time period, generally from 3 to 12 months.A component of the Company's collections effort involves its legal recovery departments and the judicial collection of accounts of customers who have the ability, but not the willingness, to resolve their obligations. Depending on the balance of the receivable and the applicable local collection laws, it determines whether to commence legal action to judicially collect on the receivable. The legal process can take an extended period of time and can be costly, but when accounts are selected properly it also usually generates net cash collections that likely would not have been realized otherwise. The Company uses a combination of internal staff (attorney and support), as well as external attorneys, to pursue legal collections under certain circumstances.In addition to the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans, the Company provides fee-based services, including vehicle location, skip tracing and collateral recovery services for auto lenders and governments through PRA Location Services, LLC (PLS); revenue administration, audit, and revenue discovery/recovery services for government entities through PRA Government Services, LLC and MuniServices, LLC (collectively PGS); class action claims recovery purchasing and servicing through Claims Compensation Bureau, LLC (CCB); contingent collection of finance receivables through PRA Group Europe and RCB, and third-party servicing of bankruptcy accounts in the United States.
