NetAcquire Hardware
NetAcquire systems are powerful real-time
input/output controllers with integrated processing and networking. They provide interfaces
between the "real world" of analog, digital, and PCM
 serial signals
and the "network world" of interconnected data analysis and display
systems. Onboard processor options offer billions of cycles of
processing in ruggedized form-factors as small as hand-held.
All hardware input/output interfaces are modular to allow convenient mix-and-match system configuration to
support almost any application requirement. Expansion is available up to 512
input/output channels and all I/O interfaces are software-configurable without programming.
Hardware configurability allows creation of
a wide range of different instruments, from telemetry gateways to spectrum analyzers
and communications bridges.
A NetAcquire system is designed for autonomous
"always on" operation. No keyboard or monitor connection is required.
Modular network interface hardware allows remote communication with a NetAcquire
system over almost any type of network.
NetAcquire Software
Full-featured and well-integrated software is
essential component of modern-day instrumentation in order to ensure mission-critical reliability, reduced development costs and risk,
and ease-of-use in the field. NetAcquire
systems include all the software needed to work
"out-of-the-box":

High-assurance and controlled
      operating environment for
      mission-critical applications


Distributed
Architecture

NetAcquire systems use the proven client/server 
architecture for optimized real-time data acquisition and control. An 
operational system is composed of two parts: the NetAcquire server and the 
client. Core real-time activities such as data capture, processing and closed 
loop control are executed on the NetAcquire server close to the point of sensor 
connection. The less time-critical activities, such as data display, are located 
on one or more client computers running Windows, Linux, or Java.
The NetAcquire software environment is an open-architecture and allows 
customized extensions to tailor both client and server capabilities.


Server-side
 Core real-time activities such as data capture,
      buffering, processing and closed loop control are executed on the NetAcquire server close
      each hardware interface -- maximizes data quality and ensures timely
      data processing.


Client-side
Data display and operator 
	interfaces are located on one or more desktop computers running Windows or 
	Linux -- allows familiar
      desktop graphic user interfaces with no distance limitation or scalability
      constraints.


Even in applications where
a NetAcquire system is physically close to the desktop operator interface, there are
important benefits to the automatic NetAcquire partitioning of an application onto two
processors each running its own purpose-built software environment.
Server-side Intelligence and Real-Time
Processing



NetAcquire
        Architecture






Click to enlarge






NetAcquire servers are equipped with multi-core 
processors. The advantages of local processing include the ability to do 
real-time data manipulation and simultaneous high-speed communication. The 
real-time operating system avoids the timing limitations inherent in desktop 
operating systems such as Windows. Additionally, high-speed local disk recording 
can preserve critical data for future retrieval.
NetAcquire servers come with a wide range of predefined functions already 
installed, including data processing, routing, analysis, alarming, and display.

Versatile
Networking 
NetAcquire 
networking supports standard unshielded twisted pair Ethernet, fiber optic, and 
even wireless connections.

NetAcquire servers support unlimited simultaneous client 
		connections, sharing data anywhere on the network. Both server and 
		client software use industry-standard protocols and incorporate advanced 
		network routing, error checking, and recovery  if a packet is lost or 
		corrupted, it can be  automatically re-sent.

NetAcquire servers can simultaneously communicate in 
		real-time using multiple protocols including TCP, UDP, publish/subscribe 
		and CORBA distributed objects.
Client-Side Options

NetAcquire "clients" are all other machines on a network that might want to 
exchange data with a NetAcquire system. Client machines often are Windows or 
Linux desktop machines, but also include other types of computers like file 
servers.

NetAcquire client machines often are responsible for operator interface and data 
display. Every NetAcquire system allows convenient graphic configuration and 
monitoring from anywhere on the network using a regular Web browser. Even 
real-time data display and graphing are available from within a browser using 
built-in Java applets.

In addition to the universal Web interface, many other options are available for 
creating user interfaces either with or without programming:
 


Visual
      Basic and Visual C/C++
Highly flexible customized
      interfaces


NI
      LabVIEW
Drag-and-drop icon-based
      graphical user
      interface without programming


NetAcquire
      Windows Client Toolkit
Read and display data directly
      in Microsoft Excel and other Windows programs


NetAcquire
      Java Client Toolkit
Create custom user interfaces
      that are viewable from any Web browser


Satellite Tool
      Kit and IADS
3-D visualization and data
      analysis


TCP/UDP
      sockets
Interface to your existing
      display software from using standard socket calls

NetAcquire Telemetry Over IP


























































































NetAcquireŽ Telemetry-over-IP 
(TMoIP)
Overview
NetAcquire TMoIP reliably distributes any type of telemetry signal across a wide 
range of IP-based networks with very low latency.
The NetAcquire TMoIP option, added to a NetAcquire real-time processor, reads 
typical electrical input signals and converts the resulting data streams into 
Ethernet packets for network transmission. A second NetAcquire server reads the 
data from the network and reconstitutes the data back into the equivalent 
electrical output signals at remote locations. 





Datasheet/Technical Specs













[Click to see

Intelligent TMoIP
NetAcquire TMoIP has many advantages over a 
fixed-mode serial-to-Ethernet device. Now in its seventh generation, the 
NetAcquire product architecture is characterized as Intelligent TMoIP. 
A white paper describing the many additional capabilities available as part of 
NetAcquires Intelligent TMoIP products is available.

Auto-Configuration and Continuous Tuning
NetAcquire TMoIP products automatically adapt to changes in telemetry and 
network conditions, avoiding the need for operator intervention and improving 
system uptime. 
Telemetry data rates are automatically detected and tracked. Network latency and 
jitter are continuously measured and adaptive buffering engages to minimize 
communications latency while ensuring that no data is dropped. 
NetAcquire TMoIP also automatically conserves network bandwidth by detecting 
when telemetry signals are inactive and suppressing generation of unnecessary 
network packets.
Advanced System Management
An advanced top level system management 
capability shows information from the endpoints on each side of the TMoIP 
connection, enabling more effective trouble shooting diagnostics. This top-level 
viewed includes all key system status parameters including network health.
Operator drill-down capabilities provide useful additional information including 
channel status, input/output counts, I/O parameters, error counts, and IRIG 
timing. Serial channel status includes detection and reporting of no data or 
no clock signal electrical conditions which are important for rapid diagnosis 
of external wiring/signal issues. In addition, the actual telemetry data from 
any input channel can be viewed directly from the management interface.
Reliability and Time Correlation
The data integrity and data timing are 
maintained throughout the telemetry distribution process. NetAcquire Intelligent 
TMoIP preserves the timing correlation of the signals from the source side to 
the destination side. Network transport of IRIG A/B/G timing signals is a 
standard capability for NetAcquire TMoIP
systems. If an IRIG timing signal input is supplied, the IRIG output timing is 
accurately reconstituted at each destination.
NetAcquire TMoIP uses agile frequency synthesis and tracking capability on all 
output channels to avoid serial bit slips and data padding that result from 
input-to-output timing mismatch conditions. Frequency resolution is better than 
.0001% (1 part-per-million) across telemetry data rates ranging from 100 bps to 
100 Mbps, resulting in very low jitter. 
Other high-reliability features include automatic reconnection following 
recovery from network failures, quality of service channel prioritization (makes 
sure that most important data goes through the network first), and the ability 
to reconfigure most system properties dynamically without the need for a system 
re-start.  
Network Mesh Flexibility
 NetAcquire Intelligent TMoIP design 
overcomes the restrictions of traditional point-to-point communication products 
by supporting delivery of telemetry data to multiple endpoints simultaneously. 
These sophisticated one-to-many and fully dynamic mesh configurations are 
easily supported.  
Network Data Consumers
 In additional to serial data output, 
NetAcquire Intelligent TMoIP supports simultaneous delivery of telemetry data 
directly to PCs
and other Ethernet devices. 
Integrated telemetry frame synchronization can deliver telemetry data network 
packets that are frame-aligned for ease-of-processing. NetAcquire offers an 
extensive suite of tools for network data archiving, decommutation, and data 
display.
