Objectives & Policies





The Fund's non-fundamental
    investment objective is total return. The
    Fund seeks to achieve this objective from growth
    of capital and from income in any security type and in any industry sector,
    although there is no limitation on the
    percentage or amount of the Fund's assets which may be invested for growth of
    capital or income. Accordingly, at any time the investment emphasis may be
    placed solely or primarily on growth of capital or solely or primarily on
    income. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve this investment
    objective of total return, which will depend primarily on the ability of the Investment Manager to
    predict correctly the direction of financial markets, economic patterns and
    trends, and similar factors.
The Fund invests in securities of
    issuers that the Investment Manager considers to have attractive fundamental and
    technical attributes for potential total return. The Fund exercises a flexible strategy in the selection of securities,
    and is not limited by the issuer's location, size, or market capitalization. The Fund may invest in equity and fixed income securities of new and seasoned U.S. and foreign issuers, including
    securities convertible into common stock, debt securities, futures, options,
    derivatives, and other instruments. The
    Fund also may employ aggressive and speculative investment techniques, such as
    selling securities short and borrowing money for investment purposes, a practice
    known as "leveraging" and may invest defensively in short term, liquid, high
    grade securities and money market instruments. There is a risk that these
    transactions sometimes may reduce returns or increase volatility. In addition,
    derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid and highly sensitive
    to changes in their underlying security, interest rate or index, and as a result
    can be highly volatile. A small investment in certain derivatives could have a
    potentially large impact on the Fund's performance. The Fund may invest in
    debt securities rated below investment grade, commonly referred to as junk
    bonds, as well as investment grade and U.S. Government securities. Generally, investments in securities in the lower rating categories or
    comparable unrated securities provide higher yields but involve greater price
    volatility and risk of loss of principal and interest than investments in
    securities with higher ratings.
