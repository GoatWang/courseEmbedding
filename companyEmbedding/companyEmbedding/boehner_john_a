John Boehner: Sequester Is Product Of Obama's 'Failed Leadership'






By Mollie Reilly

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Tuesday evening, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) blamed President Obama for the nearly $1.2 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts set to go into effect next month, labeling the looming cuts as "the president's sequester." 
"Most Americans are just hearing about this Washington creation for the first time: the sequester," Boehner writes. "What they might not realize from Mr. Obama's statements is that it is a product of the president's own failed leadership."
Boehner continues, "There is nothing wrong with cutting spending that much -- we should be cutting even more -- but the sequester is an ugly and dangerous way to do it." 
The sequester stems from the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandated the cuts if a congressional "super committee" failed to reach an agreement on how to reduce the deficit. In November 2011, the bipartisan group announced it hadn't reached a deal, meaning the cuts to defense and domestic spending would go into effect in January 2013. The sequester was later delayed to begin March 1 as part of the "fiscal cliff" negotiations.
In the op-ed, Boehner slams the president for not offering a "detailed plan that can pass Congress." 
"As the president's outrage about the sequester grows in coming days, Republicans have a simple response: Mr. President, we agree that your sequester is bad policy," Boehner writes. "What spending are you willing to cut to replace it?"
Boehner's latest comments continue the back-and-forth blame game between Republicans and Democrats over the quickly approaching cuts. 
Earlier Tuesday, Obama pushed Congress to pass his plan to offset the cuts, which includes tax increases for the wealthy as well as spending cuts. 
"Republicans in Congress face a simple choice," Obama said. "Are they willing to compromise to protect vital investments in education and health care and national security and all the jobs that depend on them? Or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations?"
In a statement, Boehner pushed back on the president's speech. 
"Just last month, the president got his higher taxes on the wealthy, and he's already back for more," the House Speaker said.

Prison Reform
The U.S. incarcerates its citizens at a rate roughly five times higher than the global average. We have about 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of its prisoners, according to The Economist,. This status quo costs our local, state and federal governments a combined $68 billion a year -- all of which becomes a federal problem during recessions, when states look to Washington for fiscal relief. Over the standard 10-year budget window used in Congress, that's a $680 billion hit to the deficit.

Solving longstanding prison problems -- releasing elderly convicts unlikely to commit crimes, offering treatment or counseling as an alternative to prison for non-violent offenders, slightly shortening the sentences of well-behaved inmates, and substituting probation for more jail-time -- would do wonders for government spending.

Boehner: Republicans won't repeal and replace Obamacare 


                        'They’re basically going to fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it,' Boehner said.

Former House Speaker John Boehner predicted on Thursday that a full repeal and replace of Obamacare is “not what’s going to happen” and that Republicans will instead just make some fixes to the health care law.
Boehner, who retired in 2015 amid unrest among conservatives, said at an Orlando healthcare conference that GOP lawmakers were too optimistic in their talk of quickly repealing and then replacing Obamacare.Story Continued Below






“They’ll fix Obamacare, and I shouldn’t have called it repeal and replace because that’s not what’s going to happen. They’re basically going to fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it,” Boehner said.
The former speaker’s frank comments capture the conundrum that many Republicans find themselves in as they try to deliver on pledges to axe Obamacare but struggle to coalesce around an alternative. 
Republican lawmakers across the country this week are facing angry constituents at town halls worried that Obamacare will be yanked away without a suitable replacement.
President Donald Trump has said in recent days that he will release a plan by early to mid-March on how the administration plans to move forward on repeal-and-replace.
But so far, no clear path has emerged.
Earlier in the panel discussion, Boehner said he “started laughing” when Republicans started talking about moving lightning fast on repeal and then coming up with an alternative.
"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once,” Boehner said. “And all this happy talk that went on in November and December and January about repeal, repeal, repeal—yeah, we'll do replace, replace—I started laughing, because if you pass repeal without replace, first, anything that happens is your fault. You broke it.”

Boehner added that he has told Republican leaders that unless a repeal is packaged with a replacement, GOP lawmakers would not likely reach a consensus about an alternative to Obamacare.
"And secondly, as I told some of the Republican leaders when they asked, I said, if you pass repeal without replace you'll never pass replace, because they will never ever agree on what the bill should be. Perfect always becomes the enemy of the good,” Boehner said.
Boehner said what Republicans ultimately come up with could share a lot of the same qualities with Obamacare.
"Most of the Affordable Care Act, in the framework, is going to stay there: coverage for kids up to age 26, covering those with preexisting conditions. All of that's going to be there. Subsidies for those who can't afford it, who aren't on Medicaid, who I call the working poor, subsidies for them will be there," Boehner said.
"What will be different is that CMS will not dictate to every single state how the plan's going to run. And if the state wants to run an exchange, the state can run an exchange. The states will control the policies that are offered like they control every other insurance product offered in their states,” he added.

John Boehner: I''ve Never Been In A Tanning Bed Or Used A Tanning Product
Addressing the seemingly constant chatter about the orangey-tan color of his skin, House Minority Leader John Boehner told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday that his eye-catching complexion is one hundred percent natural."I have never been in a tanning bed or used a tanning product," explained the ranking Republican. He said that his mother and four of his twelve siblings also have the sun-kissed glow.The explanation comes as only the latest in a string of recent instances where Boehner has found himself playing defense against questions and jokes made about the color of his skin.Earlier this month during an appearance on ABC's "Good Morning America," the House leader was asked about a survey from Public Policy Polling indicating that 30 percent voters in his home state of Ohio think he "spends too much time on his tan."(14 percent of respondents signaled a belief he spends "about the right amount of time" working on his glow, while 4 percent said whatever he's doing isn't enough.)Boehner told GMA host George Stephanopoulos that his critics "probably didn't see me yesterday when I was out cutting my grass or riding my mountain bike."Another possible explanation could be Boehner's love of golf and the reportedly high frequency at which he hits the links.Your request is being processed...tt t t tt John Boehner: I've 'Never Been In A Tanning Bed Or Used A Tanning Product'The Huffington Post   |  Elyse Siegel First Posted: 09-23-10 03:53 PM   |   Updated: 09-23-10 04:10 PM digg facebook Twitter stumble reddit del.ico.us What's Your Reaction?

It was the most unexpected cameo of the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner on Saturday: There, in the video with President Obama, was none other than John A. Boehner, the former House speaker. 
On Monday, White House officials said that Mr. Boehner was a good sport when they called to see if he would join in the comedic tradition of producing a presidential video for the gala dinner.
“As was evident from the finished product, he was an enthusiastic participant in the production,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters.
Filming took place on Friday, just a day before the dinner, and gave the president and his one-time legislative adversary plenty of time to hang out. Mr. Earnest said there was no separate, formal meeting, but he did not deny that they might have talked about current events.
The two men spent time together just a day after Mr. Boehner’s comments about Senator Ted Cruz of Texas — “Lucifer in the flesh” — were reported. Mr. Earnest said, “There was not a detailed discussion of those comments, no.”
But it’s clear they had a good time just from watching the video, especially the part where Mr. Boehner offers Mr. Obama a cigarette and the president’s eyes widen longingly.
“Look, Speaker Boehner has a well-known and very good sense of humor,” Mr. Earnest said. “He made, I think, a very positive contribution to our comedic efforts in the film.”
In a post on Twitter on Monday, Mr. Boehner said he had a good time filming the video with the president and noted that the “cigarette gag was president’s idea! Nice job by @WhiteHouse media team.”

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)  Former House speaker John A. Boehner continued a streak of remarkable post-office candor during a Wednesday appearance at a Houston energy conference, telling a luncheon audience that President Trump’s term has — foreign policy aside — been a “complete disaster.” “Everything else he’s done has been a complete disaster,” Boehner (R-Ohio) said, according to a report in Rigzone, an online energy publication. “He’s still learning how to be president.” Boehner, who resigned from Congress in October 2015, had praised Trump — a friend and golfing companion from his political years — during the presidential campaign. On Wednesday, he praised Trump’s efforts at getting serious about combating the Islamic State terror group, Rigzone reported, but ended his positive comments there. Among other remarks, Boehner said Trump should not be allowed to tweet, the publication said. Dave Schnittger, an aide to Boehner, said Friday the remarks made at the KPMG Global Energy Conference were “reported accurately” by Rigzone. Dan Scavino Jr., the White House social media director, responded Friday evening on Twitter:   John Boehner, is the disaster. pic.twitter.com/N25zG3ompE — Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) May 26, 2017   Boehner has made other public comments critical of his party since leaving office. During the presidential campaign in April 2016, he called then-GOP candidate Ted Cruz “Lucifer in the flesh.” And in February, he made a prescient prediction that a GOP replacement for the Affordable Care Act was “not going to happen” and that “Republicans never, ever agree on health care” — a view he maintained on Wednesday, according to the Rigzone report. Boehner offered other blunt opinions Wednesday, Rigzone reported. He gave an increasingly pessimistic view that congressional Republicans would pass tax reform, saying “now my odds are 60/40” and that tax reform is “a bunch of happy talk.” And he echoed an emerging piece of D.C. conventional wisdom by calling the border adjustment tax plan favored by Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Boehner’s successor as House speaker, “deader than a doornail.” And on the various pending investigations into alleged Russian influence on the election and on Trump’s campaign, Boehner said, “they need to get to the bottom of this” but called impeachment a folly pushed by “crazy left-wing Democratic colleagues of mine.” “Talk of impeachment is the best way to rile up Trump supporters,” he said, according to Rigzone. “Remember, impeachment is not a legal process; it’s a political process.” Boehner, as he has said in the past, repeated Wednesday that he does not miss his old job: “I wake up every day, drink my morning coffee and say, ‘Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,’” he said, according to Rigzone.         powerpost  powerpost     false endOfArticle true          Please provide a valid email address.

John A. Boehner, the former speaker of the House who left Congress and his leadership post last year, is joining Squire Patton Boggs, a Washington-based law firm long known for its lobbying work.However, Mr. Boehner, who served as speaker for four years and as a Republican representative from Ohio for 24 years, will not lobby in his new role at the law firm. Instead, he will serve “as a strategic adviser to clients” in the United States and abroad on global business development, according to the firm’s announcement.“I left the private sector and got into public service decades ago because I wanted to help remove government barriers to economic growth and job creation, and that’s still the mission that drives me,” Mr. Boehner said in a statement on Tuesday.This month, Mr. Boehner, a cigarette smoker, was appointed to the board of the tobacco giant Reynolds American, which is currently fending off more regulation of the industry, including regulation of e-cigarettes. He is to serve on the board’s committee for corporate governance, nominating and sustainability.

In April, Mr. Boehner made a surprise video appearance with President Obama — with whom he had scorching political battles, including a lawsuit House Republicans filed accusing the president of abuse of his official powers — in a humorous vignette for the annual dinner of the White House Correspondents’ Association.In it, Mr. Boehner offered a cigarette to President Obama, who once smoked but says he gave it up; he stuck to that stance in the video.

In his new law firm role, Mr. Boehner will not be working with political adversaries but with a cadre of his former staff members. They include two longtime aides, John Criscuolo and Amy Lozupone, who will join the firm, forming a team that also includes the former speaker’s deputy chief of staff, Dave Schnittger, and former policy adviser, Natasha Hammond.Mr. Boehner, 66, who is not a lawyer and ran a small business in Ohio before his election to Congress, left the speakership at a time of conflicts with conservative members of his own party, who criticized his legislative deal making and called him a sellout.His negotiating skills will be put to use in his new job, where he will have “the opportunity to engage with leaders in business and government throughout the world and help them work through the challenges they face, as part of a world-class team,” he said in his statement.Stephen C. Mahon, the firm’s global managing partner, said there were “few people better equipped than Speaker Boehner to help us take things to the next level and bring our services to clients around the world.”Also among Mr. Boehner’s colleagues will be former Senators John B. Breaux and Trent Lott, who have weathered a number of changes at Squire Patton Boggs, which is among the larger firms in the United States.One of Squire Patton Boggs’s predecessor firms was hit by financial problems and merged two years ago with another law firm. The firm now has about 1,500 lawyers in 46 countries, offering services across North America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia Pacific region and Latin America.

Boehner Predicts Most of Obamacare Will Remain
In a long riff, the former House speaker also criticizes Republicans for not having a plan.
Former House speaker John Boehner, who oversaw multiple attempts to undo Obamacare during his tenure, predicted Thursday that most of President Obama’s health care law "is going to stay there," and that previous talk of repealing and replacing the law amounted to "happy talk."

Former House speaker John Boehner, who oversaw multiple attempts to undo Obamacare during his tenure, predicted Thursday that most of President Obama's health care law "is going to stay there," and that previous talk of repealing and replacing the law amounted to "happy talk."
Boehner told a health care conference in Orlando he was unsure if the GOP's legislating on the issue would resemble the Democrats' strong-arm approach several years prior. But he was more certain of how the substance will look.
"Most of the Affordable Care Act, in the framework, is going to stay there: coverage for kids up to age 26, covering those with preexisting conditions. All of that's going to be there. Subsidies for those who can't afford it, who aren't on Medicaid, who I call the working poor, subsidies for them will be there," Boehner said. "What will be different is that [the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] will not dictate to every single state how the plan's going to run. And if the state wants to run an exchange, the state can run an exchange. The states will control the policies that are offered like they control every other insurance product offered in their states."

He concluded that such an outcome was "not all that hard" to game out. What does add some unpredictability is that Republicans have failed to rally around a single health care reform proposal, for which the former speaker ripped his party.
"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once. And all this happy talk that went on in November and December and January about repeal, repeal, repeal—yeah, we'll do replace, replace—I started laughing, because if you pass repeal without replace, first, anything that happens is your fault. You broke it," Boehner said to applause. "And secondly, as I told some of the Republican leaders when they asked, I said, if you pass repeal without replace you'll never pass replace, because they will never ever agree on what the bill should be. Perfect always becomes the enemy of the good. And so we've got to marry them together."

House Passes Payroll Tax Cut Extension With Keystone Pipeline Provision

WASHINGTON –  Defiant Republicans pushed legislation through the House Tuesday night that would keep alive Social Security payroll tax cuts for some 160 million Americans at President Barack Obama's request -- but also would require construction of a Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline that has sparked a White House veto threat.
Passage, on a largely party-line vote of 234-193, sent the measure toward its certain demise in the Democratic-controlled Senate, triggering the final partisan showdown of a remarkably quarrelsome year of divided government.
The legislation "extends the payroll tax relief, extends and reforms unemployment insurance and protects Social Security -- without job-killing tax hikes," Republican House Speaker John Boehner declared after the measure had cleared.
Referring to the controversy over the Keystone XL pipeline, he added, "Our bill includes sensible, bipartisan measures to help the private sector create jobs."
On a long day of finger pointing, however, Ho

Boehner: Payroll Tax Relief Must Be Paid for With Budget Cuts

WASHINGTON -- Any extension of this year's payroll tax cut must be paid for with savings from elsewhere in the budget, House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. 
Boehner's comment meant that House and Senate Republicans are united in demanding that any eventual measure, which could cost over $100 billion, not add to the federal deficit. It also suggested that President Obama and Congress would have to find mutually acceptable savings before any extension could become law. 
The current tax cut expires Jan. 1. 
Republicans have previously expressed a willingness to try compromising with Obama on ways to create jobs, including renewing the payroll tax cut. But Boehner stopped short of predicting that the two sides will reach agreement on extending this year's 2 percent reduction in the 6.2 percent payroll tax that workers pay or enlarging it, as Obama and many Democrats want.

Congress May Try Blocking Cuts if Debt Panel Fails

WASHINGTON –  Failure by Congress' debt-cutting Super Committee to recommend $1.2 trillion in savings by Wednesday is supposed to automatically trigger spending cuts in the same amount to accomplish that job.
But the same legislators who concocted that budgetary booby trap just four months ago could end up spending the 2012 election year and beyond battling over defusing it.
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., say they are writing legislation to prevent what they say would be devastating cuts to the military. House Republicans are exploring a similar move. Democrats maintain they won't let domestic programs be the sole source of savings.
In the face of those efforts, President Barack Obama has told the debt panel's co-chairmen that he "will not accept any measure that attempts to turn off the automatic cut trigger," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters last week.

Boehner Calls GOP Deficit Plan a 'Fair Offer'

WASHINGTON –  House Speaker John Boehner publicly blessed a Republican deficit-reduction plan Tuesday that would raise $300 billion in additional tax revenue while overhauling the IRS code, bucking opposition by some GOP presidential hopefuls and colleagues wary of violating a longstanding point of party orthodoxy.
Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, spoke as time grew perilously short for agreement by the deficit-fighting "Super Committee." The panel has until a week from Wednesday to vote on any compromise, but several officials said that in reality, perhaps as little as 48 or 72 hours are available to the six Republicans and six Democrats.
While Boehner's voice is important, his endorsement does not mean all Republicans will follow him or that a deal is in sight.

Senate Dems move to repeal DOMA

Senate Democrats and backers of gay marriage won a key victory Thursday in their quest to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, but it’s unclear where it will go next.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 along party lines in favor for the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would repeal the Clinton-era law that defined marriage between a man and a woman.
“Because of DOMA, thousands of American families are now being treated unfairly by the federal government,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). “This unfairness must end.”
Committee Republicans, noting that the bill faces bleak prospects for passing the full Congress, said the measure was a waste of time and the matter should be left up to the states. Six states – Iowa, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, as well as the District of Columbia – now recognize gay marriage.

As Super Committee Deadline Nears, Tax Reforms Become Focus Point

Capitol Hill Republicans say the GOP members of a deficit "Super Committee" are showing flexibility on revenue hikes as the panel heads closer to its Thanksgiving deadline.
GOP aides said Tuesday that among the options floated by Republicans is one that would place limits on the total amount of tax deductions and credits that individuals could claim, in exchange for lower income tax rates. The tradeoff could net hundreds of billions of dollars for the Treasury over the coming decade.
The idea, discussed by Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in talks with Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, is but one of many options on the table.

Boehner: House will have own roads plan

Three days after Senate Republicans blocked President Obama’s latest stimulus spending plan, a $60 billion roads bill, House Speaker John A. Boehner said Sunday that the U.S. House will take action on its own infrastructure package.
“You’re going to see the House move, I think, before the end of the year on an infrastructure bill,” the Ohio Republican said in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC´s “This Week.”
Mr. Boehner said he was confident that the bipartisan supercommittee charged with cutting more than $1 trillion dollars out of the national debt will reach a deal before its Nov. 23 deadline. If the supercommittee cannot work out an agreement, across-the-board cuts to domestic and defense programs would kick in 2013...

The Supercommittee that Wasn't So Super

In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and her traveling companions embark on the Yellow Brick Road in search of the great and powerful Oz. Dorothy believes she can't return to Kansas without the help of the wizard who resides in the Emerald City.
"I am Oz!" the wizard bellows when Dorothy finally gains an audience with him. But the gig is up once Toto reveals that the wizard is simply a man barking into a microphone and pulling a bunch of levers. That creates the illusion of an intimidating and all-powerful wizard.
"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!" the man implores.
To no avail.
"You're a very bad man," Dorothy scolds.
"Oh, no my dear. I'm a very good man," the man pleads. "Just a very bad wizard."
Turns out, he wasn't a wizard at all. Just Oscar Diggs of Omaha, NE. With no special powers to brag of.

A moment of dénouement is a signature of all good films, plays and literature.

Boehner Won't Rule Out 'Balanced Budget Amendment' That Permits Unlimited Federal Spending

(CNSNews.com) – House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) indicated at a press briefing Thursday that the House Republican leadership is not ruling out the possibility that it will support a balanced budget amendment that does not cap federal spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product or require a supermajority in Congress to increase taxes.
The legislation to increase the federal debt limit--that Boehner negotiated with President Barack Obama in August--requires both houses of Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment before the end of the year. However, the legislation does not specify what type of balanced budget amendment must be considered in that vote.
Conservative analysts have argued that an amendment to the Constitution that requires Congress to balance the federal budget but does not require Congress to limit federal spending to a set percentage of GDP or to muster supermajorities to raise taxes would be a formula for bigger government and higher taxes...
