Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Construction Lawyers: Construction law is a branch of law that deals with matters relating to building construction, engineering and related fields. It is in essence an amalgam of contract law, commercial law, planning law, employment law and tort. Construction law covers a wide range of legal issues including contract, negligence, bonds and bonding, guarantees and sureties, liens and other security interests, tendering, construction claims, and related consultancy contracts. Construction law affects many participants in the construction industry, including financial institutions, surveyors, architects, builders, engineers, construction workers, and planners.

                Robert E. Landry and I held secondary positions in representing a defendant at a recent trial that lasted 8 days.  I was impressed with his legal knowledge, grasp of the issues, and presentations (written and oral) to the court.  It is rare that I have the opportunity to rate a lawyer as highly as I have rated Mr. Landry.

Robert has extensive experience with claims arising in the chemical, petrochemical and refining industries. He has litigated toxic exposure claims, serious industrial personal injury claims (e.g., spinal cord injuries resulting in paralysis, inhalation injuries requiring lung transplants, and severe burn injuries), industrial construction claims and environmental claims, many of which involved complex chemical, petrochemical, and refinery processes. This experience has given Robert valuable insight into the construction and operation of petrochemical plants and refineries. He also has litigated a variety of commercial claims arising in the industrial and petrochemical setting.Robert also has represented physicians, accountants and other professionals in a variety of claims relating to their specific practices.Robert also has successfully defended numerous labor law matters, including claims of wrongful termination, sexual harassment and discrimination, racial discrimination, age discrimination and violations of the Equal Pay Act and Family and Medical Leave Act. In fact, a summary judgment victory secured by Robert became the first Family and Medical Leave Act case heard by a federal appellate court. See Manuel v. Westlake Polymers Corp., No. 94-0691, 1994 WL 809934 (W.D. La.) 66 F. 3d 758 (5th Cir. 1995).In addition to his litigation practice, Robert also is a certified mediator, having received his training from the Straus Institute for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine University School of Law.Representative ExperienceRepresented Rimkus Consulting Group in an action for damages brought by Shelter Mutual Insurance Company.  We urged an exception to venue as the result of Shelter’s failure to sue Rimkus in the parties’ contractually agreed forum.  Although our venue exception initially was denied by the trial court, we took a supervisory writ to the appellate court and then to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which granted our writ to resolve the jurisprudential split on this issue among the Louisiana appellate courts.  After extensive briefing and oral argument, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Rimkus, upholding the validity of the pre-litigation contractual venue selection clause. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rimkus Consulting Grp., Inc. of Louisiana, 2013-1977 (La. 7/1/14), reh'g denied (Aug. 25, 2014)Successfully defended styrene manufacturer in $20 million breach of contract claim, obtaining not only a defense (zero) jury verdict on the contract claim but securing a jury verdict in excess of $16 million on client’s breach of fiduciary duty counterclaimRepresented CITGO Petroleum in a multimillion dollar contractual claim brought against it by a former scaffolding contractor.  After conducting extensive written discovery, we were able to take three depositions that provided the basis for a significant counterclaim.  After asserting the counterclaim, the scaffolding contractor agreed to dismiss its claims with prejudice.Safway Services.

information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

Job Details
               GO Boston Shuttle has been serving Central Massachusetts, Metro West, the South Shore, Newton/Waltham and Boston areas successfully for over 20 years. Rob Landry graduated from Bentley College in 1994 and assumed full-time responsibility for management of Ultimate Parking Services in Boston, before co-founding Ultimate Livery, Inc. in 1999. Rob has served as president of this Boston-based limousine service since its inception, and grown the business rapidly through development of a balanced customer base of leading area businesses, hotels, educational institutions and individual clients. In 2001 he bought his partners out and assumed full control of the company. And in 2006 he started Boston Shuttle Services, Inc., and addressed the growing demand for more cost effective transportation services. GO Boston Shuttle Corporation has continued to strengthen the quality of its round the clock services and operating model, and has benefited considerably from the synergies between the Livery and Shuttle businesses. The company has made increasing use of technology through investment in web reservation and flight tracking systems, email confirmations and the placement of GPS and 2-way communication devices in each of its vehicles. These investments and a set of well defined operating procedures and training measures have enabled the company to compete on the basis of prompt, reliable and courteous service at a reasonable price. Today GO Boston Shuttle Corporation has a growing fleet of sedans, SUV's, limos, vans and buses and has a staff of over 75 full and part time people serving a large account base comprised of 80% corporate and 20% individual clients. GO Boston Shuttle Corporation is licensed by the DTE, MassPort and the MassPike Authorities and provides regular service to and from downtown Boston hotels, corporate accounts and Logan Airport. GO Boston Shuttle has a well-trained and seasoned staff of professional, uniformed drivers, which has experienced very low turnover. Each of these drivers has signed customer confidentiality agreements, is CORI certified, drug tested - and continuously evaluated on their ability to meet the highest standards of customer service and driving courtesy.
