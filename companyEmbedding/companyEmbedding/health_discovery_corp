Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Fractal Genomic Modeling (FGM)
Independant Validations











Since their introduction in 1992, Support Vector Machines marked a breakthrough in the theory of learning systems.  Rooted in the Statistical Learning Theory developed by Vladimir Vapnik, Support Vector Machines quickly gained attention from the pattern recognition community due to its theoretical and computational merits.

													Statistical Learning Theory, the backbone of Support Vector Machines, provides a new framework for modeling learning algorithms, merges the fields of machine learning and statistics, and inspires algorithms that overcome all of the above difficulties. A new generation of learning algorithms - or equivalently of statistical methods - has recently been developed, based on this theory.
Health Discovery Corporation's SVM technology outperforms even advanced statistical modeling methodologies such as neural networks.  Neural networks suffer from a limited ability to handle data and can only analyze the data from two or three dimensions.  Support Vector Machines, however, are able to process infinite amounts of data and to analyze the data to find separations and delineations high dimensionality.

												The Company’s SVM technology is commonly considered within the context of artificial intelligence.  This is a branch of computer science concerned with giving computers the ability to perform functions normally associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning and optimization through experience. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables the development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn.  Pattern recognition is machine learning with a wide spectrum of applications including medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, classifying DNA sequences, detecting credit card fraud, stock market analysis, object recognition in computer vision, and robot locomotion.








Pattern Recognition in 
																One-Dimensional Space








Pattern Recognition in 
																Two-Dimensional Space








Pattern Recognition in 
																Three-Dimensional Space
Data separations can become simpler in higher dimensional space.

While separable only by a highly nonlinear function in 2D, a simple plane provides this 3D separation in our example.

	On January 23, 2017, Health
	Discovery Corporation (the “Company” or “HDC”) notified NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc. (“NeoGenomics”)
	of HDC’s election to terminate all licenses that are subject to the Master License Agreement (the “MLA”) dated
	January 6, 2012, between the Company and NeoGenomics. The MLA was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
	on January 11, 2012 as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.


	 


	The MLA provides for termination
	of the licenses by HDC upon a material breach by NeoGenomics and HDC is hereby exercising those rights. The Company believes, among
	other things, that NeoGenomics failed to use best efforts as defined in Section 2.3 of the MLA during the Development Term of the
	MLA. The termination by HDC does not trigger any early termination penalties for HDC.


	 


	Accordingly, NeoGenomics
	has been directed to cease and desist all uses of the Licensed Products. Additionally, pursuant to the MLA, upon termination, NeoGenomics
	may not use any product or service based upon the Licensed Technology without infringing upon HDC’s technology.


	 


	Furthermore, NeoGenomics
	has been notified that any patents, issued or pending, owned by either HDC or NeoGenomics which are based in whole or in part on
	HDC’s patents or technology may not be used by NeoGenomics in the absence of a license authorized by HDC.


	 


	Since the Effective Date
	of the MLA, HDC has worked diligently and was fully supportive to what HDC was led to believe would be a successful commercial
	launch of Licensed Products by NeoGenomics. NeoGenomics has failed to cure several defaults of their obligations required per the
	MLA including, but not limited to, reporting related to Licensed Uses along with their corresponding payments. Despite HDC’s
	numerous prior requests regarding NeoGenomics’ usage of HDC’s technology and NeoGenomics failure to provide the usage
	reports, HDC has now demanded a full report and compensation for all uses of HDC’s technology as called for in the MLA. HDC
	will pursue all compensation due from NeoGenomics to the full extent of the law. Additionally, HDC is evaluating potential damages
	related to the failure of NeoGenomics to perform its obligations per the MLA.

	notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.27.


	 


	The foregoing description
	of the termination notice does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such document, a copy

	Mr. VanOort:


	 


	Health Discovery Corporation (“HDC”)
	has previously requested a complete statement of any and all uses of any kind of HDC technology by NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc.
	(“NEO”) as required by the Master License Agreement (“MLA”) dated January 6, 2012. The MLA includes a provision
	(Section 3.7) for NEO to provide such reporting on a timely and complete basis. To date, NEO has ignored this requirement and several
	requests by HDC for the required information as called for in the MLA. HDC repeats its demand for such a statement and accounting
	for any and all uses of HDC technology by NEO within 4 business days.


	 


	In the absence of NEO providing this information,
	HDC has prepared an invoice, which is enclosed. This invoice is based on HDC’s good faith analysis of information it believes
	to be accurate for amounts currently owed to HDC as compensation for the revenue received for the use of HDC’s technology
	by NEO to date. HDC hereby demands immediate payment of $2,280,000. The invoice is based on amounts owed as far back as April 2016
	so these amounts owed are well beyond past due. Additionally, as further details are discovered, HDC reserves the right to increase
	the amount of this invoice.


	 


	It should also be noted that on January 9,
	2017, HDC requested information pertaining to NEO’s assertion that NEO had a First Commercial Use (“Commercial Use”)
	of a Flow Cytometry Interpretation System based product or service. Because NEO did not provide the information requested, HDC
	hereby rejects NEO’s claim of Commercial Use.


	 


	We remind you of HDC’s notice to NEO
	dated October 3, 2016 in which HDC elected its right to cancel all licenses that are the subject of the MLA. HDC subsequently delayed
	the effectiveness of the October 3, 2016 letter. The purpose of the delay was to allow for a discussion between the parties to
	find alternative remedies for HDC. After the passage of over one hundred days and one formal meeting in New York without any resolution,
	HDC’s board has determined that the best interest of its shareholders is to take the following action. Therefore, you are
	advised that HDC hereby declares its letter of October 3, 2016 effective immediately. Accordingly, HDC exercises its right pursuant
	to Section 8.3 in the agreement to terminate all of the licenses that are the subject of the MLA.


	 






	 


	 







	 




	 


	As stated in our October 3, 2016 letter, the
	principal basis for the termination of the licenses is NEO’s failure to perform its obligations as set forth in Section 2.3.
	Specifically, NEO agreed to use its best efforts to develop the Initial Licensed Products and have a First Commercial Use of such
	licensed products within the Development Term. The Development Term commenced on January 6, 2012 and ended on January 7, 2014.
	Since the Development Term ended on January 7, 2014, there is no cure period.


	 


	The facts cited in the fourth paragraph of
	the October 3, 2016 letter remain accurate but there have been subsequent developments that are very concerning to HDC.


	 


	During an October 26, 2016 earnings conference
	call with investors and investment analysts, Mr. Steve Jones made detrimental and revealing statements concerning HDC. Mr. Jones
	stated that NEO intends to commercialize a prostate test but that NEO alleges the test is not based on HDC technology. HDC asserts
	that this statement is untrue. In fact, NEO’s publications related to the test, NeoLAB Prostate, clearly indicate the use
	of HDC’s know-how and technology including, but not limited to, the four genes that are a part of a pending patent with the
	United States Patent and Trademark Office. These same genes are part of a patent issued in Europe, which does not expire until
	December 2029. Therefore, NEO’s statements on October 26, 2016 are untrue and possibly deceptive. In addition, the statement
	was clearly damaging to HDC and its shareholders. The statement was injurious to the public reputation of HDC and its technology.


	 


	Equally concerning, however, is that the statement
	is an admission by NEO that it not only confirms it failed to fulfill its best efforts obligation to HDC but that NEO has actually
	been undertaking to surreptitiously develop a product which would directly compete with an HDC based product for some currently
	unknown period of time. Through numerous public statements over the years, NEO led HDC and its shareholders to believe that it
	was using its best efforts to develop and commercialize a prostate test based upon HDC technology as it had agreed to do. In fact,
	it was doing no such thing and it was secretly developing a competitive product. Mr. VanOort also noted this unsettling development
	during a conference call with HDC on October 5, 2016. You stated that NEO was not using HDC technology in its prostate test and
	that NEO, therefore, had no obligation to pay any milestone and royalties to HDC. You admitted that HDC had “pointed us in
	the right direction” and that NEO would consider paying a greatly reduced compensation on the condition that HDC agree to
	accept a renegotiation of the MLA on terms and conditions materially adverse to HDC.


	 


	It is clear that HDC and its shareholders have
	been damaged by the actions, inactions and false statements made by NEO. HDC is evaluating such damages and intends to seek professional
	advice as to the nature and extent of such damages and appropriate actions that HDC should take in order to protect its shareholders.


	 


	To date, HDC’s analysis of such damages
	includes, but is not limited to, the following:


	 






	1)


	Damages sustained as a result of NEO’s failure to use its best efforts to develop and commercialize
	HDC technology in the agreed upon time frame.




	 






	2)


	NEO’s failure as above precluded HDC from the opportunity to contract with other parties
	to develop and commercialize HDC’s technology thereby foregoing substantial value that would have accrued from timely development
	of a product or service based on HDC technology.




	 






	3)


	Damage to HDC’s reputation for its technology, which may impair HDCs ability to find other
	development partners for its technology.




	 






	4)


	Damage sustained by HDC’s past and current shareholders.




	 






	 


	 







	 




	 


	HDC hereby demands that NEO immediately cease
	and desist from the use of any HDC technology in any way, including but not limited to, any use or sale of any product / service
	or combination product / service which is based on or uses any HDC technology or intellectual property.


	 


	Finally, please be notified that any patents
	that NEO has or will apply for as well as any patents that are issued which are based in whole or in part on HDC’s patents
	may not be used in the absence of a license agreement between NEO and HDC.


	 


	If you have any questions please call either
	of the HDC representatives listed in the January 9, 2017 letter to NEO.


	 


	Sincerely,


	 


	/s/ Board of Directors


	Health Discovery Corporation


	 


	Enclosure

	Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP
