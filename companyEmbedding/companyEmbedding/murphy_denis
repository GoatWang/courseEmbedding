Denis Murphy was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1935.  Having no formal art training, he began working in 1950 as an illustrator and cartoonist. 
After spending a few years in Zambia, he was drawn into wildlife art, travelling to Swaziland and Kenya.
He was also known for his work in philately in Southern Africa. This resulted in commissions for South Africa, Namibia, Transkei and Ciskei, winning awards for ‘Best Stamp of the Year’ as well as ‘Artist of the Year’.
His exhibitions included The Explorers Club, NY, The Everard Read Gallery, Johannesburg and The Mount Kenya Art Galleries at the Mount Kenya Safari Club in Nanyuki, Kenya.
Between 1985 and 1991, he was commissioned by early wildlife conservationists in Kenya, Don and Iris Hunt, to paint Ahmed and his askaris and a set of 5 vanishing species to include the Gerenuk.  All prints from these originals were made in limited editions, signed and numbered by the artist.
His work contributed to the conservation causes of The Mt. Kenya Animal Orphanage at the Mt. Kenya Safari Club in Nanyuki, Kenya and the Centre for the Rehabilitation of Wildlife amongst others.
He passed away in June 2012 at the age of 77.

EUGENE, OR - John Murphy, CEO and co-owner of Murphy Co., a manufacturer of hardwood plywood and other wood products, field a lawsuit against three relatives alleging that they are breaking the terms of a 2001 buy/sell agreement.The lawsuit, filed Sept. 21, against Peter Murphy Jr., 76; Dennis Murphy, 74; and Edward Murphy 74, contends that the trio has attempted to sell shares and possibly the entire company. According to the Register Guard, none of the three men is active in the day-to-day operations of the company. Peter Murphy reportedly ran the company from 1974 to 1996 and Dennis Murphy worked for the company in the mid-1970s.
The Register Guard reported that the lawsuit seeks to stop Peter Murphy from selling his stock to Dennis and Edward and to stop all three from selling their shares or the entire company. The newspaper noted that John, Peter and Dennis Murphy each own 28.5 of the company's shares and Edward Murphy, who never worked at the company, owns 14.3 percent.
While the terms of the amended buy/sell agreement allow one of the owners to sell his shares upon reaching the age of 76, it also stipulates that the qualifying owner must first offer his shares to the company.
Murphy Plywood was founded more than 100 years ago. The company announced in January that it would construct three buildings totaling approximately 60,000  square feet at its plywood mill in Rogue River, OR. According to the Mail Tribune Murphy had purchased the dormant 164,000-square-foot plant formerly operated by Panel  Processing of Milwaukie, OR, for $3.6 million in February 2010 and reopened it  in December 2010. The plant employs approximately 130 people.
Murphy also operates plants in White City and Elma, WA; plus Sutherin and Eugene, OR.

In his youth Maurice Murphy learned the cornet and was a member of various brass bands including Henton Colliery and Crookhall Colliery Bands, the Yorkshire Engineering and Welding Company Band, and the Fairey Aviation Band, Stockport, during which time he worked as an electrician.In 1956 he became solo cornet with the world famous Black Dyke Mills Band where he played until 1961. At this time he played the trumpet with the Hallé Orchestra and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and he became the principal trumpet of the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra (now called the BBC Philharmonic) in 1961, a post he held until 1976. He also taught at the Royal Northern College of Music from 1974 to 1977.His career reached its height during his thirty-year tenure as Principal Trumpet of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), where for the years 1977 – 1986 he sat next to Principal Trombone Denis Wick. As well playing all the orchestral repertoire for the finest conductors in the world Maurice also featured on many film soundtracks including all six Star Wars films. Star Wars was his first job after being given Principal Trumpet chair in the LSO and Maurice’s unmistakable sound helped cement the relationship between composer John Williams and the LSO. John Williams describes the “amazing, electrifying moment” when he first heard Maurice and the LSO brass launch into the opening bars of Star Wars, the sound that created “the voice of a hero”.Maurice’s heroic sound became part of film history, and he went on to record the soundtracks for the Harry Potter films, Superman: The Movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gangs of New York, Johnny English, Reign of Fire, a solo in Mr. Holland’s Opus, Philadelphia, Batman, the Alien movies, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Gladiator, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, We Were Soldiers, some of the James Bond movies, and many more.In 2008 Maurice received the Honorary Award of the International Trumpet Guild at the 2008 ITG Conference in Banff, given to those “who have made extraordinary contributions to the art of trumpet playing” He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours.Maurice Murphy died on 28 October 2010, aged 75. +1 Tweet Share Share PinShares 0Back to the Artists Main Page >>Find a product  Search for:   Product Categories Select a categoryAccessories   Adaptors   Boosters & Tone Collars   Brushes   Cleaning Cloths   Mouthpiece pouches      Large brass      Small brass   Mute bags   Mute corks   Tuners   Valve OilMouthpieces   Baritone   Cornet   Euphonium   Flugelhorn   French Horn   Tenor Horn   Trombone   Trumpet   TubaMutes   Baritone   Euphonium   Flugelhorn   French Horn   Tenor Horn   Trombone      Alto Trombone      Bass Trombone      Tenor Trombone   Trumpet & Cornet      B♭ Trumpet & Cornet      D or E♭ Trumpet & Soprano Cornet      Piccolo Trumpet   Tuba  Latest Products   Wooden Straight Mute for BB♭ Tuba      Flexible ‘Snake’ Brush for French Horn      Mouthpiece Brush (large)      Mouthpiece Brush (small)      Steven Mead Baritone Mouthpiece - Gold Plated    Featured Artist Terry HsiehThe US trombonist bringing jazz and funk to China

He has tried cases and been lead counsel in state and federal courts throughout the country. Dennis has defended class actions, claims by individuals for personal injury, and has coordinated complex litigation.
Recently, Dennis was lead trial lawyer for Zimmer, Inc. and related entities in a series of cases arising from Zimmer's acquisition of competitive distributors. This multijurisdictional litigation was successfully resolved after a three-week jury trial of the first case in state court in Louisville, Kentucky.

Reynolds to a unanimous defense verdict in federal court in Washington. He is currently lead counsel in cases proceeding to trial against Reynolds in multiple jurisdictions in Florida. He also has defended The Sherwin-Williams Company in public nuisance cases brought against the lead pigment industry by several Ohio cities.

Profile





Experience








Dennis Murphy is a trial lawyer who litigates product liability, commercial, antitrust, and employment cases. He has tried cases and been lead counsel in state and federal courts throughout the country. Dennis has defended class actions, claims by individuals for personal injury, and has coordinated complex litigation.
Recently, Dennis was lead trial lawyer for Zimmer, Inc. and related entities in a series of cases arising from Zimmer's acquisition of competitive distributors. This multijurisdictional litigation was successfully resolved after a three-week jury trial of the first case in state court in Louisville, Kentucky. Dennis also has represented Zimmer in antitrust litigation and was recently successful in arguing a motion to dismiss on behalf of the orthopedic implant industry in an antitrust action filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania. In addition, Dennis has obtained a number of injunctions for Zimmer enforcing noncompete and similar obligations.
Dennis also represents the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in smoking and health litigation. In 2006 he helped try a $10 million damages case against R.J. Reynolds to a unanimous defense verdict in federal court in Washington. He is currently lead counsel in cases proceeding to trial against Reynolds in multiple jurisdictions in Florida. He also has defended The Sherwin-Williams Company in public nuisance cases brought against the lead pigment industry by several Ohio cities.
Dennis serves on Jones Day's Firmwide Lawyer Training Committee and regularly conducts training seminars on trial practice. He is an author of the Ohio chapter in Tort Law Desk Reference — A Fifty State Compendium (Aspen).

Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours?

fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case?

What Makes Dennis Deliberately Different
Dennis believes that history can repeat itself. That’s why this history buff knows how to use case precedent while simultaneously applying creative solutions to his clients’ advantage in obtaining favorable outcomes.



Overview
Overview
Experience
Credentials



Dennis  “D.J.” Murphy is an associate attorney in Sedgwick’s San Francisco office, where he is a member of the Complex Litigation Division. Dennis focuses his practice on antitrust and unfair competition, product liability, and consumer product class actions, including successfully defending clients through the class certification stage of litigation against California Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law claims.
Dennis also handles all issues related to California’s Proposition 65. He represents a variety of retail, consumer product, and food manufacturing clients, where he has favorably settled numerous cases and has successfully litigated other matters through trial. He further advises clients on how to comply with the complex regulations to avoid subsequent suits.
Prior to joining the firm, Dennis was a Sedgwick summer associate and a judicial extern with the Honorable A. James Robertson, II of San Francisco Superior Court.
While in law school, Dennis was an articles editor for the UC Davis Law Review, a research editor for the UC Davis Journal of International Law and Policy, and a board member of the Entertainment and Sports Law Society. He also competed in the national Cyber Crimes Moot Court competition representing UC Davis.
As an undergraduate, Dennis appeared on the Dean’s List First Honors every semester. He was published in the undergraduate research journal for his article on the success of American third party political groups leading up to the Civil War. Dennis also served as the executive producer of his undergraduate school’s student-run television network, BCTV, and worked with the undergraduate admissions office as a tour guide.
 
 


Representative Matters

Obtained complete defense verdict and sat third chair for two-week trial where the plaintiff sought more than a billion dollars in civil penalties for alleged violations of state chemical warning statute against product manufacturer client.
Secured dismissal of contempt charge against retail client for alleged violations of prior court-approved consent judgment.
Prepared multiple successful motions to seal automotive client’s trade secret, warranty data, and other confidential business information where the plaintiffs argued for public disclosure of the material.
Negotiated a withdrawal of the plaintiff’s pre-suit notice of violation letter where product manufacturer and retail store clients were exempt under state statute.
