            Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 to manufacture and market foil resistors. Vishay began operations with foil resistors and strain gages as its initial product offerings. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in PhotoStress products, strain gages, and foil resistors. In 1985, having grown from a start-up into the world's leading manufacturer of these original products, Vishay began an ongoing series of strategic acquisitions to become a broad-line manufacturer of electronic components that provides one-stop shop service to customers. Vishay has become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components. Technological innovation has always been a key part of Vishay's identity. Company acquisitions include Siliconix, Telefunken, General Semiconductor, Dale, Draloric, Sprague, Vitramon and BCcomponents. Vishay Intertechnology is headquartered in Malvern, Pa.

1 A and 2 A Devices Feature Low 0.65 mm Profile and Forward Voltage Drop Down to 0.36 V

MALVERN, Pa., July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH) today expanded its offering of surface-mount TMBS® Trench MOS Barrier Schottky rectifiers with 10 new 1 A and 2 A devices in the eSMP® series MicroSMP (DO-219AD) package. Providing space-saving alternatives to Schottky rectifiers in the SOD123W, the Vishay General Semiconductor devices feature reverse voltages from 45 V to 150 V and include the industry's first 2 A TMBS rectifiers in the MicroSMP to deliver forward voltage as low as 0.40 V.
Currently, Schottky rectifiers with current ratings to 2 A are typically available in the SOD123W and SMA packages. The devices released today increase power density by offering this high forward current in the smaller MicroSMP. Measuring 2.5 mm by 1.3 mm with a low 0.65 mm profile, the package is 35 % thinner than the SOD123W while occupying 45 % less board space. For excellent thermal performance, the MicroSMP features an asymmetric leadframe design.
With their forward voltage drop down to 0.36 V for 1 A devices and 0.40 V for 2 A devices, the rectifiers reduce power loss and improve efficiency in low voltage, high frequency inverters, DC/DC converters, and freewheeling and polarity protection diodes for commercial and industrial applications. The devices are also available in an AEC-Q101 qualified version for automotive applications.
The new rectifiers feature a maximum operating junction temperature up to +175 °C and an MSL moisture sensitivity level of 1, per J-STD-020, LF maximum peak of +260 °C. Ideal for automated placement, the devices are RoHS-compliant and halogen-free.

MALVERN, Pa. - July 24, 2017 - Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE: VSH) today announced a new 36 W Power Metal Strip battery shunt resistor featuring three sense pins in the 8518 case size. With extremely low resistance values down to 50 µΩ, the Vishay Dale WSBS8518...40 increases accuracy and lowers costs compared with Hall Effect current sensing solutions, while its sense pins assist in PCB mounting, provide consistent contact point location, and offer a connection to ground via the third sense pin.
      

        The three sense pin device released today features a proprietary processing technique that produces extremely low resistance values of 50 µΩ, 100 µΩ, and 125 µΩ. These low values allow for more accurate data to determine battery charge and discharge, thus helping designers meet specific customer battery management requirements for applications in gas, diesel, hybrid, and electric cars and trucks, as well as electric forklifts, UPS systems, and other heavy industrial applications.
      

        The WSBS8518...40 features a solid metal manganese-copper alloy resistive element with low TCR (± 20 ppm/°C) and a welded terminal to element connection that allows for up to 848 A of continuous current (value dependent). The resistor offers low inductance values of Vishay Green.
      

        Samples and production quantities of the WSBS8518...40 are available now, with a lead time of 10 to 12 weeks for larger orders.

History[edit]
Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 by Dr. Felix Zandman. The Company was named after Dr. Zandman’s ancestral village in Lithuania, Veisiejai. It began operations with a patented technology that had two product lines: foil resistors and foil resistance strain gauges. In 1985, having grown from a start-up into the world's leading manufacturer of these original products, the company began an ongoing series of acquisitions to become a broadline manufacturer of electronics components.[2]
Having expanded into so many product lines, Vishay announced in October 2009 that it would be creating a spin-off company which focuses on their high precision technologies in Foil Technology. Vishay Precision Group represents approximately 9% of Vishay annual revenue, and included their product lines in Bulk Metal Foil Resistors, micro-measurements, load cells, process weighing, and on-board weighing.[3][4] In July 2010, Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group (VPG).
Since 1985, Vishay has pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements: expanding within the electronic components industry, primarily through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components; reducing expenses; transferring manufacturing operations to countries with lower labor costs and government-sponsored incentives; maintaining significant production facilities in regions where Vishay markets the bulk of its products; continually rolling out new products; and strengthening relationships with customers and strategic partners. As a result of this strategy, Vishay has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world’s largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.[5]
Some of the manufacturers that Vishay has acquired include HiRel Systems (2012), the resistor business of Huntington Electric (2011), the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET (2008), the PCS business of International Rectifier (2007), BCcomponents and Beyschlag (2002), General Semiconductor, the infrared components business of Infineon, Mallory (NACC), and Tansitor (2001), Cera-Mite, Electro-Films, and Spectrol (2000), Siliconix and Telefunken (1998), Vitramon (1994), Roederstein (1993), Sprague (1992), Sfernice (1988), Draloric (1987), and Dale (1985).[6]
The former Spectrol Reliance factory in Swindon, England, (UK arm of Spectrol Electronics that was acquired by Vishay in 2000, originally known as Reliance Controls) was the last design by Team 4 (Richard Rogers, Norman Foster and their respective wives), and is considered the first example of High-tech architecture in the United Kingdom. It opened in 1967 and was demolished in 1991, Spectrol Reliance moving to a different part of Swindon.[7]

History[edit]
Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 by Dr. Felix Zandman. The Company was named after Dr. Zandman’s ancestral village in Lithuania, Veisiejai. It began operations with a patented technology that had two product lines: foil resistors and foil resistance strain gauges. In 1985, having grown from a start-up into the world's leading manufacturer of these original products, the company began an ongoing series of acquisitions to become a broadline manufacturer of electronics components.[2]
Having expanded into so many product lines, Vishay announced in October 2009 that it would be creating a spin-off company which focuses on their high precision technologies in Foil Technology. Vishay Precision Group represents approximately 9% of Vishay annual revenue, and included their product lines in Bulk Metal Foil Resistors, micro-measurements, load cells, process weighing, and on-board weighing.[3][4] In July 2010, Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group (VPG).
Since 1985, Vishay has pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements: expanding within the electronic components industry, primarily through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components; reducing expenses; transferring manufacturing operations to countries with lower labor costs and government-sponsored incentives; maintaining significant production facilities in regions where Vishay markets the bulk of its products; continually rolling out new products; and strengthening relationships with customers and strategic partners. As a result of this strategy, Vishay has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world’s largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.[5]
Some of the manufacturers that Vishay has acquired include HiRel Systems (2012), the resistor business of Huntington Electric (2011), the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET (2008), the PCS business of International Rectifier (2007), BCcomponents and Beyschlag (2002), General Semiconductor, the infrared components business of Infineon, Mallory (NACC), and Tansitor (2001), Cera-Mite, Electro-Films, and Spectrol (2000), Siliconix and Telefunken (1998), Vitramon (1994), Roederstein (1993), Sprague (1992), Sfernice (1988), Draloric (1987), and Dale (1985).[6]
The former Spectrol Reliance factory in Swindon, England, (UK arm of Spectrol Electronics that was acquired by Vishay in 2000, originally known as Reliance Controls) was the last design by Team 4 (Richard Rogers, Norman Foster and their respective wives), and is considered the first example of High-tech architecture in the United Kingdom. It opened in 1967 and was demolished in 1991, Spectrol Reliance moving to a different part of Swindon.[7]

History[edit]
Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 by Dr. Felix Zandman. The Company was named after Dr. Zandman’s ancestral village in Lithuania, Veisiejai. It began operations with a patented technology that had two product lines: foil resistors and foil resistance strain gauges. In 1985, having grown from a start-up into the world's leading manufacturer of these original products, the company began an ongoing series of acquisitions to become a broadline manufacturer of electronics components.[2]
Having expanded into so many product lines, Vishay announced in October 2009 that it would be creating a spin-off company which focuses on their high precision technologies in Foil Technology. Vishay Precision Group represents approximately 9% of Vishay annual revenue, and included their product lines in Bulk Metal Foil Resistors, micro-measurements, load cells, process weighing, and on-board weighing.[3][4] In July 2010, Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group (VPG).
Since 1985, Vishay has pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements: expanding within the electronic components industry, primarily through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components; reducing expenses; transferring manufacturing operations to countries with lower labor costs and government-sponsored incentives; maintaining significant production facilities in regions where Vishay markets the bulk of its products; continually rolling out new products; and strengthening relationships with customers and strategic partners. As a result of this strategy, Vishay has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world’s largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.[5]
Some of the manufacturers that Vishay has acquired include HiRel Systems (2012), the resistor business of Huntington Electric (2011), the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET (2008), the PCS business of International Rectifier (2007), BCcomponents and Beyschlag (2002), General Semiconductor, the infrared components business of Infineon, Mallory (NACC), and Tansitor (2001), Cera-Mite, Electro-Films, and Spectrol (2000), Siliconix and Telefunken (1998), Vitramon (1994), Roederstein (1993), Sprague (1992), Sfernice (1988), Draloric (1987), and Dale (1985).[6]
The former Spectrol Reliance factory in Swindon, England, (UK arm of Spectrol Electronics that was acquired by Vishay in 2000, originally known as Reliance Controls) was the last design by Team 4 (Richard Rogers, Norman Foster and their respective wives), and is considered the first example of High-tech architecture in the United Kingdom. It opened in 1967 and was demolished in 1991, Spectrol Reliance moving to a different part of Swindon.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
