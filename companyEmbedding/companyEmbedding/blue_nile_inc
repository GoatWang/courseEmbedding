History[edit]
The company that became Blue Nile began in 1995 when Doug Williams of Williams & Son Inc. of Seattle started a website to sell diamonds online.[3] Mark C. Vadon, then a management consultant at Bain & Company, purchased a diamond engagement ring from the site in 1998.[3] In 1999, Vadon raised $6 million to purchase 85% of the company and improve the website.[3] The company’s name was changed to Blue Nile in November 1999.[4] During the next year, the company raised an additional $44 million.[3] Investors included Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[4] Blue Nile raised $76 million in its IPO on May 18, 2004. Merrill Lynch & Co., Bear Stearns Cos. and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC managed the IPO, sharing fees of $5.4 million.[4] The initial public offering of shares in Blue Nile Inc, rose 39% in first-day trading, closing at $28.40.
Although the company had $44 million in revenue in 2000, it lost $30 million because it spent $40 million in television advertising.[3] Its investors contributed an additional $7 million in 2001.[3] In 2006, Blue Nile sold $197 million in engagement rings and wedding bands, compared to $186 million for Tiffany & Co.[5]
On Nov, 8, 2011, CEO Diane Irvine, who had been with the company for 12 years and its CEO since 2008, abruptly resigned.[6] Irvine was replaced on an interim basis by senior vice president and general manager of international Vijay Talwar.[7] In March 2012, Harvey Kanter, former CEO of MooseJaw, was named the new CEO.[8]
In 2015, Blue Nile reported net sales of US$473 million and net income of US$9.7 million.[1] Blue Nile promotes itself as a supplier of ethically sourced diamonds and endorses a zero-tolerance policy towards conflict diamonds.[9]
In the summer of 2015, Blue Nile opened their first webroom at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, N.Y., the company plans to open three more webrooms in 2016 at The Westchester mall in White Plains, N.Y., at Tysons Corner Center mall in Fairfax County, Va., and at Washington Square mall outside of Portland.[10]
Blue Nile was designated a Bizrate Circle of Excellence Award winner in 2016.[11]
In June 2017, former Chief Digital Officer of Target, Jason Goldberger, was appointed Blue Nile's CEO. Goldberger also spent time at Gilt Groupe, Hayneedle and Amazon.[12]
Acquisition[edit]
Bain Capital Private Equity and Bow Street LLC acquired Blue Nile, on February 17, 2017, for $40.75 per share (approximately $500 million).[13] First announced on November 7, 2016, shares of Blue Nile Inc. jumped 34%.[14] The transaction was approved by company shareholders on February 2, 2017. Trading in Blue Nile’s common stock on NASDAQ ended February 21.[15]

  Product Warranty




Lifetime Manufacturer Warranty

We stand behind our products and warrant that all items will be free from manufacturing defects for the life of the products.  If you believe your item has a manufacturing defect, you may return it to us for inspection.  If we determine your merchandise is damaged due to a manufacturing defect, we will repair the merchandise or, if we deem appropriate, replace the item.  If the item is no longer available, Blue Nile may, in its discretion, replace with like-kind or allow a refund equal to the selling price of the original item or component. If we determine that the damage is not caused by a manufacturing defect, then we will notify you and let you know if repair services are available at cost or otherwise. Please note that slight irregularities and variations in craftsmanship or natural characteristics, or internal inclusions, visible or otherwise, in colored gemstones are unique and individual to each item.  These characteristics are considered as part of the character of the item, and should not be considered a defect.





Complimentary Cleaning and Inspection Services on Diamond Rings

We recommend having your diamond ring cleaned and inspected every six months or if it undergoes any potential trauma.  Inspections may help prevent the loss of a stone and extend the life of your jewelry.  This cleaning and inspection service is free of charge to Blue Nile customers on their Blue Nile diamond rings.  The customer only pays for shipping, and Blue Nile pays for return shipping.  Repairs to your ring mounting can also be done at this time at cost.





Conditions and Exclusions

The foregoing Manufacturer Warranty and Complimentary Services are available only to the person who purchased the covered product from Blue Nile. Maintenance, repair, sizing or other service performed by someone other than Blue Nile will void your Manufacturer Warranty. Fine jewelry is not impervious to normal wear, activities or trauma. This is particularly true for rings since hands are regularly subjected to considerable abuse.  We do not provide warranties for damage due to normal wear, product loss, loss of stones or theft. Damage or loss that results from failure to obtain repairs necessary to maintain the integrity of the product are also not covered. Some examples of common jewelry issues that would not be considered manufacturing defects include:

Discoloration due to exposure to chemicals, make-up, swimming pools, hot tubs or bathing.
Prongs and precious metals, in general, wear over time and may require “building up” or restoration work as normal wear.
Bent, caught or worn out prongs(s) allowing a stone to fall out or be lost due to normal wear or other damage.
Lost stone or a stone has fallen out due to chipping or breaking caused by normal wear or other damage.

Blue Nile Inc.
Blue Nile Inc. is one of the leading players of internet jewelry market. Since 1999, the company has been rapidly developing to become the leading online retailer of fine jewelry and certified diamonds. The company grew out of a simple idea and has been able to resolve the majority of issues consumers faced when choosing jewelry products. Mark Vadon, the founder of Blue Nile has combined simplicity of customer approaches with the sophistication of jewelry products. Now, with extensive business experience and promising future, Blue Nile Inc.

should be more than attentive to opportunities and threats, which characterize present day jewelry markets. Blue Nile Introduction Blue Nile Inc. is one of the leading players of internet jewelry market. Since 1999, the company has been rapidly developing to become the leading online retailer of fine jewelry and certified diamonds. The company grew out of a simple idea and has been able to resolve the majority of issues consumers faced when choosing jewelry products. Mark Vadon, the founder of Blue Nile has combined simplicity of customer approaches with the sophistication of jewelry products.
Now, with extensive business experience and promising future, Blue Nile Inc. should be more than attentive to opportunities and threats, which characterize present day jewelry markets. Well known is the story about Mark Vadon, the founder of Blue Nile Inc. – the story, which has become the key to the company’s market success. Back in the middle of the 1990s, Mark Vadon first faced a serious personal problem, trying to choose an engagement ring (Blue Nile, 2009b). He gave up traditional jewelry retailers and took an opportunity to surf the net, trying to find the most relevant and the most effective product solution.
What Vadon found as a result of his detailed Internet analysis has later become the basis for his new company; and beyond being able to purchase the ring for an excellent price he has realized the unlimited potential, which online jewelry markets carried. The Internet Diamonds portal was the tool of Vadon’s business success. By the end of the 1990s, Vadon has gathered $6 million in funds and was willing to purchase Internet Diamonds with the aim to transform it into a new user-friendly internet business (Funding Universe, 2008).
In May 1999, he renamed Internet Diamonds into “Blue Nile”, which was followed by massive print and television advertising campaign (Funding Universe, 2008). By using television and print media, Blue Nile was actually shaping the new layer of customers, who would not be afraid of making expensive purchases online and would seek easy and cost-effective purchasing solutions. At the beginning of the new millennium, when dozens of companies were fighting to preserve their online market niches, Blue Nile Inc.
was still flourishing, being able to follow the increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, and expanding the range of jewelry products “to attract customers who would not spend thousands for jewelry” (Funding Universe, 2008). The items which were considered irrelevant by conventional retailers attracted thousands of women to Blue Nile, turning the company into the leading online supplier of jewelry. Vadon has also realized the role, which education and knowledge could play in the development and expansion of his business.
He tried to combine customer education with advertising. That an educated customer would be more likely to make a purchase from Blue Nile, Vadon was confident; as a result, the subsection “Education” has become the essential feature of the Blue Nile’s website, offering extensive and comprehensive information about all major kinds of jewelry (Blue Nile, 2009a). Blue Nile was the first to explain complicated professional terms by using the language, which was understandable to common consumers, making them aware of the best features and peculiarities of Blue Nile’s products.
Now, Blue Nile Inc. is a well-established brand name, which consumers associate with high quality customer service, fast delivery and user-friendly interface. “Every order is shipped free, guaranteed and returnable within 30 days, so you can be sure you made the right decision” (Blue Nile, 2009a). Regardless the difficulties which the company faced on its way to excellence, and despite the growing popularity of online jewelry products, Blue Nile should not neglect the opportunities and threats, which currently characterize the online jewelry market.
In this context, a detailed SWOT analysis may help identify and address the major market complexities. Strengths Well-established brand name Well-developed selling strategy High quality customer service Broad range of jewelry products Weaknesses Low profit margins Low-cost approach to sales Opportunities Developing actual network of retail outlets The increasingly sophisticated consumer needs The growing range of jewelry products in the market Threats Economic crisis in the U. S. The growing market competition The growing number of jewelry retailers Cheaper counterfeit goods
It should be noted, that even under the pressure of the growing economic crisis, Blue Nile has succeeded to keep its market niche, to expand its presence in the online markets, and to expand the range of its products. However, the low-cost selling strategy to which Blue Nile adheres (“instead of trying to push our gross margins as high as possible, we sell as cheap as we possibly can” – Funding Universe, 2008) may not work to promote the company’s profitability in the long run: the company’s net sales for the fourth quarter 2008 have fallen to $85. 8 million as compared to $111.
9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 (Blue Nile, 2009b). Given the company’s well-established brand name, the availability of material and non-material resources, as well as the growing variety of jewelry goods in the market, Blue Nile can readily expand the range of its products to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer needs; and by expanding its network of actual retail outlets, the company will be able to target the customers, who prefer making real time purchases. Certainly, Blue Nile should not neglect the worsening economic situation in the U. S.
; moreover, the jewelry market has always been characterized by high counterfeit product risks. The growing number of competitors may also threaten Blue Nile’s market position: Ashford. com, Diamonds. com, Tiffany & Co. , and Zale Corporation are fighting to expand their shares of market and may challenge stable market position of Blue Nile (Funding Universe, 2008). Nevertheless, the company’s emphasis on knowledge and customer awareness, as well as its openness to new products and services will help Blue Nile cope with the growing market challenges and maintain cost-effectiveness of its business operations in long-term periods.
Conclusion Blue Nile was started as the natural desire to improve the level of customer satisfaction in online jewelry markets. With time, the company has turned into the leading online supplier of jewelry products. The company’s stability is threatened by the growing economic crisis and the constantly increasing market competition, but given a well-established brand name, reputation, customer loyalty, and the growing range of jewelry products, Blue Nile is likely to retain its market position in the long run.

These sheets are a beautiful color, have a quality appearance and  feel durable.  They were not as soft as I had expected but that should resolve with washings.

These towels 1) are super soft. 2) They have been washed several times and hold up nicely! No snags, No shrinking, No fading. And they are still soft and absorbent! Will recommend!

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Edison, NJ professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Edison, NJ portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Edison, NJ professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Edison

Planning a spa makeover for your bathroom? Creating a luxurious bath retreat can be as simple as buying some new bath linens, soft fluffy towels and bath accessories. Whether or not you have the budget for a brand-new tub, there is plenty you can do to refresh your bathroom visually and make it more functional. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of bedding & bath: Home Stagers, Kitchen & Bath Designers, Interior Designers & Decorators, Furniture & Accessories.One of the most common problems in bathrooms is lack of storage space. Buying a bathroom vanity at your local building supply store may be the answer, but for more challenging storage solutions, you’ll want to contact an Edison, NJ bedding and bath manufacturer or retailer that specializes in custom storage options and unique bathroom furniture and accessories.From heated towel bars to shower curtains, use the Houzz Professionals listings to find Edison, NJ bedding and bath retailers with budget-friendly bathware and modern bath accessories. Some bathroom remodelers specialize in affordable equipment like grab bars, safety tubs and showers and other bathroom accessories designed for those with different physical needs. Does your bathroom need converting or upgrading for special needs?Is it time to wake up your master bedroom with some new bed linens? Since that very first white sale in Philadelphia’s John Wanamaker and Co. department store in 1878, January has always been a good month to buy bed linens.

Overview Of Blue Nile Inc Marketing Essay
Published: 23rd March, 2015 Last Edited: 23rd March, 2015

This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers.
Generic strategies can be defined as fundamental approaches to strategic planning adopted by companies or organizations in any market or industry in an effort to improve its competitive performance (Porter, 2006). Blue Nile Inc. has adapted two fundamental generic strategies, which include focus strategy and differentiation strategy. Combining business model together with these strategies determines Blue Nile Inc.'s position in the jewelry market (Porter, 2006).
The company has adopted the differentiation strategy in that it has made an effort to develop as well as market unique products for different clientele segments (Porter, 2006). Further, being an online retailer of unique and rare diamonds and gemstones, Blue Nile Inc. offers shoppers useful information as concerns the different products and services they may desire. This is the best strategy the company can adopt since it has very few or in other cases, no competitors thus enjoying competitive advantages, managing to sustain expensive advertising campaigns (Ibid, 2006). On the other hand, focus strategy is whereby a company or organization concentrates its resources on expanding or attempting to enter in a narrow industry or market segment (Porter, 2006). Blue Nile Inc. has employed this form of strategy as it is aware of its segment and has products capable of satisfying its needs competitively. By going online, the company focuses on smaller, specific niche of clients as compared to focusing on segments across the entire market (Porter, 2006).
Financial and Strategic Performance Indicators
Performance indicators can be defined as a measure of an organization's or company's performance. These measures are used to assist the firm in defining and evaluating how successful it is as well as how much progress it is making towards its long term organizational objectives (Porter, 2006). To measure its financial and strategic performance, Blue Nile Inc. largely focuses on competitive pricing, efficient and economical supply chain as well as lean cost. This is favored by the fact that it has established a unique online approach and designed a website displaying the numerous distinct diamonds and gemstones they offer to their clients (Ibid, 2006). Owing to its well-designed website and lack of physical shops, the company is able to cut a great deal of costs from its operations, enabling customers to enjoy reduced jewelry prices.
In addition, due to holding numerous advertising campaigns both off and online, majority of the clients are able to visit Blue Nile Inc.'s website, creating an advantage for the company as it increases product awareness to customers (Porter, 2006). By using the website, Blue Nile Inc. is also able to reach its target market in order to sell their products. The cost of advertising had gone up in the past and this had forced the company to pull out from advertising through their website. To compensate for this, they ensured that its jewelry consultants were efficiently trained so as to give the clients quality information as regards the products during sale of their products (Porter, 2006). As a result, the company being in a position to fulfill its order's operations designed to suit their individual needs increased clients' confidence and value.
The main performance indicators for Blue Nile Inc. were customer support and service held in high regard by the company. It believed in the purchasing power of its clients that needs to be respected at all times (Porter, 2006). Product line expansion was observed as the last performance indicator for the company. Blue Nile Inc. was in a better position to calculate clients' response and opinions as concerns new products in the market before they could actually be introduced since it could show case and sell jewelry still stocked by suppliers (Porter, 2006). Another financial and strategy performance indicator for Blue Nile Inc. is that of internal motivation. Provision of stock options to non-employee directors, officers and employees were instituted in the stock-based compensation plans by the company (Ibid, 2006). The company used a supply chain considered the better option being offered by traditional distributors and wholesalers of diamond.
The company's equity in the jewelry market is enhanced through its online business model since it incurs minimal expenses as regards its operations in the process of carrying out its business activities and transactions (Porter, 2006). Offering the customers reduced product prices increase their loyalty in the products and services offered by Blue Nile Inc., placing the company in a favorable position in the market as compared to those running mortar and brick establishments (Ibid, 2006). Strategy performance indicators of Blue Nile Inc. are also determined by provision of excellent and effective communication mechanisms focusing on the need to provide the client with information they would need to carry out online transactions (Porter, 2006). Therefore, supply chain ought to be faultless in order to encourage timely delivery of products once a client has completed the purchasing process. Financial and strategy performance indicators success is determined by the popularity of its products and services as indicated in the financial statements (Porter, 2006).
Recommendations
Blue Nile Inc. should consider presence of physical stores in addition to having an online shop within specific high ends market, as this would contribute to the enhancement of distribution network of the jewelry (Porter, 2006). The company should also be aware of the stiff competition the current jewelry market is facing as new and upcoming businesses venturing into this kind of business are rapidly emerging as the population grows. The Company or the CEO can thus decide to formulate its niche in the jewelry market through specialization of specific and chosen jewelry (Ibid, 2006). This would in turn enable the company to take as much advantage of the economies of scale as possible. By doing this, it will also colonize the jewelry market for the particular jewelry (Porter, 2006).
Specializing on a particular kind of diamond or gemstone, the quality is bound to improve, surviving any potential threat of competition. The company should consider maintaining a given line of product and/or service in order to ensure sustainability through quality despite the company's CEO claiming that Blue Nile is comfortable being a monopoly in a fine collection of high-quality diamond (Porter, 2006).
CONCLUSION
It has been observed that online business model offers Blue Nile Inc. some form of competitive advantage as regards its equity in the jewelry market. By including costs as part of SG&A expenses, Blue Nile Inc. drastically reduces financial burden to their clients and are thus in a position to expand its product line, offering a wide range of jewelry having differentiated pricing.

History[edit]
The company that became Blue Nile began in 1995 when Doug Williams of Williams & Son Inc. of Seattle started a website to sell diamonds online.[3] Mark C. Vadon, then a management consultant at Bain & Company, purchased a diamond engagement ring from the site in 1998.[3] In 1999, Vadon raised $6 million to purchase 85% of the company and improve the website.[3] The company’s name was changed to Blue Nile in November 1999.[4] During the next year, the company raised an additional $44 million.[3] Investors included Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[4] Blue Nile raised $76 million in its IPO on May 18, 2004. Merrill Lynch & Co., Bear Stearns Cos. and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC managed the IPO, sharing fees of $5.4 million.[4] The initial public offering of shares in Blue Nile Inc, rose 39% in first-day trading, closing at $28.40.
Although the company had $44 million in revenue in 2000, it lost $30 million because it spent $40 million in television advertising.[3] Its investors contributed an additional $7 million in 2001.[3] In 2006, Blue Nile sold $197 million in engagement rings and wedding bands, compared to $186 million for Tiffany & Co.[5]
On Nov, 8, 2011, CEO Diane Irvine, who had been with the company for 12 years and its CEO since 2008, abruptly resigned.[6] Irvine was replaced on an interim basis by senior vice president and general manager of international Vijay Talwar.[7] In March 2012, Harvey Kanter, former CEO of MooseJaw, was named the new CEO.[8]
In 2015, Blue Nile reported net sales of US$473 million and net income of US$9.7 million.[1] Blue Nile promotes itself as a supplier of ethically sourced diamonds and endorses a zero-tolerance policy towards conflict diamonds.[9]
In the summer of 2015, Blue Nile opened their first webroom at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, N.Y., the company plans to open three more webrooms in 2016 at The Westchester mall in White Plains, N.Y., at Tysons Corner Center mall in Fairfax County, Va., and at Washington Square mall outside of Portland.[10]
Blue Nile was designated a Bizrate Circle of Excellence Award winner in 2016.[11]
In June 2017, former Chief Digital Officer of Target, Jason Goldberger, was appointed Blue Nile's CEO. Goldberger also spent time at Gilt Groupe, Hayneedle and Amazon.[12]
Acquisition[edit]
Bain Capital Private Equity and Bow Street LLC acquired Blue Nile, on February 17, 2017, for $40.75 per share (approximately $500 million).[13] First announced on November 7, 2016, shares of Blue Nile Inc. jumped 34%.[14] The transaction was approved by company shareholders on February 2, 2017. Trading in Blue Nile’s common stock on NASDAQ ended February 21.[15]

History[edit]
The company that became Blue Nile began in 1995 when Doug Williams of Williams & Son Inc. of Seattle started a website to sell diamonds online.[3] Mark C. Vadon, then a management consultant at Bain & Company, purchased a diamond engagement ring from the site in 1998.[3] In 1999, Vadon raised $6 million to purchase 85% of the company and improve the website.[3] The company’s name was changed to Blue Nile in November 1999.[4] During the next year, the company raised an additional $44 million.[3] Investors included Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[4] Blue Nile raised $76 million in its IPO on May 18, 2004. Merrill Lynch & Co., Bear Stearns Cos. and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC managed the IPO, sharing fees of $5.4 million.[4] The initial public offering of shares in Blue Nile Inc, rose 39% in first-day trading, closing at $28.40.
Although the company had $44 million in revenue in 2000, it lost $30 million because it spent $40 million in television advertising.[3] Its investors contributed an additional $7 million in 2001.[3] In 2006, Blue Nile sold $197 million in engagement rings and wedding bands, compared to $186 million for Tiffany & Co.[5]
On Nov, 8, 2011, CEO Diane Irvine, who had been with the company for 12 years and its CEO since 2008, abruptly resigned.[6] Irvine was replaced on an interim basis by senior vice president and general manager of international Vijay Talwar.[7] In March 2012, Harvey Kanter, former CEO of MooseJaw, was named the new CEO.[8]
In 2015, Blue Nile reported net sales of US$473 million and net income of US$9.7 million.[1] Blue Nile promotes itself as a supplier of ethically sourced diamonds and endorses a zero-tolerance policy towards conflict diamonds.[9]
In the summer of 2015, Blue Nile opened their first webroom at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, N.Y., the company plans to open three more webrooms in 2016 at The Westchester mall in White Plains, N.Y., at Tysons Corner Center mall in Fairfax County, Va., and at Washington Square mall outside of Portland.[10]
Blue Nile was designated a Bizrate Circle of Excellence Award winner in 2016.[11]
In June 2017, former Chief Digital Officer of Target, Jason Goldberger, was appointed Blue Nile's CEO. Goldberger also spent time at Gilt Groupe, Hayneedle and Amazon.[12]
Acquisition[edit]
Bain Capital Private Equity and Bow Street LLC acquired Blue Nile, on February 17, 2017, for $40.75 per share (approximately $500 million).[13] First announced on November 7, 2016, shares of Blue Nile Inc. jumped 34%.[14] The transaction was approved by company shareholders on February 2, 2017. Trading in Blue Nile’s common stock on NASDAQ ended February 21.[15]

History[edit]
The company that became Blue Nile began in 1995 when Doug Williams of Williams & Son Inc. of Seattle started a website to sell diamonds online.[3] Mark C. Vadon, then a management consultant at Bain & Company, purchased a diamond engagement ring from the site in 1998.[3] In 1999, Vadon raised $6 million to purchase 85% of the company and improve the website.[3] The company’s name was changed to Blue Nile in November 1999.[4] During the next year, the company raised an additional $44 million.[3] Investors included Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[4] Blue Nile raised $76 million in its IPO on May 18, 2004. Merrill Lynch & Co., Bear Stearns Cos. and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC managed the IPO, sharing fees of $5.4 million.[4] The initial public offering of shares in Blue Nile Inc, rose 39% in first-day trading, closing at $28.40.
Although the company had $44 million in revenue in 2000, it lost $30 million because it spent $40 million in television advertising.[3] Its investors contributed an additional $7 million in 2001.[3] In 2006, Blue Nile sold $197 million in engagement rings and wedding bands, compared to $186 million for Tiffany & Co.[5]
On Nov, 8, 2011, CEO Diane Irvine, who had been with the company for 12 years and its CEO since 2008, abruptly resigned.[6] Irvine was replaced on an interim basis by senior vice president and general manager of international Vijay Talwar.[7] In March 2012, Harvey Kanter, former CEO of MooseJaw, was named the new CEO.[8]
In 2015, Blue Nile reported net sales of US$473 million and net income of US$9.7 million.[1] Blue Nile promotes itself as a supplier of ethically sourced diamonds and endorses a zero-tolerance policy towards conflict diamonds.[9]
In the summer of 2015, Blue Nile opened their first webroom at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, N.Y., the company plans to open three more webrooms in 2016 at The Westchester mall in White Plains, N.Y., at Tysons Corner Center mall in Fairfax County, Va., and at Washington Square mall outside of Portland.[10]
Blue Nile was designated a Bizrate Circle of Excellence Award winner in 2016.[11]
In June 2017, former Chief Digital Officer of Target, Jason Goldberger, was appointed Blue Nile's CEO. Goldberger also spent time at Gilt Groupe, Hayneedle and Amazon.[12]
Acquisition[edit]
Bain Capital Private Equity and Bow Street LLC acquired Blue Nile, on February 17, 2017, for $40.75 per share (approximately $500 million).[13] First announced on November 7, 2016, shares of Blue Nile Inc. jumped 34%.[14] The transaction was approved by company shareholders on February 2, 2017. Trading in Blue Nile’s common stock on NASDAQ ended February 21.[15]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
