If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston

In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]




Credit Suisse headquarters as of 2009


In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]
Post financial crisis
According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston

In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]




Credit Suisse headquarters as of 2009


In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]
Post financial crisis
According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Investment advice.
























Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston




A logo from 1972


In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]




Credit Suisse headquarters as of 2009


In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]
Post financial crisis
According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston

In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]

In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]

According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Investment advice.
























Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston

In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]




Credit Suisse headquarters as of 2009


In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]
Post financial crisis
According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston

In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]




Credit Suisse headquarters as of 2009


In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]
Post financial crisis
According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

                Credit Suisse Group AG operates as a financial services company, which provides investment banking and advisory services. It operates through six segments: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management, Asia Pacific, Global Markets, Investment Banking & Capital Markets and Strategic Resolution Unit. The Swiss Universal Bank segment offers advice and a wide range of financial solutions to private, corporate and institutional clients primarily domiciled in the Group's home market Switzerland. The International Wealth Management division provides private banking financial solutions to wealthy private clients and external asset managers in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. The Asia Pacific division offers integrated private banking and investment banking financial solutions to wealthy individuals, institutional investors and corporate clients in the Asia Pacific region, empowered with the tools of the Group's global resources. The Global Markets division includes a broad range of equities and fixed income products and services and focuses on client driven businesses and supporting the Group's private banking and wealth management businesses and its clients. The Investment Banking & Capital Markets division offers a broad range of investment banking services to corporations, financial institutions, financial sponsors and UHNWI and sovereign clients. The Strategic Resolution Unit was created to facilitate the immediate right sizing of the business divisions from a capital perspective and includes remaining portfolios from the former non-strategic units plus transfers of additional exposures from the business divisions. The company was founded by Alfred Escher on July 5, 1856 and is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

It operates through six segments: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management, Asia Pacific, Global Markets, Investment Banking & Capital Markets and Strategic Resolution Unit. The Swiss Universal Bank segment offers advice and a wide range of financial solutions to private, corporate and institutional clients primarily domiciled in the Group's home market Switzerland. The International Wealth Management division provides private banking financial solutions to wealthy private clients and external asset managers in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. The Asia Pacific division offers integrated private banking and investment banking financial solutions to wealthy individuals, institutional investors and corporate clients in the Asia Pacific region, empowered with the tools of the Group's global resources. The Global Markets division includes a broad range of equities and fixed income products and services and focuses on client driven businesses and supporting the Group's private banking and wealth management businesses and its clients. The Investment Banking & Capital Markets division offers a broad range of investment banking services to corporations, financial institutions, financial sponsors and UHNWI and sovereign clients. The Strategic Resolution Unit was created to facilitate the immediate right sizing of the business divisions from a capital perspective and includes remaining portfolios from the former non-strategic units plus transfers of additional exposures from the business divisions.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Credit Suisse Group is a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, headquartered in Zürich, that operates the Credit Suisse Bank and other financial services investments. The company is organized as a stock corporation with four divisions: Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management, and a Shared Services Group that provides marketing and support to the other three divisions.
Credit Suisse was founded by Alfred Escher in 1856 under the name Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, English: Swiss Credit Institution) in order to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking in response to the elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston in 1978. After a large failed loan put First Boston under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988. In the 1990s, Credit Suisse acquired the Winterthur Group, Swiss Volksbank, Swiss American Securities Inc. (SASI) and Bank Leu among others. In the year 2000, it added the U.S. investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The company restructured itself in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It was one of the least affected banks during the global financial crisis, but afterwards began shrinking its investment business, executing layoffs and cutting costs. During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of conspiring to help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.[4][5]
In 2014, Credit Suisse had 888.2 USD Bn of assets under management (AuD) according to the Scorpio Partnership (an increase of 9.5% on 2013).[6]

Corporate structure




Credit Suisse headquarters at Paradeplatz in Zürich


Credit Suisse Group AG is organized as a joint-stock company registered in Zürich that operates as a holding company. It owns the Credit Suisse bank and other interests in the financial services business. Credit Suisse is governed by a board of directors, its shareholders and independent auditors. The Board of Directors organize the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders while investors with large stakes in the company determine the agenda. Shareholders elect auditors for one-year terms,[7] approve the annual report and other financial statements, and have other powers granted by law.[7] Shareholders elect members of the board of directors to serve a three-year term based on candidates nominated by the Chairman's and Governance committee and the Board of Directors meet six times a year to vote on company resolutions.[8] The Board sets Credit Suisse's business strategies and approves its compensation principles based on guidance from the compensation committee. It also has the authority to create committees that delegate specific management functions.
Credit Suisse has two divisions, Private Banking & Wealth Management and Investment Banking. A Shared Services department provides support functions like risk management, legal, IT and marketing to all areas. Operations are divided into four regions: Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and the Asian Pacific. Credit Suisse Private Banking has wealth management, corporate and institutional businesses. Credit Suisse Investment Banking handles securities, investment research, trading, prime brokerage and capital procurement. Credit Suisse Asset Management sells investment classes, alternative investments, real-estate, equities, fixed income products and other financial products.[9]
History
Early history
Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, "the spiritual father of the railway law of 1852," for his work defeating the idea of a state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization.[10][11] Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system.[12] Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days.[13] The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans.[12] In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.[14]

Credit Suisse played a substantial role in the economic development of Switzerland, helping the country develop its currency system,[13] funding entrepreneurs[11] and investing in the Gotthard railway, which connected Switzerland to the European rail system in 1882.[12] Credit Suisse helped fund the creation of Switzerland's electrical grid through its participation with Elektrobank (now called Elektrowatt), a coalition of organizations that co-financed Switzerland's electrical grid.[15] According to The Handbook on the History of European Banks, "Switzerland's young electricity industry came to assume the same importance as support for railway construction 40 years earlier."[12] The bank also helped fund the effort to disarm and imprison French troops that crossed into Swiss borders in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.[12][14] By the end of the war, Credit Suisse had become the largest bank in Switzerland.[13]
Throughout the late 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and insurance companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own sugar beet factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.[12][14]

In the early 1900s Credit Suisse began catering to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts.[14] The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel.[11] The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts.[12][16] During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts.[17] After World War II, a substantial portion of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts.[17] Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates.[18] This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996[19] that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion.[20][21][22] The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s,[11] after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.[23]
Acquisitions, growth and First Boston




A logo from 1972


In 1978, White, Weld & Company dropped its partnership with Credit Suisse after it was bought by Merrill Lynch. To replace the partnership with White, Credit Suisse partnered with First Boston to create Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe and bought a 44 percent stake in First Boston's US operations.[24]
In 1987, the Group acquired the blue chip London stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. Originally established by Irish aristocrat Charles Armytage-Moore and sportsman Walter Buckmaster, who had met at Repton School. As stockbrokers they were very well connected, had developed a good private client business, which at one time included John Maynard Keynes.
Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands were later created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo.[25][26] According to an article in The New York Times, First Boston became "the superstar of the Euromarkets" by buying stakes in American companies that wanted to issue bonds.[26] In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green for the purchase of the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston.[13] Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business,[27] which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the "burning bed" deal, because the Federal Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.[13]

In the late 1990s Credit Suisse executed an aggressive acquisition strategy.[11] The bank acquired Bank Leu, known as Switzerland's oldest bank, in 1990.[28][29] In 1993 Credit Suisse outbid UBS for a controlling stake in Switzerland's fifth largest bank, Swiss Volksbank in a $1.1 billion deal.[30] It also merged with Winterthur Group in 1997 for about $9 billion[31] and acquired the asset management division of Warburg, Pincus & Co. in 1999 for $650 million.[32] Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was purchased for $11.5 billion in 2000.[11][33]
In 1996 Credit Suisse restructured as the Credit Suisse Group with four divisions: Credit Suisse Volksbank (later called Credit Suisse Bank) for domestic banking, Credit Suisse Private Banking, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston for corporate and investment banking. The restructure was expected to cost the company $800 million and result in 7,000 lost jobs, but save $560 million a year.[34][35] While Credit Suisse First Boston had been struggling, Credit Suisse's overall profits had grown 20 percent over the prior year, reaching $664 million.[34] In 1999 Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency temporarily suspended the financial-products division's license to operate in Japan for "window dressing," the practice of selling derivatives that are often used by bank clients to hide losses.[36]

In the 2000s Credit Suisse executed a series of restructures. In 2002 the bank was consolidated into two entities: Credit Suisse First Boston for investments and Credit Suisse Financial Services. A third unit was added in 2004 for insurance.[11] Credit Suisse restructured again in 2004 under what it calls the "one bank" model. Under the restructuring, every board had a mix of executives from all three divisions. It also changed the compensation and commission models to encourage cross-division referrals and created a "solution partners" group that functions between the investment and private banking divisions.[37] Following the restructure Credit Suisse's private banking division grew 19 percent per year despite the economic crisis. The firm bumped long-time rival UBS off the number one position in Euromoney's private banking poll.[37] In 2006, Credit Suisse acknowledged misconduct for helping Iran and other countries hide transactions from US authorities and paid a $536 million settlement.[38][39] The same year it merged Bank Leu AG, Clariden Holding AG, Bank Hofmann AG and BGP Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale into a new company called Clariden Leu.[40]
The increasing importance of sustainability and the related commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an increasingly sophisticated and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.[41]
In 2009 Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth sued Credit Suisse when the bank attempted to collect on $286 million in loan debt during Yellowstone's bankruptcy proceedings.[42] The debtor had borrowed more than $300 million for the business, but used a large portion of it for personal use before eventually filing for bankruptcy.[43] Four lawsuits were filed from other resorts seeking $24 billion in damages alleging Credit Suisse created loans with the intention of taking over their properties upon default.[44]
Post financial crisis
According to The Wall Street Journal, "Credit Suisse survived the credit crisis better than many competitors."[39] Credit Suisse had $902 million in writedowns for subprime holdings and the same amount for leveraged loans,[45] but it did not have to borrow from the government.[46] Along with other banks, Credit Suisse was investigated and sued by US authorities for bundling mortgage loans with securities, misrepresenting the risks of underlying mortgages during the housing boom.[47][48] Following the crisis, Credit Suisse cut more than one-trillion in assets and made plans to cut its investment banking arm 37 percent by 2014. It reduced emphasis on investment banking and focused on private banking and wealth management.[49][50] In July 2011, Credit Suisse cut 2,000 jobs in response to a weaker than expected economic recovery[51] and later merged its asset management with the private bank group to cut additional costs.[52]
A series of international investigations took place in the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. The Brazilian government investigated 13 former and current Credit Suisse employees in 2008.[11] The investigation led to arrests that year and in 2009 as part of a larger crackdown in Brazil.[53][54] Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US Justice Department in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.[55][56] German authorities found that citizens were using insurance policies of a Bermuda-based Credit Suisse subsidiary to earn tax-free interest.[57] In November 2012, Credit Suisse's asset management division was merged with the private banking arm.[58]
In September 2012, the Swiss government gave banks like Credit Suisse permission to provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes.[59] In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as to whether it was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation.[60] Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes.[61] The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.[62]
In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied claims it had been drawn into a Swiss competition probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks.[63] In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999.[64] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time.[65] Holder also said "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." Credit Suisse shares rose 1% on the day the $2.6 billion penalty was announced.[66]
On 10 March 2015, it was announced that Tidjane Thiam, the CEO of Prudential would leave to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse.[67] In September 2016, Brian Chin was appointed Chief Executive of Global Markets and joined the executive board of the bank. At this time, it was also announced that Eric M. Varvel was appointed president and CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA).[68]

Investment advice.
























Credit Suisse endorses a strategy called bancassurance of trying to be a single company that offers every common financial services product.[69][70] The investment bank is intended for companies and wealthy individuals with more than 50,000 euro.[71]
Credit Suisse developed the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused exclusively on the chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method.[72] As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur.[73] The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others.[74] Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.[75]
Credit Suisse produces one of the six hedge funds following European stock indices that are used to evaluate the performance of the markets.[76][77] The investment bank also has a 30 percent ownership in hedge fund investment firm York Capital Management. York sells hedge funds independently to its own clients, while Credit Suisse also offers them to private banking clients.[78] Credit Suisse manages the financial instruments of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse long/short equity index (originally called Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Indexes).[79]
According to a 2011 article in SeekingAlpha, Credit Suisse's investment managers favor financial, technology and energy sector stocks.[80] The bank's head of equity investments in Europe said the team focuses on "value with an emphasis on free cashflow." She also has an interest in companies undergoing management changes that may influence the stock price.[81] According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, the head of Credit Suisse's International Focus Fund keeps a portfolio of only 40–50 stocks, instead of the industry-norm of more than 100.[82] Credit Suisse publishes its investment advice in four publications: Compass, Viewpoints, Research and the Credit Suisse Investment Committee Report.[83]
Reputation and rankings
Credit Suisse is a member of Wall Street's bulge bracket, a list of less than a dozen of the largest and most profitable banks. The company has been identified as one of the world's most important banks, upon which international financial stability depends.[84][85] The bank is also one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies.[86]
Credit Suisse has been recognized as the world's best private bank by Euromoney's Global Private Banking Survey[87] and as the best European Equity Manager by Global Investors.[81] In polls by Euromoney, it has been ranked as the top private bank and the best bank in Switzerland.[37] As of 2004, Credit Suisse was first in volume of high-yield transactions, second for corporate high-yield bond insurance and third for IPO underwriting.[88] The Securities Data Company ranked Credit Suisse as the fourth best place for financial advice for mergers and acquisitions in the US in 1995 and sixth for domestic equity issues.[34] Credit Suisse has been recognized by the Asset Triple A Awards.[88] In 2005 Credit Suisse was ranked as the second best prime broker by Institutional Investor.[88]
Work environment
Credit Suisse is more internationally minded than most European banks.[22][88] According to WetFeet's Insider Guide, Credit Suisse offers more travel opportunities, greater levels of responsibility and more client interaction than new employees get at competing firms, but is known for long hours. Analysts report 60- to 110-hour work-weeks.
Roles and responsibilities are less stringent and the environment is pleasant despite hours being "the most grueling on Wall Street."[89] Vault's Insider's Guide reached similar conclusions, noting above-average training, executive access and openness matched with reports of 80- to 100-hour work-weeks.[88]

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
