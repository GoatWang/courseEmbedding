KalVista Pharmaceuticals Appoints Edward P. Feener, Ph.D. As Chief Scientific Officer






GlobeNewswire



Nov 29, 2016 7:30 AM EST













 




























































 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and PORTON DOWN, United Kingdom, Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KALV), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors, today announced the appointment of Edward P. Feener, Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) of the Company. Dr. Feener is a scientific co-founder of KalVista and a recognized authority on plasma kallikrein. His laboratory at the Joslin Diabetes Center has made groundbreaking discoveries on the role of plasma kallikrein in vascular disorders and was the first to identify plasma kallikrein as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic macular edema. Dr. Feener has more than 27 years of research experience in vascular biology and diabetic complications, contributing to more than 80 scientific publications during his career. Prior to taking his new role at KalVista, he was an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Senior Investigator in the Section on Vascular Cell Biology at the Joslin Diabetes Center, a research and clinical affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Boston University and completed postdoctoral training at the Joslin Center and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Feener has been working closely with the KalVista team on the therapeutic opportunities for plasma kallikrein inhibitors, and as CSO will lead the new target discovery and preclinical pharmacology programs at KalVista's laboratories in Cambridge, MA. His focus in this role will be to evaluate new therapeutic opportunities for plasma kallikrein inhibitors and perform preclinical studies to support the development of additional protease inhibitors in KalVista's drug pipeline. "I am delighted that Dr. Feener has joined KalVista in this new position," said Andrew Crockett, Chief Executive Officer of KalVista. "I am confident that his exceptional understanding of vascular biology and the role of plasma kallikrein in vascular diseases will prove invaluable as we seek to build our pipeline of novel medicines and advance them into and through clinical development."

KalVista Pharmaceuticals Appoints Edward P. Feener, Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and PORTON DOWN, United Kingdom, Nov.  29, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KALV), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors, today announced the appointment of Edward P. Feener, Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) of the Company. Dr. Feener is a scientific co-founder of KalVista and a recognized authority on plasma kallikrein. His laboratory at the Joslin Diabetes Center has made groundbreaking discoveries on the role of plasma kallikrein in vascular disorders and was the first to identify plasma kallikrein as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic macular edema.

Clinical translation of these findings could lead to novel treatments for life- and vision-threatening edema and other vascular disorders that are caused by the over activity of plasma kallikrein. KalVista has made significant progress in identifying and developing highly selective and potent small molecules that block plasma kallikrein action and could have multiple therapeutic applications. While my research opportunities at Joslin have been extraordinary, I am very much looking forward to my new position in KalVista at this exciting point in its development and having a more direct role in bringing new therapies to patients.” In connection with his employment, Dr. Feener is receiving an inducement grant of 20,055 options to purchase shares of KalVista common stock. The shares subject to the option will vest 1/48 per month. This disclosure is made pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). About KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc.KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceuticals company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet need. The initial focus is on inhibitors of plasma kallikrein, which is an important component of the body’s inflammatory response, and which in excess can lead to increased vascular permeability, edema and inflammation. KalVista has developed a proprietary portfolio of novel, small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors initially targeting hereditary angioedema (HAE) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The Company has created a structurally diverse portfolio of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors from which it plans to select multiple drug candidates to advance into clinical trials for HAE. In August 2016, KalVista commenced a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial for KVD818, the first of its orally delivered molecules for the treatment of HAE. KalVista’s most advanced program, an intravitreally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitor known as KVD001, has successfully completed its first‑in‑human study in patients with DME and is being prepared for Phase 2 studies in 2017.

Edward P. Feener Ph.D..Dr. Feener's laboratory performs basic research on biochemical and cellular mechanisms that mediate the vascular complications of diabetes, especially diabetic retinopathy and stroke. A major focus of his laboratory is on the contributions of the kallikrein kinin system and intrinsic coagulation cascade on vasogenic edema, neuronal dysfunction, hemostasis, and thrombosis.Diabetic RetinopathyDiabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss. Although anti-VEGF therapies are often effective in improving vision and reducing macular thickness in patients with DME, a large proportion of patients do not fully respond to this approach. A major goal of the Feener lab is the identification of VEGF-independent mechanisms that contribute to DME. The laboratory utilizes a combination of research strategies including proteomics of human ocular fluids, mechanistic and imaging studies using animal models, and molecular and biochemical analyses. This work has led to the identification of the plasma kallikrein kinin system as a potential cause of DME. Studies are currently investigating the effects of the plasma kallikrein and its downstream effectors, including kinins and of the intrinsic coagulation cascade components, on retinal edema and visual function in rodent models of diabetic retinopathy.Cerebrovascular Disease and StrokeDiabetes increases the risk and worsens the outcomes of stroke, which is a major cause of mortality and adult disability. Dr. Feener's laboratory investigates the effects of diabetes on cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia-induced edema and infarction. Studies are ongoing to characterize the role of plasma kallikrein and the intrinsic coagulation system on vascular permeability, edema, and hematoma expansion during stroke in the presence of high blood glucose. Studies are also underway to characterize the role of the plasma kallikrein system on vascular, glial, and neuron dysfunction and cell death during stroke in diabetic rodent models.

KalVista Pharmaceuticals has announced the appointment of Edward P. Feener, Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) of the Company. Dr. Feener is a scientific co-founder of KalVista and a recognized authority on plasma kallikrein. His laboratory at the Joslin Diabetes Center has made groundbreaking discoveries on the role of plasma kallikrein in vascular disorders and was the first to identify plasma kallikrein as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic macular edema.
Dr. Feener has more than 27 years of research experience in vascular biology and diabetic complications, contributing to more than 80 scientific publications during his career. Prior to taking his new role at KalVista, he was an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Senior Investigator in the Section on Vascular Cell Biology at the Joslin Diabetes Center, a research and clinical affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Boston University and completed postdoctoral training at the Joslin Center and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Feener has been working closely with the KalVista team on the therapeutic opportunities for plasma kallikrein inhibitors, and as CSO will lead the new target discovery and preclinical pharmacology programs at KalVista’s laboratories in Cambridge, MA. His focus in this role will be to evaluate new therapeutic opportunities for plasma kallikrein inhibitors and perform preclinical studies to support the development of additional protease inhibitors in KalVista’s drug pipeline.
“I am delighted that Dr. Feener has joined KalVista in this new position,” said Andrew Crockett, Chief Executive Officer of KalVista. “I am confident that his exceptional understanding of vascular biology and the role of plasma kallikrein in vascular diseases will prove invaluable as we seek to build our pipeline of novel medicines and advance them into and through clinical development.”
Dr. Feener added: “The basic research conducted in my lab at the Joslin, and by other leading laboratories, has identified plasma kallikrein as an exciting new potential therapeutic target for certain vascular diseases. Clinical translation of these findings could lead to novel treatments for life- and vision-threatening edema and other vascular disorders that are caused by the over activity of plasma kallikrein. KalVista has made significant progress in identifying and developing highly selective and potent small molecules that block plasma kallikrein action and could have multiple therapeutic applications. While my research opportunities at Joslin have been extraordinary, I am very much looking forward to my new position in KalVista at this exciting point in its development and having a more direct role in bringing new therapies to patients.”
In connection with his employment, Dr. Feener is receiving an inducement grant of 20,055 options to purchase shares of KalVista common stock. The shares subject to the option will vest 1/48 per month. This disclosure is made pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

About KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc.KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceuticals company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet need. The initial focus is on inhibitors of plasma kallikrein, which is an important component of the body’s inflammatory response, and which in excess can lead to increased vascular permeability, edema and inflammation. KalVista has developed a proprietary portfolio of novel, small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors initially targeting hereditary angioedema (HAE) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The Company has created a structurally diverse portfolio of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors from which it plans to select multiple drug candidates to advance into clinical trials for HAE. In August 2016, KalVista commenced a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial for KVD818, the first of its orally delivered molecules for the treatment of HAE. KalVista’s most advanced program, an intravitreally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitor known as KVD001, has successfully completed its first‑in‑human study in patients with DME and is being prepared for Phase 2 studies in 2017.
