	LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 




	This
	Annual Report on Form 10-K contain “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
	Reform Act of 1995, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use
	of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “will,” “forecasts,” “projects,”
	“intends,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning. One can identify them by the fact that they
	do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address our growth strategy, financial results
	and product and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could
	cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements. These factors may include inaccurate assumptions and a broad
	variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward looking statement can
	be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.




	 




	These
	risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include, and are not limited to:




	 






	 




	●




	our
	growth strategies;






	 






	 




	●




	our
	anticipated future operation and profitability;






	 






	 




	●




	our
	future financing capabilities and anticipated need for working capital;






	 






	 




	●




	the
	anticipated trends in our industry;






	 






	 




	●




	acquisitions
	of other companies or assets that we might undertake in the future;






	 






	 




	●




	our
	operations in China and the regulatory, economic and political conditions in China; and






	 






	 




	●




	current
	and future competition.






	 




	In
	addition, factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this
	Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption “Management’s Discussion and
	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as those discussed in other documents we file with the
	SEC. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements,
	except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
	statements.

	History
	of the Company





	 




	Wave
	Sync Corp. (the “Company”), formerly known as China Bio-Energy Corp., formerly known as China INSOnline Corp., was
	initially incorporated on December 23, 1988 as Lifequest Medical, Inc. (“DEXT”) as a Delaware corporation. On December
	6, 2010, the Company entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”) to a certain share exchange agreement dated November
	12, 2010 with Ding Neng Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company (“Ding Neng Holdings”). This share exchange agreement
	and the Amendment provides for an acquisition transaction in which the Company, through the issuance of 25,875,000 shares of its
	common stock, par value $0.001, representing 90% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the closing
	of this acquisition, acquired 100% of Ding Neng Holdings.




	 




	The
	closing of this acquisition took place on February 10, 2011, on which date, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement
	as amended, the Company shall acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of Ding Neng Holdings from the shareholders of
	Ding Neng Holdings; and the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings shall transfer and contribute all of their issued and outstanding
	shares of Ding Neng Holdings to the Company. Accordingly, the Company, via Ding Neng Holdings, held 100% of Ding Neng Bio-technology
	Co., Limited, a Hong Kong Company, which held 100% of Zhangzhou Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned
	enterprise in China (“Fuhua Biomass”), which, via a series of variable interest entity (or VIE) arrangements, controlled
	the operating company Fujian Zhangzhou Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Ding Neng Bio-tech”). In connection of
	this share exchange, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.




	 




	In
	or about early October 2011, Mr. Nie Xinfeng, the Company’s former chairman of the Board of Directors, took possession,
	among other things, the company seal, financial seal, and original books and records of Ding Neng Bio-tech. Since then, the Company
	was prevented from obtaining and did not have access to the financial information of Ding Neng Bio-tech.




	 




	It
	is within the Company’s knowledge that from late 2011 to 2014, due to change in law, unfavorable market conditions, and
	lack of effective management, the business of Ding Neng Bio-tech deteriorated significantly and eventually defaulted on various
	loan obligations. The Company also believes that Ding Neng Bio-tech guaranteed some of Mr. Nie’s personal debts. From 2011
	to 2014, multiple legal proceedings were brought against Ding Neng Bio-tech by creditors, service vendors and former employees
	of the Company and against Mr. Nie by his creditors. As a result, substantially all of Ding Neng Bio-tech’s assets were
	seized or disposed of by Ding Neng Bio-tech’s or Mr. Nie’s creditors. Eventually, Ding Neng Bio-tech completely ceased
	its operations.




	 




	On
	June 4, 2015, Fuhua Biomass filed a civil action in Haicang District People’s Court of Xiamen, Fujian, PRC (the “Court”)
	against Ding Neng Bio-tech, alleging that the purposes of those certain Consulting Service Agreement, Operating Agreement, Pledge
	and Security Agreement, Option Agreement, and Voting Rights Proxy Agreement (the “VIE Agreements”) entered into by
	Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech on October 28, 2010 had been frustrated, and that these VIE Agreements should be terminated.
	Fuhua Biomass alleged that Ding Neng Bio-tech did not make any payment of service fees to Fuhua Biomass, and that Ding Neng Bio-tech
	failed to perfect the security interest in the pledged stock. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via in-court mediation directed
	by the Court. As a result, Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech entered into binding settlement (i) to terminate the VIE Agreements,
	(ii) that Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech did not have any other disputes over this case, and (iii) that the litigation fee
	in the amount of RMB10,000 (approximately $1,610.5) would be borne by Ding Neng Bio-tech.




	 




	Given
	that the Company was unable to exercise effective control over Ding Neng Bio-tech or gain access to Ding Neng Bio-tech’s
	financial information since 2011, and that the VIE Agreements were terminated, the Company deconsolidated Ding Neng Bio-tech’s
	financial results.

	During
	a review of the Company’s financial statements by its auditor, the auditor examined the share register and all transactional
	bought note, sold notes, and instruments of transfer provided by the Secretary of the Company. There was no evidence that ownership
	of Ding Neng Holdings was ever registered to be transferred and held by the Company. The Company also discovered that Ding Neng
	Holdings was delinquent and defunct. Accordingly, it was unable to determine whether the Company was registered as the sole shareholder
	of Ding Neng Holdings pursuant to the share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010, as amended on December 6, 2010. As a result,
	the Company excluded the accounts of Ding Neng Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
	and accompanying notes as contained herein. The Company has written off all investments made in Ding Neng Holdings as loss on
	investment in subsidiary.




	 





	Share
	Purchase Agreement with EGOOS Mobile Technology Co. Ltd.





	 




	On
	October 19, 2015, the Registrant entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with EGOOS
	Mobile Technology Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands holding company (“EGOOS BVI”), which owns 100% of EGOOS
	Mobile Technology Company Limited, a Hong Kong company (“EGOOS HK”), which owns 100% of Move the Purchase Consulting
	Management (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“WOFE” or “Yigou”), a foreign investment enterprise organized under the
	laws of the PRC, and which has, through various contractual agreements, management control and the rights to the profits of Guangzhou
	Yuzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC as a variable interest entity(“Guangzhou
	Yuzhi”), which owns 100% of Shenzhen Qianhai Exce-card Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Shenzhen Exce-card”),
	which owns 100% of Guangzhou Rongsheng Information Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Guangzhou Rongsheng”,
	together with Guangzhou Yuzhi and Shenzhen Exce-card, is collectively referred to herein as “Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries”),
	and the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries engage in research, development, marketing and distribution
	of inlays/audio chips for audio bank card products.




	 




	The
	Share Purchase Agreement provides for an acquisition transaction (the “Acquisition”) in which the Registrant, through
	the issuance of a convertible note in the principal sum of Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars ($15,000,000) to EGOOS BVI’s sole
	shareholder, will acquire 100% of EGOOS BVI.




	 




	The
	closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”) took place on October 19, 2015 (the “Closing Date”). On the
	Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Registrant acquired all of the outstanding equity securities
	of EGOOS BVI from the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI; and the shareholder of EGOOS BVI transferred and contributed all of his issued
	and outstanding shares of EGOOS BVI to the Registrant. In exchange, the Registrant issued to the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI
	a convertible note, which was subsequently converted into an aggregate of 15,000,000 post-Reverse Split (as defined below) Common
	Shares of the Registrant. There is no material relationship between the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI and/or EGOOS BVI, on one
	hand, and the Company and its affiliates or associates, on the other hand. Upon conversion of the note (the “Conversion”),
	the then existing shareholders of the Registrant collectively own an aggregate of 24.7% of the post-Acquisition entity.




	 




	On
	August 5, 2015, Yigou entered into an Exclusive Service Agreement which entitles Yigou to receive substantially all of the economic
	benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in consideration of services provided by Yigou to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
	In addition, Yigou entered into certain agreements with each of Wenbin Yang, Ping Li, (collectively, the “Guangzhou Yuzhi
	shareholders”), as well as Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, including (i) a Call Option Agreement allowing Yigou to
	acquire the shares of Guangzhou Yuzhi as permitted by PRC laws, (ii) a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides Yigou with
	the voting rights of the Guangzhou Yuzhi shareholders and those of Guangzhou Yuzhi, and (iii) an Equity Pledge Agreement that
	pledges the shares in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to Yigou. This VIE structure provides Yigou, a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of EGOOS HK, with control over the operations and benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries without having a direct equity
	ownership in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries (EGOOS BVI, EGOOS HK, Guangzhou Yuzhi, Shenzhen Exce-card, Guangzhou Rongsheng
	and Yigou are collectively referred to herein as the “Group”).

	Reverse
	Stock Split





	 




	On
	October 13, 2015, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders collectively holding approximately 70.5% of the Company’s
	outstanding common stock executed a joint written consent approving a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty (the “Reverse
	Split”). A Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation effecting the Reverse Split was filed with the Secretary
	of State of Delaware on December 1, 2015.

	Exce-card is based in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, with a business development department in New York, NY.
	Additionally, Shenzhen Exce-card has entered into a partnership agreement with UINT France located in Saint Aubin, France (“UINT”),

	In
	February 2015, Shenzhen Exce-card developed an electronic inlay utilizing innovative audio technology and embedded in a specialized
	IC card product, namely, “audio bank card.” We were granted the patent (expiring in 2023) pertaining to such audio
	bank cards inlay. The audio bank cards meet innovative product standards set forth by UnionPay, the only domestic bank card organization
	in China as well as the only interbank network in mainland China. UnionPay has authorized its logo to be displayed on the audio
	bank cards. However, it should be noted that we have no contractual agreement or arrangement with UnionPay with respect to audio
	bank cards.




	 




	We
	supply and sell electronic inlays embedded with audio chips and other modules to card manufacturers, such as Hengbao Co., Ltd.
	(“Hengbao”) and Wuhan Tianyu Information Industry Co., Ltd. (“Tianyu”), which have established relationships
	with major banks in China. As of December 31, 2015, we generated revenue in the amount of RMB150,000 (approximately $23,602.72),
	from the aforementioned sales to Tianyu.




	 





	Our
	Business Plan





	 




	We
	believe our growth in the coming years may be supported by the continuing expansion of the market for bank cards and electronic
	payment in the PRC. According to data compiled by the People’s Bank of China (the “PBOC”), by the end of 2015,
	the amount of bank cards issued in aggregate reached 5.4 billion in the PRC, with on average 3.99 cards held by each citizen.




	 




	We
	are seeking to develop and maintain long-term relationships with major card issuers in China. Since 2014, we have been actively
	communicating with China Construction Bank (“CCB”), one of China’s four major banks, in the pursuit of promoting
	new audio bank cards embedded with our inlays, which communications led to CCB’s desire to launch a pilot audio bank card
	program to be operated by its Guangdong branch offices (“CCB Guangdong”). Under this proposed program, 500,000 audio
	cards are expected to be manufactured by Tianyu, with inlays supplied by Shenzhen Exce-card, and issued and distributed by CCB
	Guangdong to some of its 25 million customers. At a meeting among Shenzhen Exce-card, Tianyu, and CCB Guangdong in Guangzhou,
	Guangdong Province, PRC held on September 24, 2015, CCB Guangdong indicated that they would report to the individual finance department
	and procurement department of CCB’s headquarters for approval to start the procurement process regarding these 500,000 audio
	bank cards. In March 2016, CCB Guangdong started testing the audio cards internally (Phase I of the pilot program), and 500,000
	audio bank cards are expected to be gradually introduced to the bank’s customers three to six months from Phase I. We also
	plan to pursue CCB’s Guangxi branch offices to promote another pilot program in the province of Guangxi, a province to the
	west of Guangdong, with a population of approximately 47 million. If these two pilot programs are launched and proved to be successful,
	CCB is expected to issue 4 million audio bank cards in various locations throughout China.




	 




	On
	April 22, 2016, Guangdong Branch (“CCB Guangdong”) of China Construction Bank, one of China’s four major banks,
	launched a pilot program to issue new audio bank cards embedded with our inlays. Under this pilot program, the audio cards with
	our inlays, once applied for by the end-users, will be issued and distributed by CCB Guangdong to its selected customers from
	its pool of 25 million customers.




	 




	On
	August 22, 2016, we announced that Guangdong Qilong Internet Technology Co., Ltd. (“Qilong”), a high technology company
	based in Guangzhou, China, and one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Shenzhen Exce-card, entered into a strategic agreement
	to jointly develop the next generation of audio bank cards within the China Union Pay network. It is expected that the end users
	of the audio bank cards to be developed under this strategic agreement will have the ability to use various services, including
	the ability to connect their savings accounts thereto, purchase items on credit, transfer among their accounts, take advantage
	of discounts on certain purchases and travel arrangements and manage their capital.




	 




	On February 15, 2017, we, through Shenzhen Exce-card, entered into a card supply agreement (the “SD
	Card Supply Agreement”) with SmartDisplayer Technology, Co. Ltd. (“SmartDisplayer”), a company incorporated under
	the law of Taiwan, Republic of China, pursuant to which SmartDisplayer agrees to supply audio bank cards in compliance with Shenzhen
	Exce-card’s specifications and the ISO 7810 standard and in amounts requested by Shenzhen Exce-card from time to time for
	a term of two years commencing from the execution date of the SD Card Supply Agreement.




	 




	Other
	than the research, development, marketing and distribution of inlays for audio bank cards, we are developing and expanding our
	product and services to other fields, which may include providing business consulting services, solutions and software products,
	and system development services to card issuing banks, third party payment entities, and other card issuing entities, and may
	also include entering into cooperation agreements with banks to issue co-branded cards in order to share annual fees and transaction
	fees generated by these co-branded cards, and developing customers and commercial users via the operation of audio payment platform.

	The
	Chinese Bank Card Market






	 





	According
	to a report published by the PBOC, in 2015, an aggregate of 5.442 billion bank cards were issued in China, an increase of 10.25%
	over 2014; national cardholding per capita was 4.39 as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016. In terms of number of cards
	in circulation, the Chinese payment cards market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% over the period 2015-2020. Respecting the
	markets outside China, 68 million UnionPay cards have been issued in over 40 countries and regions by the end of November 2016.





	The
	Chinese Contactless Bank Card Market






	 





	Audio
	bank cards enable a direct communication between bank cards and electronic devices (including telephones, cell phones, tablets,
	and computers), allowing electronic payment by bank cards. Audio bank cards can be used in swiped transactions (including point
	of sale payment and ATM deposit, withdrawal and transfer) as a regular bank card as well as transactions via electronic payment
	which, according to the Payment and Settlement System Report published by the PBOC in April 2014, is a combined market of potentially
	up to 1.85 quadrillion RMB.




	 





	Supportive
	Government Policies and Legislation in the PRC





	 




	In
	April 2005, the PBOC and other state departments jointly promulgated Certain Opinions on Promoting the Development of Bank Card
	Industry, which encouraged and promoted work emphasis of related government authorities on, among other things, meeting the demand
	and improving the varieties and functions of bank cards, promoting a fast and sound development of bank card handling market,
	enhancing the risk management of bank cards, and implementing industrial incentive policies to support the bank card industry.




	 




	On
	January 1, 2008, the National People’s Congress of China passed “the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic
	of China.” Accordingly, “the enterprise income tax on important high- and new-tech enterprises that are necessary
	to be supported by the state shall be levied at the reduced tax rate of 15%”, which applies to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
	The regular enterprise income tax rate is 25% in China.




	 




	On
	July 18, 2015, the PBOC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Finance and seven other state government
	authorities jointly issued the Guideline Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance (the “Guidelines”),
	which aim to encourage innovation and support the steady development of internet finance.




	 





	Our
	Customers





	 




	Our
	inlays and relevant technology support are expected to be sold to bank card manufacturers. Audio bank cards embedded with our
	inlays are then expected to be sold to CCB Guangdong via its pilot program. In addition, we expect to develop and maintain our
	relationships with other banks throughout China.

	Exce-card has entered into cooperation agreements on July 23, 2014 and July 7, 2014, respectively, to partner with two bank card
	manufacturers in China, Hengbao and Tianyu, both of which are publicly traded on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange and have
	established relationships with major commercial banks in China as their bank card providers, including Bank of China, Bank of
	Communications, CCB, Agricultural Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

	Additionally,
	Shenzhen Exce-card and Tianyu signed a more detailed audio bank card production preparation service agreement (the “Service
	Agreement”), according to which, from May 1, 2015 to May 1, 2016, Shenzhen Exce-card is to provide inlays for testing, technology
	and support to Tianyu for the manufacturing of the audio bank card end product, and in return, Tianyu pays RMB150,000 (approximately
	$23,630.61) for Shenzhen Exce-card’s services. Tianyu, headquartered at Huazhong University of Science and Technology Science
	Park in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is a high-tech enterprise focusing on the research and development, manufacturing,
	and sale of products and services related to data security, mobile internet, and payment services. It has an annual production
	capacity of 500 million IC cards, and an estimated annual production capacity of 10 million audio bank cards. At present, Tianyu
	is testing and digesting the technics for the lamination of audio bank cards, and thus, is manufacturing a portion of the 10,000
	beta testing audio bank cards for Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.




	 




	A
	second cooperation agreement was entered into between Shenzhen Exce-card and Tianyu on September 16, 2015, with a 10-year term,
	confirming terms of services and cooperation between the parties detailed in the Service Agreement.




	 




	Shenzhen
	Exce-card has also entered into a cooperation agreement with Hengbao on September 28, 2015, according to which, for 10 years from
	the date of this agreement, Shenzhen Exce-card is to provide inlays, technology and support to Hengbao for the manufacturing of
	the audio card end product, and in return, Hengbao pays RMB200,000 (approximately $31,507.48) for Shenzhen Exce-card’s services.
	Shenzhen Exce-card and Hengbao also agree to cooperate and develop the market application and to gradually increase the market
	shares of audio bank cards. Hengbao, headquartered in Beijing, China, with a manufacturing facility in Danyang City, Jiangsu Province,
	China, is one of the largest card manufacturers and providers in China. Hengbao has recently started to test and adjust the technics
	for the lamination of audio bank cards according to the cooperation agreement between Shenzhen Exce-card and Hengbao.




	 




	Through
	the strategic partnership with Qilong, we are exploring the possibility of selling our next generation audio bank cards to customers
	or members of Qilong, which is a joint developer of such said cards.




	 





	Change
	of Management and Directors of the Company





	 




	On
	January 6, 2015, the Board elected Ms. Mei Yang as a director and the chairman of board of directors of the Company.




	 




	On
	March 9, 2015, the Board elected Ms. Hongxiao Zhao as the director of the Company. On March 9, 2015, the Board elected Mr. Xiaoqiang
	Zuo as the director of the Company.




	 




	On
	March 9, 2015, Mr. Jianjun Xu, Mr. Mingyong Hu, Mr. Bin Zhao submitted to the Board their resignations as directors of the Company,
	which became effective on March 9, 2015.




	 




	On
	October 16, 2015, the Board elected Mr. Zuyue Xiang as CEO and director of the Company. On October 16, 2015, the Board elected
	Ms. Xinqian Zhang as Director and Secretary.




	 





	Marketing





	 




	Since
	we supply audio chips/inlays for bank cards, we have not engaged in direct advertising efforts for marketing our products to the
	mass bank card end users.




	 




	Our
	marketing strategy is to develop relationships with major banks and strategic business partners in China, starting with the pilot
	program in March of 2016 when CCB started testing internally the audio bank cards embedded with our flexible circuit board with
	the audio chips. Upon a consistent positive response from the market and relying on the success of this pilot program, we may
	seek to further develop relationships with other card issuers including banks, such as China Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank
	of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Issuance of audio bank cards by these card issuers and large
	banks may in turn encourage other smaller banks and card issuers in China to work with us and market our products to their customers.
	In addition, we are exploring co-development opportunities with non-bank businesses. On August 22, 2016, we entered into a strategic
	agreement with Qilong to jointly develop the next generation of audio bank cards within the China Union Pay network. We hope that
	we can leverage Qilong’s customer base to market the next generation of our audio bank cards.

	Pricing





	 




	At
	present, there are no similar products on the market. Taking into account the level of acceptance by the market and the negotiation
	with issuing banks, we suggest that the unit price of the audio bank cards with our inlays to be set at per unit RMB 55, approximately
	$8.65, and inlay audio chips at per unit RMB 45, approximately $7.08. Price will be adjusted downwards upon the increase of volume
	issued and the amounts of competitive offers.




	 





	Research
	and Development





	 




	Pursuant
	to the Partnership Agreement between Shenzhen Exce-card and UINT, for the period from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2016, Shenzhen
	Exce-card paid UINT €120,000 for R&D services, €20,000 of which was for developing new audio signals of new audio
	card product, €30,000 of which was for the testing of new Inlay and assisting the card manufacturers with lamination test,
	€50,000 of which was for the conception of new generation audio cards, and the last €20,000 of which was for assisting
	the card manufacturers with certification of the new audio card product. Another €60,000 was loaned to UINT to cover its
	operation costs. We plan to continue our cooperation relationship with UINT after the expiration of the Partnership Agreement,
	and plan to engage UINT for R&D and other related services for next generations of our audio card products in the future.




	 




	UINT
	currently have 12 employees for R&D. We expect to invest resources to retain more qualified employees and update our R&D
	equipment in China for our second generation audio bank cards with one chip of a combined function of audio chip and financial
	chip, and third generation audio bank cards with fingerprint sensor chips and other personalized functions.




	 





	Seasonality





	 




	We
	do not expect our operating results and operating cash flows to be subject to seasonal variations.




	 





	Employees





	 




	A
	substantial part of our employees are located in China. As of the date of this annual report, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its subsidiaries
	have 20 employees in China and 9 employees are located in the U.S. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of
	our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.




	 




	We
	are required to contribute a portion of our employees’ total salaries to the Chinese government’s social insurance
	funds, including medical insurance, unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, and a housing assistance
	fund, in accordance with relevant regulations. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are currently paying social insurance for
	all of their twenty (20) full-time employees through a third party agent. We expect the amount of contribution to the government’s
	social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations.




	 




	Insurance
	companies in China offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited
	extent in China, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with
	acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we could
	face liability from the interruption of our business.




	 





	Intellectual
	Property





	 




	Currently
	we have five valid patents that were granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C. (“SIPO”) and
	the terms of which are ten years from the dates of grant of the patent applications. The five patents relate to the audio bank
	card technology and designs and its transaction system, such as the design of the circuit board embedded in the audio card, the
	transaction platform processing the audio data and the design of the audio chip. Two of the five patents were granted on May 4,
	2016 and the rest were granted respectively on January 22, 2014, September 9, 2015 and December 23, 2015. We obtained one trademark
	of the Company’s logo from SIPO on August 21, 2016, which remains valid until August 20, 2026. In addition, we have two
	other pending trademark applications in P.R.C. On April 23, 2015, the Company through one of its subsidiaries obtained the copyright
	on its software of Zhuozhi Changtian bank audio card application for micro and small businesses

	Pursuant
	to the Partnership Agreement, any background information and know-how used in connection with the agreement remain the property
	of the party introducing such background information. UINT’s know-how relating to the services it provides under this agreement
	remains the exclusive property of UINT and it may use such know-how for other clients. Additionally, the costs and rights of any
	patent related to the new audio bank card product arises during the Term are borne by and shared equally by both parties.




	 





	Government
	Approval and Regulation





	 




	We
	believe that we have been compliant to date with all requirements required by the applicable governing authorities in China for
	the research, development, production and distribution of audio bank cards embedded with our inlays, and that such laws, rules
	and regulations do not currently have a material impact on our operations. However, it is possible that more stringent rules or
	regulations could be adopted, which may increase our operating costs and expenses.




	 




	Additionally,
	since 1997, the PBOC has issued several versions of Financial IC Card Specifications. On November 3, 2014, PBOC published a Notice
	on Further Application of Financial IC Card, proposing a time frame, i.e., from April 1, 2015, new financial IC cards issued by
	any issuing banks should comply with the PBOC Financial IC Card Specifications version 3.0. We believe that we are in compliance
	with these requirements by the PBOC.




	 





	Competition





	 




	We
	currently are not aware of any other companies in or outside of China which is producing or marketing the similar products as
	our audio bank cards.




	 




	However,
	upon the introduction of our products and technology into the market, our potential competitors worldwide may include NagraID
	Security SA, a Switzerland-based technology and security services supplier for governments, enterprises, the banking industry
	and online electronic transactions; SmartPlayer Technology Co., Ltd., a Taiwan-based developer of viable display module for smart
	card applications; Suzhou HierStar System Limited, a PRC-based company that focuses on display cards embedded with one-time password
	(OTP) and public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies; and UINT.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	As
	reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $16,576,102
	and working capital deficit of current liabilities exceeding current assets by $838,559 due to the substantial losses in operation
	in previous periods. Management’s plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to
	raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal
	compensation. If we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources,
	such as loans or advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable
	terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its
	needs in the long term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations,
	in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require
	additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely. The accompanying financial
	statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
	of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	ITEM
	1A. RISK FACTORS





	 





	Our
	business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below and you should
	take these risks into account in making a decision to invest in our common Stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs,
	we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be seriously
	harmed. In that case, the market price of our common Stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in
	our common Stock.






	 






	Risks
	Related to the Business and Operations of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries





	 





	Risks
	Related to the Overall Business of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries





	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate their financial position and
	future success.





	 




	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries have had a limited prior operating history by which to evaluate the likelihood of success or their
	ability to continue as a going concern. Although Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries have been developing technology for and
	producing inlays for audio bank cards, and are participating in a pilot program with CCB Guangdong, there is no assurance our
	production capacity and sales will keep increasing in a profitable manner.




	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries heavily depend on sales of one key product, namely, inlays for audio bank cards.






	 





	Since
	the beginning of 2017, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries began generating revenue from the sales of inlays for audio bank cards,
	and are expected to derive a significant portion of their future revenue from such sales.




	 




	Audio
	bank cards embedded with our inlays are sold in the People’s Republic of China as a new generation of bank cards, seeking
	to substitute the traditional magnetic stripe bank cards. Because we have a very limited sales history of the inlays of our bank
	audio cards, it is difficult for us to estimate the market and sales of our products. Demand for audio bank cards may not meet
	our expectation if audio bank cards do not gain broad market acceptance and build consumer confidence in their quality, security
	and availability, or if the technology in audio bank cards is replaced by a more innovative alternate, our prospects will be negatively
	impacted.




	 





	The
	results of operations, financial position and business outlook of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries will be highly dependent
	on the market’s response.





	 




	Although
	the audio bank card meets the international standards such as those established by Mastercard for active smart bank cards and
	the innovative product standards set forth by UnionPay, CCB will only be testing the market’s response in Guangdong Province,
	China with the first 500,000 cards. In addition, bank cards with IC chips have just been popularized in China since January 1,
	2015. The market may not respond immediately to another new bank card technology. Further, the market may perceive the traditional
	cash payment method or the cardless payment method (e.g., mobile wallet) to be more convenient or secured. If the market does
	not respond to the product as quickly or does not accept the product as widely as expected, the results of operations, financial
	position and business outlook of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries will be negatively affected.




	 





	The
	results of operations, financial position and business outlook of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries will be highly dependent
	on Shenzhen Exce-card being and remaining the exclusive distributor of audio chips and audio bank card products in the Greater
	China Area.






	 





	According
	to the Partnership Agreement with UINT, Shenzhen Exce-card will be the exclusive distributor in the Greater China Area for five
	years from the date on which the first audio bank card is officially deployed by any commercial banks in China, and to keep its
	exclusivity status, Shenzhen Exec-card has to order 1 million audio card products from UINT annually. In the event that Shenzhen
	Exce-card does not meet this annual quota, it will lose its status of exclusive distributor in the Greater China Area, which may
	have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and business outlook.




	 









	 



	9



	 







	 




	 




	EGOOS
	BVI is a holding company and there are significant limitations on its ability to receive distributions from its subsidiaries.





	 




	EGOOS
	BVI conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries and through contractual arrangements with Guangzhou Yuzhi,
	an affiliated variable interest entity (“VIE”) and Guangzhou Yuzhi’s subsidiaries Shenzhen Exce-card and Guangzhou
	Rongsheng, and is dependent on dividends and other intercompany transfers of funds from its subsidiaries and affiliated VIE to
	meet its financial obligations. EGOOS BVI’s subsidiaries have not made significant distributions to it and may not have
	funds legally available for dividends or distributions in the future. In addition, EGOOS BVI may enter into credit or other agreements
	that would contractually restrict its subsidiaries or affiliated VIE from paying dividends or making distributions. Any inability
	of EGOOS BVI to receive funds from its subsidiaries including Guangzhou Yuzhi can be expected to impair its ability to pay dividends
	on the Common Stock and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our future operating or growth prospects.




	 





	The
	research and development of audio chip/inlay is entirely dependent on the partnership relationship between Guangzhou Yuzhi and
	UINT.






	 





	Shenzhen
	Exce-card engaged UINT pursuant to the Partnership Agreement with a term from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2016 to research and develop
	audio bank card technology. Although Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries intend to continue to cooperate with UINT, and to eventually
	acquire UINT, there is no assurance that the merger transaction will be consummated, or that UINT will continue to develop any
	audio bank card technology for Guangzhou Yuzhi. In addition, pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the know-how relating to the
	services provided by UINT will remain the exclusive property of UINT, and UINT may use such know-how for its other clients. Competitors
	of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries may engage UINT to develop new technology and potentially compete with the audio bank
	card product of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries. Any such incidents may harm the financial condition, results of operations
	and future growth prospects of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.




	 





	We
	depend on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing of a substantial portion of our products, which subjects the Company to
	risks, including unanticipated increases in expenses, decreases in revenues and disruptions in the supply chain.






	 




	We are
	dependent on SmartDisplayer”), a third-party supplier, for the manufacturing of all bank audio cards as of the date of this
	report. Currently, we rely on the testing workshop in Shenzhen, China and the operations of UINT in Limoges, France to manufacture
	inlays, a type of key components of our audio bank cards. We only have commercial contracts with UINT and SmartDisplayer. Our ability
	to select reliable suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products will impact our success in meeting customer demand.
	Any inability of our suppliers to timely deliver products that meet our specifications or any unanticipated changes in suppliers
	could be disruptive and costly to the Company.


	 


	Shenzhen
	Exce-card leases the workshop from Shenzhen Tianshi Qiancheng Co., Ltd. (“Shenzhen Tianshi Qiancheng”) to manufacture
	the inlays on a small scale and owns the furniture, equipment and relating properties in the workshop. We anticipate that our
	manufacturing capacity might be negatively affected or disrupted if the lease agreement with Shenzhen Tianshi Qiancheng is terminated
	unexpectedly and a new lease for a similar space with appropriate accommodations at a reasonable price is not available in a timely
	manner or at all.



	 




	A
	significant portion of EGOOS BVI’s revenues are derived from the sale of inlays for audio bank cards, the manufacture of
	some of which is in Limoges, France. Although the Company and its Subsidiaries plan to expand the testing workshop to a full-service
	factory in China in the near future, we cannot assure that we will be successful on constructing such a factory to produce the
	inlays or the bank audio cards in a timely and cost-efficient manner.




	 




	Manufacturing
	operations, both domestic and international, are subject to inherent risks, all of which could have a material adverse effect
	on its financial condition or results of operations. Risks affecting operations include:




	 






	 




	●




	unexpected
	changes in regulatory requirements;






	 






	 




	●




	political
	and economic instability;






	 











	 



	10



	 







	 





	 






	 




	●




	terrorism
	and civil unrest;






	 






	 




	●




	equipment
	and machinery breakdowns;






	 






	 




	●




	injuries
	or accidents at our facilities






	 






	 




	●




	severe
	weather or other natural disasters;






	 






	 




	●




	work
	stoppages or strikes;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	currency
	fluctuations;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	difficulties
	in staffing and managing operations; and






	 






	 




	●




	variations
	in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers.






	 




	Some
	of these hazards may cause severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment or environmental damages, and may result
	in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Any such delay or disruption can be expected to
	harm EGOOS BVI’s financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.




	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries have not entered into and may not be able to enter into any enforceable agreement with CCB in connection
	with the pilot program in which CCB will distribute 500,000 of audio bank cards with our inlays.






	 





	Although
	Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries have negotiated with CCB and have obtained an oral agreement from CCB Guangdong for CCB to
	issue 500,000 audio bank cards with our inlays through its Guangdong branches, and CCB has started an internal testing since March
	2016, in the event that CCB partially or completely fails to implement the rest of the pilot program, such oral agreement is not
	enforceable against CCB or CCB Guangdong. Moreover, there is no assurance that an enforceable agreement in writing between CCB
	and Guangzhou Yuzhi or its Subsidiaries will be entered into regarding this pilot program. Our future operating results and financial
	condition could be significantly disrupted if the pilot program is not implemented as planned.




	 





	In
	the near future, the distribution of audio bank cards embedded with our inlays may be entirely dependent on one pilot program
	of the Guangdong branches of CCB in China.






	 





	In
	the near future, CCB may remain the only distributor of the audio bank cards with our inlays in China. In the event that the CCB’s
	pilot program in Guangdong Province, China fails to gain positive market response as expected, CCB may elect to discontinue the
	distribution of audio bank card products. Although Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are actively developing relationships
	with other potential issuers and other major banks in China for the distribution of the audio bank cards with our inlays, there
	is no assurance such efforts will be successful or will result in steady income cash flow for the Company. Therefore, the financial
	condition, results of operations and future growth prospects may be materially negatively affected in the event that CCB discontinues
	the distribution of the audio bank cards with our inlays.




	 





	Currently,
	our revenues are primarily dependent on two customers that are engaged in the mass production of audio bank cards.






	 





	We
	cooperate with our two customers, Hengbao and Tianyu, based on cooperation agreements with each of them, and there is no assurance
	that these agreements will not be terminated earlier, and Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries may not be able to secure orders
	from other card manufacturers. Any such incidents may harm the financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects
	of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.




	 









	 



	11



	 







	 




	 




	Gross
	margins are principally dependent on the spread between development and production cost and sale price. If the cost of development
	and production increases and sale price does not increase or if the sale price decreases and the cost of development and production
	does not decrease, gross margins will decrease and EGOOS BVI’s results of operations could be harmed should the sales volume
	of the product does not increase.






	 





	EGOOS
	BVI’s gross margins depend principally on the spread between development and production cost and sale price.




	 




	While
	moving the production from France to China could potentially decrease the cost of production, the sale price of audio chips/inlays
	may decrease as well, as potential competitors start developing and producing like products, which may narrow the gross margins
	should the sales volume does not increase. Any event that tends to negatively impact the sales volume of audio chips of Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries will potentially harm its financial condition and results of operation.




	 





	Consumer
	acceptance or rejection of audio bank cards will have a material impact on EGOOS BVI’s future prospects.





	 




	The
	market in China for audio bank cards has not developed. Therefore, widespread acceptance of audio bank cards is not assured and
	depends on market acceptance of audio bank cards as an addition, or an alternative, to traditional bank cards or other channels
	to bank or make payment. Because this market is new, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate. In addition,
	a long-term customer base has not been adequately defined. The success of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in generating revenue
	in this emerging market will depend, among other things, on its ability to educate potential customers and end-users about the
	practical benefits of audio bank cards. In the event a substantial market for audio bank cards fails to materialize, or if we
	fail to properly capitalize on such market, our growth and future operating prospects will be materially harmed.




	 





	Unanticipated
	problems or delays with product quality or product performance could result in a decrease in customers and revenue, unexpected
	expenses and loss of market share.





	 




	EGOOS
	BVI’s cash flow depends on the timely and economical operations of and its partnership with the R&D and production centers
	in France, and potentially other production facilities in China.




	 




	The
	development and production of audio chips are complex, and the audio chips must meet detailed quality requirements in order to
	ensure the safety and efficiency of use. Concerns about audio chips quality may impact the ability of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its
	Subsidiaries to successfully market their audio chips and audio bank cards embedded with our inlays to a larger market. If the
	product does not meet its promised and marketed quality standards, its credibility and the market acceptance and sales volume
	could be negatively affected. In addition, actual or perceived problems with protection of user’s information in the industry
	generally may lead to a lack of consumer confidence in bank cards encrypted with chips of new technology. Prolonged problems may
	threaten the commercial viability of audio bank cards generally or the production and sale of the product specifically.




	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries plan to primarily sell their audio chips/inlays and relevant technology to card manufacturers, which
	are expected to sell audio bank cards through banks in China and if their relationships with one or more of these card manufacturers
	or banks were to end, their operating results could be harmed.





	 




	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are expected to market and distribute a substantial portion of its audio chips/inlays and relevant
	technology to card manufacturers, which are expected to sell audio bank cards through major banks in China. Their future operating
	results and financial condition could be significantly disrupted by the loss of one or more of these card manufacturers or banks
	with current or future relationships, order cancellations or the failure of the card manufacturers or banks to successfully sell
	the products.

	Financial
	instability in the Chinese financial markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.





	 




	The
	Chinese financial markets and the Chinese economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries, including
	other Asian emerging countries and the United States. Financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and elsewhere in the world in recent years
	has affected the Chinese economy. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investors’ reactions to developments
	in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies operating in other countries, including China. A loss in
	investor confidence in the financial systems of other countries may cause increased volatility in Chinese financial markets and,
	indirectly, in the Chinese economy in general. Financial disruptions could harm Guangzhou Yuzhi’s operation or its stock
	price, results of operations and financial condition.




	 





	Natural
	calamities could have a negative impact on the Chinese economy and harm the business of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.





	 




	China
	has experienced natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and a tsunami in recent years. The extent and severity
	of these natural disasters determines their impact on the economies in the local communities that experience these calamities.
	Natural disasters could have an adverse impact on the economies in the geographic regions in which Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries
	operate, which could adversely affect their operating and growth prospects.




	 





	Growth
	may impose a significant burden on the administrative and operational resources of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries which,
	if not effectively managed, could impair their growth.





	 




	The
	strategy of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries envisions a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on their
	administrative and operational resources. The growth of their business will require significant investments of capital and management’s
	close attention. Their ability to effectively manage their growth will require them to substantially expand the capabilities of
	their administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management, technicians and
	other personnel. Failure to successfully manage their growth could result in their sales not increasing commensurately with capital
	investments. If Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are unable to successfully manage their growth, they may be unable to achieve
	their growth goals.




	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries may be unable to protect their intellectual property, which could negatively affect its ability to
	compete.





	 




	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries rely on a combination of patent, registered trademark, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual
	restrictions on disclosure to protect their intellectual property rights. They also enter into confidentiality agreements with
	their employees, consultants, and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of their confidential information.
	These measures may not preclude the disclosure of their confidential or proprietary information. Despite efforts to protect their
	proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use their proprietary technologies and information.
	Monitoring unauthorized use of confidential information is difficult, and Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries cannot be certain
	that the steps they takes to prevent unauthorized use of its proprietary technologies and confidential information, particularly
	in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S., will be effective. Failure to
	protect our intellectual property rights can be expected to have a material, adverse impact on our competitive advantage and potentially
	on our financial condition, stock price and future growth prospects.




	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries will be required to hire and retain skilled technical and managerial personnel.





	 




	Personnel
	qualified to continue researching and developing, and to operate and manage production center and other facilities are in demand.
	The success of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries depends in large part on their ability to attract, train, motivate and retain
	qualified management and highly-skilled employees, particularly managerial, technical, sales and marketing personnel, technicians,
	and other critical personnel. Any failure to attract and retain such personnel may have a negative impact on the operations of
	Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, which would have a negative impact on revenues.




	 









	 



	13



	 







	 




	 




	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are dependent upon their officers and directors for management and direction and the loss of any of
	these persons could adversely affect their operations and results.





	 




	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are dependent upon their officers and directors for implementation and execution of their business
	plan. The loss of any of their officers or directors could have a material adverse effect upon their results of operations and
	financial position. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries do not maintain “key person” life insurance for any of their
	officers. The loss of any of their officers or directors could delay or prevent the achievement of their business objectives.




	 





	EGOOS
	BVI’s lack of business diversification could result in the devaluation of its securities if it does not generate revenue
	from its primary products, or such revenues decrease.





	 




	The
	current business of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries consists solely of the research and development, production and sale
	of audio chips in China. Currently, sales of the products account for almost 100% of EGOOS BVI’s revenues. The lack of business
	diversification could cause you to lose all or some of your investment, since EGOOS BVI does not have any other lines of business
	or alternative revenue sources.




	 





	Failure
	to fully comply with PRC labor laws, including laws relating to social insurance, may expose Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries
	to potential liability and increased costs.





	 




	Companies
	operating in China must comply with a variety of labor laws, including certain pension, health insurance, unemployment insurance
	and other welfare-oriented payment obligations. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are currently paying social insurance for
	all of their twenty full-time employees through a third party agent. If the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that payment
	of social insurance through a third party agent is invalid, the failure to comply may be in violation of applicable PRC labor
	laws and we cannot assure you that PRC governmental authorities will not impose penalties on Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries
	therefor, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Guangzhou Yuzhi and
	its Subsidiaries.




	 




	In
	addition, the new PRC Labor Contract Law took effect January 1, 2008 and governs standard terms and conditions for employment,
	including termination and lay-off rights, contract requirements, compensation levels and consultation with labor unions, among
	other topics. In addition, the law limits non-competition agreements with senior management and other employees who have access
	to confidential information to two years and imposes restrictions or geographical limits. This new labor contract law will increase
	the labor costs of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, which could adversely impact the results of operations.




	 





	EGOOS
	BVI may have difficulty establishing adequate management, governance, legal and financial controls in the PRC.





	 




	The
	PRC historically has been deficient in western style management, governance and financial reporting concepts and practices, as
	well as in modern banking and other control systems. Our current management has little experience with western style management,
	governance and financial reporting concepts and practices, and we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number
	of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, and especially given that we expect to be a publicly
	listed company in the U.S. and subject to regulation as such, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, governance
	legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records
	and instituting business practices that meet western standards. We may have difficulty establishing adequate management, governance,
	legal and financial controls in the PRC. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate
	internal controls as required under applicable U.S. laws, rules and regulations. This may result in significant deficiencies or
	material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from
	complying with SEC rules and regulations. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse
	effect on our business and the public announcement of such deficiencies could adversely impact our stock price.




	 









	 



	14



	 







	 




	 




	The
	Company has not yet developed comprehensive independent corporate governance.





	 




	Although
	the Company has formed audit, compensation and nominating committees of its board of directors, it is inexperienced in formal
	U.S. corporate governance procedures. A lack of functioning independent controls over the Company’s corporate affairs may
	result in potential or actual conflicts of interest between controlling shareholders and other shareholders. It presently has
	no policy to resolve such conflicts. The absence of customary standards of corporate governance may leave its shareholders without
	protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest, if any, and similar matters and any potential investors
	may be reluctant to provide the Company with funds necessary to expand its operations.




	 






	Although
	our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we must raise additional capital to fund our operations
	in order to continue as a going concern.






	 




	WWC,
	P.C., our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, has included an
	explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
	December 31, 2016, indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
	going concern. If we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative
	sources, such as loans or advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available
	on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient
	to meet its needs in the long term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions
	on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.
	If we require additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely, which
	could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.




	 





	Risks
	Related to the VIE Agreements





	 





	The
	PRC government may determine that the VIE Agreements are not in compliance with applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations.





	 




	EGOOS
	BVI manages and operates the business of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries through Yigou pursuant to the rights it holds under
	the VIE Agreements. Almost all economic benefits and risks arising from the operations of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries
	are transferred to EGOOS BVI under these agreements.




	 




	There
	are risks involved with the operation of the business of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in reliance on the VIE Agreements,
	including the risk that the VIE Agreements may be determined by PRC regulators or courts to be unenforceable. If the VIE Agreements
	were for any reason determined to be in breach of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities
	would have broad discretion in dealing with such breach, including:




	 






	 




	●




	imposing
	economic penalties;






	 






	 




	●




	discontinuing
	or restricting the operations of Yigou or Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries;






	 






	 




	●




	imposing
	conditions or requirements in respect of the VIE Agreements with which the Group may not be able to comply;






	 






	 




	●




	requiring
	EGOOS BVI to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;






	 






	 




	●




	taking
	other regulatory or enforcement actions that could adversely affect its business; and






	 






	 




	●




	revoking
	the business licenses or certificates of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries and/or voiding the VIE Agreements.






	 




	Any
	of these actions could adversely affect EGOOS BVI’s ability to manage, operate and gain the financial benefits of Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, which represents its sole operations, which would have a material adverse impact on its business,
	financial condition and results of operations.




	 









	 



	15



	 







	 




	 




	EGOOS
	BVI’s ability to manage and operate Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries under the VIE Agreements may not be as effective
	as direct ownership.





	 




	EGOOS
	BVI’s plans for future growth are based substantially on growing the operations of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
	However, the VIE Agreements may not be as effective in providing EGOOS BVI with control over Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries
	as direct ownership. Under the current VIE arrangements, as a legal matter, if Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries fail to perform
	their obligations, EGOOS BVI may have to (i) incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and (ii) rely
	on legal remedies under PRC law, which it cannot be sure would be effective. Therefore, if EGOOS BVI is unable to effectively
	control Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, it may have an adverse effect on its ability to achieve its business objectives
	and grow its revenues.




	 





	Risks
	Related to Doing Business in the PRC





	 





	The
	Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries must conduct their
	business activities.





	 




	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are dependent on its relationship with the local government in Guangdong province where they operate.
	The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese
	economy through regulation and state ownership. The ability of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to operate in China may be
	harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights,
	property and other matters. The central or local governments of the PRC may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations
	of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries’
	part to ensure compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any
	decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy, or regional or
	local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or
	particular regions thereof, and could require EGOOS BVI to divest itself of any interest it then holds in Chinese properties.




	 




	Future
	inflation in China may inhibit the ability of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to conduct business in China. In recent years,
	the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. Rapid economic growth can lead to
	growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for the products of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries rise at a
	rate or unchanged or even decrease so that they are insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of development and production,
	it may have an adverse effect on profitability. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to
	time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation.
	High inflation may in the future cause Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action
	which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for audio chips and audio bank cards products.




	 





	The
	operations and assets of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties
	and EGOOS BVI may lose all of their assets and operations if the Chinese government alters its policies to further restrict foreign
	participation in business operating in the PRC.





	 




	Changes
	in PRC laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion,
	imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could
	have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of. Under its current leadership,
	the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activities and greater economic
	decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the Chinese government will continue to pursue these policies, or that
	it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. EGOOS BVI may lose all of its assets and operations
	if the Chinese government alters its policies to further restrict foreign participation in business operating in the PRC.




	  









	 



	16



	 







	 




	 




	EGOOS
	BVI derives all of its sales in China and a slowdown or other adverse development in the PRC economy may materially and adversely
	affect the customers and end-users of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, demand for their products and their business.





	 




	All
	of the sales of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are generated in China and they anticipates that sales of their audio bank
	cards and audio chips in China will continue to represent all of their total sales in the near future. Although the PRC economy
	has grown significantly in recent years, no assurances can be given that such growth will continue. The industry in which Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries is involved in the PRC is new and growing, but Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries do not know how
	sensitive this industry is to a slowdown in economic growth or other adverse changes in the PRC economy which may affect demand
	for audio chips and audio bank cards products. In addition, the Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinese
	economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting
	monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Efforts by the Chinese government
	to slow the pace of growth of the Chinese economy could result in reduced demand for biodiesel products. A slowdown in overall
	economic growth, an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC may materially reduce the
	demand for bank cards in general or audio bank cards in particular and materially and adversely affect the business, results of
	operations and future operating prospects of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.




	 





	Currency
	fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect the business of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries,
	including limiting the ability to convert Chinese Renminbi into foreign currencies and, if Chinese Renminbi were to decline in
	value, reducing EGOOS BVI’s financial results in U.S. dollar terms.





	 




	EGOOS
	BVI’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the operations of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in China use China’s
	local currency as their functional currency. Substantially all of EGOOS BVI’s revenues and expenses are in the Chinese currency,
	the Renminbi, or RMB. EGOOS BVI is subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to both of these currencies.
	For example, the value of the Renminbi depends to a large extent on Chinese government policies and China’s domestic and
	international economic and political developments, as well as supply and demand in the local market. Since 1994, the official
	exchange rate for the conversion of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar had generally been stable and the Renminbi had appreciated
	slightly against the U.S. dollar. In July 2005, the Chinese government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi
	to the U.S. dollar. Under this policy, which was halted in 2008 due to the worldwide financial crisis, the Renminbi was permitted
	to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. In June 2010, the Chinese government
	announced its intention to again allow the Renminbi to fluctuate within the 2005 parameters. It is possible that the Chinese government
	could adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in more significant fluctuation of Renminbi against the
	U.S. dollar, or it could adopt a more restrictive policy. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Renminbi will remain stable
	against the U.S. dollar or any other foreign currency.




	 




	EGOOS
	BVI’s financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To
	the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the RMB, the translation of RMB-denominated transactions will result in reduced
	revenue, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against the RMB, the translation
	of RMB-denominated transactions will result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income. EGOOS BVI is also exposed
	to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it converts the financial statements of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries into U.S.
	dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in RMB exchange rates, such conversion into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation
	gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. EGOOS BVI has not entered into agreements or purchased
	instruments to hedge its exchange rate risks, although it may do so in the future. The availability and effectiveness of any hedging
	transaction may be limited and EGOOS BVI may not be able to effectively hedge its exchange rate risks.




	 







	 



	17



	 







	 





	 









	The
	State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) restrictions on currency exchange may limit EGOOS BVI’s ability
	to receive and use its funds effectively and to pay dividends.





	 




	All
	of EGOOS BVI’s sales revenue and expenses are denominated in RMB. Under PRC law, the Renminbi is currently convertible under
	the “current account,” which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not
	under the “capital account,” which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its
	Subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including distributions in the form
	of consulting fees and payments of dividends to EGOOS BVI, without the approval of SAFE, by complying with certain procedural
	requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate their ability to purchase foreign currencies
	in the future.




	 




	All
	of EGOOS BVI’s income is derived from the consulting fees it receives from Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries through
	the VIE Agreements. SAFE restrictions may delay the payment of dividends, since Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries have to comply
	with certain procedural requirements and they may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary
	to obtain and remit foreign currency for the distribution of consulting fees or payment of dividends.




	 




	Foreign
	exchange transactions by PRC operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange
	controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries borrow foreign currency through loans from EGOOS BVI or other foreign lenders, these loans must be
	registered with SAFE, and if Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries refinance by means of additional capital contributions, these
	capital contributions must be approved by certain PRC government authorities, including the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or their
	respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect the ability of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to conduct foreign
	exchange through debt or equity financing.




	 




	In
	the future, SAFE may make more restrictive policies or implement its policies in a tightened manner to control the foreign currency
	exchange. The PRC government also may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account
	transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries from obtaining foreign currency,
	they may be unable to pay dividends or meet obligations that may be incurred in the future that require payment in foreign currency.




	 





	PRC
	regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC-resident beneficial owners or our
	PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries or limit our PRC subsidiaries’
	ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits.





	 




	SAFE
	promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment
	and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced
	the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37
	requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control
	of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets
	or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special
	purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes
	with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer
	or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose
	vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited
	from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities,
	and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Moreover,
	failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for
	evasion of foreign exchange controls. According to the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange
	Administration of Direct Investment released on February 13, 2015 by SAFE, local banks will examine and handle foreign exchange
	registration for overseas direct investment, including the initial foreign exchange registration and amendment registration, under
	SAFE Circular 37 from June 1, 2015.

	The
	nationality of EGOOS BVI’s sole shareholder, Mr. Jie Yang, is the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and he resides in the PRC. We
	do not have control over our beneficial owner and our future beneficial owner(s), and cannot assure you that all of our PRC-resident
	beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules. The failure of our beneficial owners

	it is unclear how this regulation, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted,
	amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business
	operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute
	additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to our company.
	These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 





	Because
	all of EGOOS BVI’s assets are located outside of the United States and its sole director resides outside of the United States,
	and because all of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries’ officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult
	for you to enforce your rights against EGOOS BVI based on United States federal securities laws or against these persons in the
	United States or to enforce judgments of United States courts against EGOOS BVI or the officers or directors of EGOOS BVI in the
	PRC.





	 




	The
	sole director of EGOOS BVI, Mr. Jie Yang, as well as all of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries’ officers reside outside
	of the United States. Furthermore, the operating subsidiaries, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, are located in the PRC. All
	of their assets are located outside of the United States. China does not have a treaty with United States providing for the reciprocal
	recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce
	their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws against EGOOS BVI in the
	courts of either the United States or the PRC or France and, even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States,
	to enforce such judgments in the PRC courts or French courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between
	the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against EGOOS BVI or its officers and directors of criminal penalties,
	under the United States federal securities laws or otherwise.




	 





	EGOOS
	BVI may have limited legal recourse under PRC laws if disputes arise under contracts with third parties.





	 




	The
	Chinese government has enacted laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign
	investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and
	regulations is limited, and EGOOS BVI’s ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable.
	The resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government,
	and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights Guangzhou
	Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under PRC laws, in either of these cases,
	are severely limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries
	may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect
	on EGOOS BVI’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Although legislation in China has significantly
	improved the protection afforded to various forms of foreign investment and contractual arrangements in China, these laws, regulations
	and legal requirements are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties, which could limit the
	legal protection available to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries as well as foreign investors. The inability to enforce or obtain
	a remedy under any of the future agreements of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of business,
	business opportunities or capital and could have a material adverse impact on EGOOS BVI’s results of operations and future
	business prospects.




	 





	Failure
	to comply with the registration requirements for employee share option plans may subject our PRC equity incentive plan participants
	or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.





	 




	On
	February 15, 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of the SAFE on Relevant Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration
	for Domestic Individuals’ Participating in the Share Incentive Schemes of Overseas-Listed Companies, or SAFE Circular 7,
	to replace the previous Operating Procedures for Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in the Employee Stock Ownership
	Plan or Stock Option Plan of Offshore Listed Companies issued by SAFE in March 2007, also known as “SAFE Circular 8.”
	SAFE Circular 7 regulates foreign exchange matters associated with employee stock option incentives or similar incentives permitted
	under applicable laws and regulations granted to PRC residents by companies whose shares are listed on offshore stock exchanges.




	 









	 



	19



	 







	 




	 



	In
	accordance with SAFE Circular 7, all PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans of an overseas publicly-listed company
	are required, through the PRC subsidiary of the overseas publicly-listed company, to jointly entrust a PRC agent to handle foreign
	exchange registration with SAFE or its local office and complete procedures relating to the share incentive schemes such as opening
	accounts and capital transfers. PRC residents include PRC nationals or foreign citizens having been consecutively residing in
	PRC for not less than one year, acting as directors, supervisors, senior management personnel or other employees of PRC companies
	affiliated with such offshore listed company. A PRC agent can be one of the PRC subsidiaries of the offshore listed company participating
	in the share incentive scheme or another PRC institution qualified for asset trusteeship s as designated by the PRC subsidiary
	and in accordance with PRC laws. The foreign exchange proceeds received by the PRC residents from sale of shares under share incentive
	plans granted by offshore listed companies must be remitted to bank accounts in China opened by the PRC agents. Further, a Notice
	Concerning Individual Income Tax on Earnings from Employee Stock Options, jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the State
	Administration of Taxation provides that domestic companies that implement employee share option programs must file the employee
	share option plans and other relevant documents with local tax authorities having jurisdiction over the companies before implementing
	such plans, and must file share option exercise notices and other relevant documents with local tax authorities before their employees
	exercise any share options.




	 




	We
	may adopt an equity incentive plan and make numerous stock option grants under the plan to its officers, directors and employees,
	some of whom are PRC citizens and may be required to complete the relevant foreign exchange registration procedures in accordance
	with SAFE Circular 7. We plan to advise our employees to complete these procedures in connection with our future share incentive
	plans. However, we cannot assure you that registration procedures with SAFE or its local counterparts in full compliance with
	SAFE Circular 7 will be completed on a timely basis, if at all. The failure to complete these procedures may subject us or our
	PRC employees holding restricted shares or share options under our share incentive plans to fines and other legal or administrative
	sanctions.




	 





	Due
	to various restrictions under PRC laws on the distribution of dividends by PRC operating subsidiaries and VIE affiliates, EGOOS
	BVI may not be able to pay dividends to its stockholders.





	 




	The
	Wholly-Foreign Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Wholly-Foreign Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (1990),
	as amended, and the Company Law of the PRC (2006) contain the principal regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly
	foreign owned enterprises. Under these regulations, wholly foreign owned enterprises, such as Yigou, may pay dividends only out
	of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally,
	Yigou is required to set aside a certain amount of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds.
	These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital
	purposes.




	 




	Furthermore,
	if the consolidated subsidiaries incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict EGOOS
	BVI’s ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If EGOOS BVI or its consolidated subsidiaries and VIE affiliates
	are unable to receive all of the revenues from operations due to these contractual or dividend arrangements, EGOOS BVI may be
	unable to pay dividends.




	 





	EGOOS
	BVI may have difficulty establishing adequate management, governance, legal and financial controls in the PRC.





	 




	The
	PRC historically has been deficient in western style management, governance and financial reporting concepts and practices, as
	well as in modern banking, and other control systems. EGOOS BVI’s current management has little experience with western
	style management, governance and financial reporting concepts and practices, and it may have difficulty in hiring and retaining
	a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, and especially given that EGOOS BVI
	expects to be a publicly listed company in the U.S. and subject to regulation as such, it may experience difficulty in establishing
	management, governance legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account
	and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet western standards. EGOOS BVI may have difficulty establishing
	adequate management, governance, legal and financial controls in the PRC. Therefore, it may, in turn, experience difficulties
	in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under applicable U.S. laws, rules and regulations. This
	may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in its internal controls which could impact the reliability of its
	financial statements and prevent it from complying with SEC rules and regulations. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of
	compliance could have a materially adverse effect on EGOOS BVI’s business and the public announcement of such deficiencies
	could adversely impact its stock price.

	Risks
	Related to Our Common Stock





	 





	Trading
	in our common stock over the last 12 months has been very limited, so investors may not be able to sell as many of their shares
	as they want at prevailing prices.





	 




	Shares
	of our common stock are quoted on the OTCQB Market under the symbol “WAYS”. If limited trading in the Common Stock
	continues, it may be difficult for investors to sell such shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.
	Also, the sale of a large block of Common Stock could depress the market price of the Common Stock to a greater degree than a
	company that has a higher volume of trading of its securities.




	 





	An
	active and visible trading market for our Common Stock may not develop.





	 




	We
	cannot predict whether an active market for our Common Stock will develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:




	 






	 




	●




	Investors
	may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;






	 






	 




	●




	Market
	visibility for our Common Stock may be limited; and






	 






	 




	●




	A
	lack of visibility for our Common Stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for our Common Stock.






	 




	The
	OTCQB market is an over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than NASDAQ or the NYSE AMEX. The trading
	price of the Common Stock is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating
	results, changes in analysts’ earnings estimates, announcements of innovations by us or our competitors, general conditions
	in the industry in which we operate and other factors. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions,
	may have a material or adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.




	 




	The Company may be subject to the risks relating
	to penny stocks.



	 


	Trading in our common stock may,
	from time to time, be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
	rules require additional disclosure by broker–dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a “penny
	stock” and impose various sales practice requirements on broker–dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than
	established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker–dealers
	from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and
	liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined
	generally as any non–exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
	exceptions.



	 





	The
	market price for our stock may be volatile.





	 




	The
	market price for our stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:




	 






	 




	●




	actual
	or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	changes
	in financial estimates by securities research analysts;






	 






	 




	●




	announcements
	by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	addition
	or departure of key personnel;






	 






	 




	●




	fluctuations
	of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	intellectual
	property or other litigation; and






	 






	 




	●




	general
	economic or political conditions in China.






	 




	In
	addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related
	to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market
	price of our stock.




	 









	 



	21



	 







	 




	 




	Compliance
	with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our management’s inexperience with such regulations
	will result in additional expenses and creates a risk of non-compliance.





	 




	Changing
	laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated
	with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and
	financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general
	and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance
	activities. In addition, our management located in the PRC has little experience with compliance with U.S. laws (including securities
	laws). This inexperience may cause us to fall out of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which could lead to enforcement
	action against us and a negative impact on our stock price.




	 





	We
	do not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors’ sole source of gain, if
	any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.





	 




	We
	do not plan to declare or pay any cash dividends on our shares of Common Stock in the foreseeable future and currently intend
	to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, investors should not rely on an investment in our securities if
	they require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be investors’ sole
	source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, investors may not be able to resell their Common Stock at or above the price
	they paid for them.

	those certain Consulting Service Agreement, Operating Agreement, Pledge and Security Agreement, Option Agreement, and Voting Rights
	Proxy Agreement (the “VIE Agreements”) executed entered into by Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech on October 28,

	not make any payment of service fees to Fuhua Biomass, and that Ding Neng Bio-tech failed to perfect the security interest in
	the pledged stocks. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via in-court mediation directed by the Court. As a result, Fuhua Biomass

	“estimate,” “possible,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,”
	“ongoing,” “could,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential,” “intend,”
	and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
	uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include,
	but are not limited to, availability of additional equity or debt financing, changes in sales or industry trends, competition,
	retention of senior management and other key personnel, availability of materials or components, ability to make continued product
	innovations, casualty or work stoppages at our facilities, adverse results of lawsuits against us and currency exchange rates.
	Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their
	perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate.
	Readers of this report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as there can be no assurance

	Overview
	of Business





	 




	The
	Company

	i

	s a development stage in the business of design, development, and proliferation
	of next generation debit and credit cards for financial institutions employing innovative secured encryption technology transmitted
	via audio wave technology; the Company has partnered with China Construction Bank under a pilot program to develop and market
	to the end using bank customers and business operators to adopt the next generations of cards by developing point of sale and
	commercial interfaces via software and other solutions to generate demand for these cards as a value-added alternative to current
	generation debit and credit cards, and China UnionPay has authorized our Company to use its logo on these debit and credit cards.

	Critical
	Accounting Policies





	 




	We
	prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and
	apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management
	believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about
	the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions
	or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the
	preparation of our consolidated financial statements.




	 




	While
	we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our consolidated
	financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.




	 




	The
	independent accounting firm restated the accrual of franchise tax payable for the year ended December 31, 2015 and reflected the
	adjustments in the financial statements for the year of 2015. For more information of the restated financial statements of 2015,
	please refer to “Note 14 Restatement and Correction of Error” of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included
	elsewhere in this Annual Report on the form 10-k.





	 









	Results
	of Operations







	 





	We
	are a development stage company and have generated minimal revenues from operations since our inception on November 11, 2013 to
	December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $1,968,225 and total liabilities of $2,782,165. We expect we
	will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among
	other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.




	 




	We
	are in the process of developing our products and services. Consequently, we generated minimal revenues as of the date of this
	report. We have an accumulated deficit and have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect losses to continue during
	2016.




	 





	Revenue




	 




	Revenue
	was derived from a service contract for technical consulting.  We earned revenues of $30,691 for the year ended December,
	2016.



	 

	 






	Expenses






	 





	During
	the 12 months period ended December 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses and professional fees of $1,248,324.
	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred general and administrative expenses and professional fees of $1,334,076.
	General and administrative and professional fee expenses were generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative
	contracted services, such as legal and accounting, developmental costs, and marketing expenses.





	 







	LIQUIDITY
	AND CAPITAL RESOURCES





	 





	We expect to continue to
	expend cash in 2017 as we continue to expand research, development and manufacturing efforts for the audio cards and related technologies.
	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $16,590,509 and working capital deficit of current liabilities
	exceeding current assets by $860,098 due to the substantial losses in operation in previous periods. Management’s plan to
	support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings
	and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do not raise all of the
	money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans or advances from our officers,
	directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that
	any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. Even if the Company
	is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or
	cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require additional cash and cannot raise
	it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely.

	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements






	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources that is material to investors.





	 






	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	Except
	for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered
	standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature
	recognized by the FASB and applicable to our company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes
	any effect will not have a material impact on our company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

	ITEM
	9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 





	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
	13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
	in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
	the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
	and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or
	officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 









	 



	26



	 







	 




	 



	As
	of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the “Certifying
	Officers”), conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers
	have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were, due to certain factors, not effective to ensure that material
	information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by our management on a timely basis in order to comply with our disclosure
	obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.




	 




	Our
	management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.




	 




	Our
	internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:




	 






	 




	●




	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
	of the assets of the Company;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
	that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, we carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
	on the framework in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
	not effective as of December 31, 2016. Management has specifically observed that our accounting systems and current staffing resources
	in our finance department are currently insufficient to support the complexity of our financial reporting requirements. We currently
	do not have adequate staff members in our accounting and finance department who have experience or specialized training in preparing
	financial statements in the form and format required by the SEC. We have also experienced difficulty in applying complex accounting
	and financial reporting disclosure rules as required under various aspects of GAAP and SEC reporting regulations including those
	relating to accounting for business combinations, intangible assets, derivatives and income taxes.




	 




	We
	have instituted certain procedures to mitigate our internal control risks. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Controller based
	in China review and approve substantially all of our major transactions to ensure the completeness and fair presentation of our
	consolidated financial statements. We have, when needed, hired outside experts to assist us with implementing complex accounting
	principles. Management and the Board of Directors believe that the Company must allocate additional human and financial resources
	to address these matters.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.





	 




	During
	the period ended December 31, 2016, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined
	in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
	control over financial reporting.

	business and affairs of the company are managed under the direction of our board. In addition to the contact information in this
	annual report, each stockholder will be given specific information on how he/she can direct communications to the officers and
	directors of the corporation at our annual stockholders meetings. All communications from stockholders are relayed to the members
	of the board of directors.





	 






	Role
	in Risk Oversight





	 




	Our
	board of directors is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes. The board of directors receives and
	reviews periodic reports from management, auditors, legal counsel, and others, as considered appropriate regarding our company’s
	assessment of risks. The board of directors focuses on the most significant risks facing our company and our company’s general
	risk management strategy, and also ensures that risks undertaken by our company are consistent with the board’s appetite for risk.
	While the board oversees our company’s risk management, management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We
	believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that
	our board leadership structure supports this approach.

	Compliance
	with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934





	 




	Section
	16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more
	than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial statements
	of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of the our common stock
	and other equity securities, on Form 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders
	are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish our company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports
	they file.




	 




	Based
	solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us, and on written representations by our officers and directors
	regarding their compliance with the applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, we believe that,
	with respect to the period ended December 31, 2016, our officers and directors, and all of the persons known to us to own more
	than 10% of our common stock, have not filed all required reports on a timely basis. We plan to file such forms required by the
	Securities and Exchange Commission regulations as soon as practicable.

	On
	August 5, 2015, Yigou entered into an Exclusive Service Agreement which entitles Yigou to substantially all of the economic benefits
	of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in consideration of services provided by Yigou to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
	In addition, Yigou entered into certain agreements with each of Wenbin Yang and Ping Li, (collectively, the “Guangzhou Yuzhi
	shareholders”), as well as Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, including (i) a Call Option Agreement allowing Yigou to
	acquire the shares of Guangzhou Yuzhi as permitted by PRC laws, (ii) a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides Yigou with
	the voting rights of the Guangzhou Yuzhi shareholders and those of Guangzhou Yuzhi, and (iii) an Equity Pledge Agreement that
	pledges the shares in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to Yigou. This VIE structure provides Yigou, a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of EGOOS HK, with control over the operations and benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries without having a direct equity
	ownership in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.




	 





	Acquisition





	 




	A
	director and former CEO of the Company, Ms. Mei Yang, has since December 2013 worked as a vice president of Shenzhen Exce-Card,
	a wholly owned subsidiary of Guangzhou Yuzhi, which is indirectly wholly-controlled by EGOOS BVI. Ms. Yang therefore was on both
	sides of the Company’s transactions with EGOOS BVI. Ms. Yang does not hold any equity interest in EGOOS BVI or Shenzhen
	Exce-Card.




	 





	Loan
	to Management






	 





	Guangzhou
	Yuzhi extended a loan to Xiang, Zuyue, our Chief Executive Officer, in the amount of RMB 9,999,998 (approximately $1,541,956),
	which is unsecured and does not bear interest. Such referenced loan was extended to Mr. Xiang by Guangzhou Yuzhi in May 2014,
	prior to the consummation of our acquisition of EGOOS BVI (as well as Guangzhou Yuzhi) on October 19, 2015. In addition, there
	was an additional immaterial increase of the amount due from Mr. Xiang in the amount of RMB 7,918 (approximately $1,285), which
	was petty cash issued to Mr. Xiang for prepaid travel expenses.As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance of the loan is
	$1,350,714. . The Company is aware of the ramifications of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits any issuer from
	extending or maintaining any personal loans to or for any director or executive officer of the issuer, and the Company has implemented
	control procedure to prevent violation of Section 13(k) in the future, which includes, without limitation, that any loan to or
	for any director or executive officer of the Company (and any other related transaction with an aggregate amount of more than
	$100,000) will require prior written consent from the Board of Director (with interested directors, if any, excluded from voting
	on such matter).




	 





	Loans
	to the Company






	 





	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company has an outstanding balance of an aggregate of $2,522,235 owed to certain shareholders and directors
	of the Company and its Subsidiaries.




	 





	Director
	Independence





	 




	Each
	of Ms. Xinqian Zhang, Mr. PokKam Li, Ms. Hongxia Zhao, and Mr. Xiaoqiang Zuo is an “independent” directors as defined
	by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and will meet the independence standards set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act.

	REPORT
	OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 





	To:




	The Board of Directors and Stockholders
	of

	Wave
	Sync Corp.





	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wave Sync Corp. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
	these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wave
	Sync Corp. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years
	then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 11 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses in previous years and has a working capital
	deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s


	  


	plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 10. These
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 




	As
	discussed in Note 14, the accompanying 2015 consolidated financial statements have been restated.

	THE
	COMPANY AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES








	 





	Wave
	Sync Corp. formerly known as China Bio-Energy Corp. (the “Company”), and prior to that known as China INSOnline Corp.,
	was incorporated on December 23, 1988 as Lifequest Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation.




	 




	In
	June 2010, the Company ceased all operations conducted by its then subsidiaries: Ever Trend Investment Limited, Run Ze Yong Cheng
	(Beijing) Technology, San Teng Da Fei Technology, and Guang Hua Insurance Agency (“Ever Trend Group”); on January
	27, 2015, the Company announced the completion of the disposition of the aforementioned subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Company
	has excluded the accounts of Ever Trend Group in these financial statements and the accompanying notes contained herein.




	 




	On
	November 12, 2010, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Ding Neng Holdings Ltd, an investment holdings company
	incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“Ding Neng Holdings”); the share exchange agreement was amended on December
	6, 2010, whereby the Company, under the share exchange agreement and its related amendment, would have contemplated acquiring
	100% of Ding Neng Holdings in exchange for the issuance of 26,162,505 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001.
	Under the share exchange agreement, the Company would have contemplated owning and operating Ding Neng Holdings and Ding Neng
	Holdings’ directly, and indirectly held subsidiaries: Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Ding Neng HK”), Zhangzhou
	Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (“WOFE”), and Ding Neng Bio-tech. Ding Neng HK was incorporated under the
	laws of Hong Kong on September 10, 2010. Ding Neng HK did not have any operations. Ding Neng HK has been delinquent with its annual
	regulatory filings in Hong Kong, and should be considered dormant and defunct. Ding Neng HK was wholly-owned by Ding Neng Holdings.
	Zhangzhou Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (“WFOE”) was incorporated as a wholly-foreign owned entity under
	the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), on November 2, 2010. WFOE was wholly-owned by Ding Neng
	HK. Ding Neng Bio-tech was incorporated under the laws of the PRC on December 8, 2006. It was located in Zhangzhou city Fujian
	Province of PRC. Ding Neng Bio-tech was engaged in the production, refinement and distribution of bio-diesel fuel in Southern
	China. Ding Neng Bio-tech operated a biodiesel manufacturing facility in Zhangzhou city. On October 28, 2010, WFOE and Ding Neng
	Bio-tech entered into a set of variable interest entity agreements that included: (1) a Consulting Service Agreement with Ding
	Neng Bio-tech, which entitled WFOE to receive substantially all of the economic benefits of Ding Neng Bio-tech in consideration
	for services provided by WFOE to Ding Neng Bio-tech, (2) an Option Agreement with Xinfeng Nie, Sanfu Huang, and Shunlong Hu (the
	shareholders of Ding Neng Bio-tech) allowing the WFOE to acquire all the shares of Ding Neng Bio-tech as permitted by PRC laws,
	(3) a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides WFOE with the all voting rights of the Ding Neng Bio-tech shareholders, and
	(4) an Equity Pledge Agreement that pledges the shares in Ding Neng Bio-tech to WFOE (VIE Agreements). These VIE Agreements granted
	effective control of Ding Neng Bio-tech to WFOE. On June 4, 2015, WFOE filed a civil action in Haicang District People’s
	Court of Xiamen, Fujian, PRC (the “Court”) against Ding Neng Bio-tech, alleging that the purposes of those certain
	executed VIE Agreements entered into by WFOE and Ding Neng Bio-Tech on October 28, 2010, had been frustrated, and that these VIE
	Agreements should be terminated. WFOE alleged that Ding Neng Bio-Tech did not make any payment of service fees to WFOE, and that
	Ding Neng Bio-Tech failed to perfect the security interest in the pledged stocks. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via
	in-court mediation directed by the Court. As a result, WFOE and Ding Neng Bio-Tech entered into binding settlement, among other
	things, (i) to terminate the VIE Agreements, and (ii) that the litigation fee in the amount of RMB10,000 (approximately $1,610.50)
	would be borne by Ding Neng Bio-Tech. Ding Neng Holdings is delinquent with its regulatory filings and annual fees to the British
	Virgin Islands; accordingly, the Ding Neng Holdings should be considered dormant and defunct.

	2015




	(Stated in US Dollars)



	 



	Given
	that the Company has not been able to exercise effective control over Ding Neng Bio-Tech or to access Ding Neng Bio-tech’s
	financial information since 2011, and the VIE Agreements were terminated, the Company has excluded the accounts of Ding Neng Bio-Tech’s
	in these financial statements and the accompanying notes contained herein; the exclusion of such accounts is considered as a type
	two material subsequent event that occurred prior to the issuance of the financial statements but after the balance sheets dates
	that required material adjustments to the financial statements presented. Ding Neng Holdings is delinquent and defunct; the Company
	has determined that the Company was never registered as the sole shareholder of Ding Neng Holdings pursuant to the share exchange
	agreement dated November 12, 2010, and amended December 6, 2010; accordingly, the Company has excluded the accounts of Ding Neng
	and its subsidiaries in these financial statements and the accompanying notes as contained herein; the exclusion of such accounts
	is considered as a type two material subsequent event that occurred prior to the issuance of the financial statements but after
	the balance sheets dates that required material adjustments to the financial statements presented. The Company accounted for the
	issuance of shares to the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings under the contemplated share exchange transaction as a recapitalization
	of the Company under reverse take-over accounting; accordingly, the Company’s historical stockholders’ equity has
	been retroactively restated to the first period presented; as a result of the Company not being updated to Ding Neng Holdings
	shareholder register, and that Ding Neng Holdings being defunct, the Company has written off all investments made in Ding Neng
	as loss on investment in subsidiary.




	 




	In
	connection with the share exchange agreement with the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings that contemplated the acquisition of
	Ding Neng Holdings and its subsidiaries, the Company elected to adopt the fiscal year used by Ding Neng Holdings, which was a
	calendar year; accordingly, the Company’s financial statements presented herein have been, and on a go-forward basis, will
	be prepared using a December 31 year-end date, and each operating period will cover twelve full calendar months.




	 





	Share
	Purchase Agreement





	 




	On
	October 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with EGOOS
	Mobile Technology Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands holding company (“EGOOS BVI”), which owns 100% of EGOOS
	Mobile Technology Company Limited, a Hong Kong company (“EGOOS HK”), which owns 100% of Move the Purchase Consulting
	Management (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“WOFE”), a foreign investment enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC, and
	which has, through various contractual agreements known as variable interest entity (“VIE”) agreements. These VIE
	agreements provide the WOFE management control and the rights to the profits of Guangzhou Yuzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd.,
	a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC as a variable interest entity (“GZYZ”), which owns 100% of Shenzhen
	Qianhai Exce-card Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“SQEC”), which owns 100% of Guangzhou Rongsheng Information
	Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“GZRS”) and the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI. The VIE agreements include:

	of GZYZ in consideration for services provided by WOFE to GZYZ, (2) a Call Option Agreement with the shareholders of GZYZ, Yang
	Wenbin and Li Ping, allowing the WOFE to acquire all the shares of GZYZ as permitted by PRC laws, (3) a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement
	that provides WOFE with the all voting rights of the GZYZ’s shareholders, and (4) an Equity Pledge Agreement that pledges
	the shares in GZYZ to WOFE.

	Management has assessed the terms of the VIE agreements and determined that the Company is
	the primary beneficiary of those agreements based on Management’s ability to direct the use and disposition of GZYZ assets
	including the payment of future profits to the Company.  Management also determined the Company has implicitly provided financial
	support to GYZY; accordingly, Management believes that GZYZ and its subsidiaries should be consolidated as variable interest entities
	of the Company.

	2015




	(Stated in US Dollars)



	 



	On
	January 28, 2015, ownership of SQEC’s was transferred from Bao, Shanshan to Xiang, Zuyue for a consideration of approximately
	$1,629,062 (RMB 10,000,000). Simultaneously, Xiang, Zuyue transferred 40% of ownership to Li, Na for a consideration of $651,625
	(RMB 4,000,000). On July 24, 2015, SQEC entire ownership was collectively transferred from Xiang, Zuyue and Li, Na to Guangzhou
	Yuzhi Information Technology Co. Ltd. (“GZYZ”) for a consideration of approximately $1,629,062 (RMB 10,000,000).




	 




	On
	March 16, 2015, the GZRS was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SQEC. GZRS has an authorized capital of RMB 1,000,000.
	As of the date of this report, GZRS has not been capitalized.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Share Purchase Agreement the Company issued a convertible note to EGOOS BVI’s sole shareholder for 100% equity interest
	in EGOOS BVI. The note is convertible into 15,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock contingent on the following conditions:
	(i) the Company has effectuated a reverse split of all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock as of the date of the issuance
	of the note (the “Reverse Split”) and (ii) the average closing price of the common stock for 3 business days within
	any period of 10 consecutive business days exceeds $1.00 per share (the “Conversion Conditions”). Upon conversion
	of the note, the existing shareholders of the Registrant will own an aggregate of 24.7% of the post-acquisition entity. The note
	was issued at Par, it is unsecured, interest free, and is due on the second anniversary of the issuance date of the note. In accounting
	for the note, the Company has assumed that the note does not carry any discount from face that requires accretion as interest
	expense to its results of operations, including any potential beneficial conversion features. On January 26, 2016, the reverse
	split was effectuated, and subsequently, on February 4, 2016, the convertible promissory note was converted into 15 million newly
	issued shares of the Company’s common stock. The conversion of the promissory note has been recognized retroactively to
	the first period presented as a component of the reverse takeover transactions detailed below.




	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming that the Company has controlled EGOOS BVI and its intermediary holding
	companies, operating subsidiaries, and variable interest entities: EGOOS HK, WOFE, GZYZ, SQEC, and GZRS from the first period
	presented. The transactions detailed above have been accounted for as reverse takeover transactions and a recapitalization of
	the Company, including the conversion of the convertible promissory note; accordingly, the Company (the legal acquirer) is considered
	the accounting acquiree and EGOOS BVI (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. No goodwill has been recorded.
	As a result of this transaction, the Company is deemed to be a continuation of the business of EGOOS BVI and SQEC.

	D.




	Use
	of estimates






	 




	The
	preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for certain items such as allowance for doubtful accounts,
	depreciation and amortization, impairment, inventory allowance, taxes and contingencies.




	 








	E.




	Contingencies






	 




	Certain
	conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will
	only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management assesses such contingent
	liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
	proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s
	management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the
	amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND
	2015




	(Stated in US Dollars)



	 



	If
	the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
	can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment
	indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be
	estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
	and material would be disclosed.




	 




	Loss
	contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case
	the guarantee would be disclosed.




	 








	F.




	Cash
	and cash equivalents






	 




	The
	Company classifies the following instruments as cash and cash equivalents: cash on hand, unrestricted bank deposits, and all highly
	liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.




	 








	G.




	Accounts
	receivable






	 




	Trade
	receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate
	for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as incurred.




	 








	H.




	Other
	receivables






	 




	Other
	receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance
	for doubtful accounts is made when recovery of the full amount is doubtful.




	 








	I.




	Property,
	plant and equipment






	 




	Plant
	and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using
	the straight-line method with a salvage value of 10%. Estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:




	 






	 




	Computer equipment




	3 years






	 




	Office furniture




	5 years






	 




	The
	cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or
	loss is included in the statement of income. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred, whereas significant
	renewals and betterments are capitalized.




	 








	J.




	Accounting
	for the Impairment of Long-lived assets






	 




	The
	long-lived assets held by the Company are reviewed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 360-10-35, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
	Long-Lived Assets,” for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets
	may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry
	changes. Impairment is present if carrying amount of an asset is less than its undiscounted cash flows to be generated.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND
	2015




	(Stated in US Dollars)



	 



	If
	an asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market
	value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
	The Company believes no impairment has occurred to its assets during 2016.




	 








	K.




	Income
	taxes






	 




	The
	Company uses the accrual method of accounting to determine income taxes for the year. The Company has implemented FASB ASC 740
	Accounting for Income Taxes. Income tax liabilities computed according to the United States, People’s Republic of China
	(PRC), and Hong Kong tax laws provide for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consists of
	taxes currently due, plus deferred taxes, related primarily to differences arising from the recognition of expenses related to
	the depreciation of plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, and provisions for doubtful accounts between financial
	and tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences,
	which will be either taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes also are recognized
	for operating losses that are available to offset future income taxes.




	 




	A
	valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not, that the deferred tax assets will either
	expire before the Company is able to realize that tax benefit, or that future realization is uncertain.




	 








	L.




	Stock-based
	compensation






	 




	The
	Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options
	on the dates of grant. Also, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the straight-line method over the requisite
	service period.




	 




	The
	Company values stock awards using the market price on or around the date the shares were awarded and includes the amount of compensation
	as a period compensation expense over the requisite service period.




	 




	For
	the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no stock-based compensation has been recognized.




	 








	M.




	Foreign
	currency translation






	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The functional currency of the Company is the Renminbi

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND
	2015




	(Stated in US Dollars)



	 



	The
	RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions.
	No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US Dollar at the rates used in translation.




	 








	N.




	Revenue
	recognition






	 



	In accordance to FASB ASC 605-10, the Company
	will recognize product revenue net of value added tax (VAT) when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the
	goods has occurred, or when customer acceptance has been obtained, which means the significant risks and ownership have been transferred
	to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. No return allowance will be made
	for products returns as the Company has not historically experienced returns. The Company recognized service revenue upon delivery
	of service and issuance of invoices to the customer.



	 








	O.




	Cost
	of revenue






	 




	Cost
	of revenue consists primarily of raw materials, utility and supply costs consumed in the manufacturing process, manufacturing
	labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to manufacture finished goods as well as warehousing and distribution
	costs such as inbound freight charges, shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs. In the future event that the Company incurs costs of distributing products to the
	Company’s customers, those costs will be included in selling expenses.




	 








	P.




	Earnings
	per share






	 




	Basic
	earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
	earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding.
	Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share are excluded from the calculation.




	 




	Dilution
	is computed by applying the treasury stock method for options and warrants. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed
	to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used
	to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.




	 








	Q.




	Comprehensive
	loss






	 




	Comprehensive
	income (loss) is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions
	to owners. The Company presents components of comprehensive income with equal prominence to other financial statements. The Company’s
	current component of other comprehensive income is the foreign currency translation adjustment.




	 








	R.




	Subsequent
	events






	 




	The
	Company evaluates subsequent events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued.
	There are two types of subsequent events: (1) recognized, or those that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions
	that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements,
	and (2) non-recognized, or those that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance
	sheet but arose subsequent to that date.

	S.




	Recent
	accounting pronouncements






	 




	On
	January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
	Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification
	and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity’s
	accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain
	fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated
	with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.




	 




	On
	February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)”, its new standard on accounting for leases.
	ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also aligns many of the underlying
	principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB’s new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related to
	evaluating when profit can be recognized).




	 




	Furthermore,
	the ASU addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, the ASU eliminates the requirement in current
	U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase
	the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. The new model
	represents a wholesale change to lease accounting. As a result, entities will face significant implementation challenges during
	the transition period and beyond, such as those related to:




	 





	 



	●




	Applying
	judgment and estimating.





	 



	●




	Managing
	the complexities of data collection, storage, and maintenance.





	 



	●




	Enhancing
	information technology systems to ensure their ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with reporting
	requirements.





	 



	●




	Refining
	internal controls and other business processes related to leases.





	 



	●




	Determining
	whether debt covenants are likely to be affected and, if so, working with lenders to avoid violations.





	 



	●




	Addressing
	any income tax implications.






	 




	The
	new guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (e.g., calendar
	periods beginning on January 1, 2019), and interim periods therein.




	 




	On
	March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07 “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying
	the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting”, which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement
	to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an
	increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity
	method (as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence), the cost of acquiring the additional
	interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and the equity method
	would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the
	investee. The ASU further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
	an available-for-sale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which the
	investment qualifies for the equity method.




	 




	The
	guidance in the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years; early adoption is permitted for all entities. Entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively
	to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the ASU’s effective date. Additional transition
	disclosures are not required upon adoption.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND
	2015




	(Stated in US Dollars)



	 



	On
	March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
	Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”, which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and
	illustrations in the Board’s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09). The FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified by
	stakeholders, including those related to (1) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard’s principal-versus-agent
	guidance and (2) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard’s
	control principle. Among other things, the ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent
	for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. As defined in the ASU, a specified good or service
	is “a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided to the customer.” Therefore,
	for contracts involving more than one specified good or service, the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods
	or services and the agent for others.




	 




	The
	ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard (as amended by the one-year deferral and the early adoption provisions
	in ASU 2015-14). In addition, entities are required to adopt the ASU by using the same transition method they used to adopt the
	new revenue standard.




	 




	On
	March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
	Share-Based Payment Accounting”, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions
	for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding
	requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.




	 



	On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)". Stakeholders indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain
	cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash
	Flows, and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity
	in practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
	If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the
	fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same
	period. As a result, the Company has elected to early adopt this Update prospectively. As of December 31, 2016 and prior periods
	retrospective adjustments have not been applied.



	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, except for the above, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have
	a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.




	 








	T.




	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments






	 




	ASC
	825, Financial Instruments, requires that the Company discloses estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts
	reported in the balance sheets for current assets and current liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable
	estimate of fair value.




	 




	The
	Company applies the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, and establishes
	a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
	measures. For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, loan receivables and short-term bank loans,
	the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The three levels of valuation hierarchy
	are defined as follows:




	 








	●




	Level
	1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
	in active markets.










	●




	Level
	2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
	in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
	directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.










	●




	Level
	3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
	measurement.

	Deferred
	Income Tax Benefits





	 




	Deferred
	income tax benefits arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
	in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating the Company’s
	ability to recover the deferred tax assets, the management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled
	reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
	In projecting future taxable income, the Company begins with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations
	and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items
	that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are
	consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses. As of December 31, 2016,
	management was uncertain as to whether or not the Company would be able to utilize the potential deferred tax assets arising from
	net operating losses’ since the Company is not currently generating any revenue; accordingly, the Company has not recognized a
	deferred tax assets.

	EARNINGS
	PER SHARE








	 




	Basic
	loss per common share from operations attributable to the Company is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during
	the relevant period. Diluted loss per common share from continuing operations attributable to the Company is based on the weighted-average
	common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not
	have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted loss per
	common share from operations attributable to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

	GOING
	CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES







	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.



	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company
	had accumulated deficits of $

	16,590,509 and working capital
	deficit of current liabilities exceeding current assets by $860,098 due to the substantial losses in operation in previous periods.
	Management’s plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public
	and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do
	not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans or
	advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there
	can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long
	term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
	case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require additional
	cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely.



	 



	The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or
	the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	RESTATEMENT
	AND CORRECTION OF ERROR






	 


	On January 5, 2017,
	the Company concluded that the consolidated balance sheet, and related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
	income/(loss), stockholders’ equity and statements of cash flows included in Form 10-K Annual Report, dated April 13, 2016
	(the “2015 Financials”) included an over accrual of franchise tax payable for the State of Delaware. In this connection,
	the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been restated to account for the reduction of the
	previous accrued tax as a correction of error. Management considered the impact to current and past financial statements, and
	determined that a restatement was the most appropriate recognition of the adjustment so as not mislead readers of the financial
	statements regarding the current year’s result of operations.

	SUBSEQUENT
	EVENT







	 



	The Company evaluates subsequent events that
	have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. There are two types of subsequent events:
	(1) recognized, or those that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet,
	including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements, and (2) non-recognized, or those that provide
	evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date.


	 


	On January 5, 2017, the Company obtained a
	statement from the State of Delaware presenting the franchise tax payable being $0. In this respect, the Company has over accrued
	the taxes payable from previous periods that result in a material overstatement of losses. The Company has corrected this issue
	and restated the financial statements to the first period presented.



	 




	On March 17, 2017, the Company and each of the two holders (the “Noteholders”) of the Company’s
	convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) entered into a convertible note exchange agreement (the “Agreement”).
	Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company shall issue to the two noteholders an aggregate of approximately 1,106,837 shares of common
	stock (the “Common Stock”) of the Company, par value $0.001, in exchange for the Noteholders’ Convertible Notes
	in an aggregate principal amount of $2,213,673.

	In the course of doing business under this agreement, one party may furnish to the other party data, designs, drawings, tracings,
	layouts, requirements, specifications, samples, equipment, pricing, costs, yield information and other written information which
	may be confidential and proprietary to the furnishing party, and which is clearly marked as "Confidential" or "Proprietary"
	(hereinafter referred to as "Confidential Information"). Both parties agree to restrict the dissemination of Confidential
	Information to only those employees, individual contractors and advisors who must be directly involved in using the Confidential
	Information in the performance of their respective duties hereunder. Each of the parties may disclose Confidential Information
	of the other on a "need to know" basis to vendors and other third parties engaged in manufacturing activities related
	to the parties' respective products, provided that such vendors and other third parties have a written obligation to protect the
	Confidential Information in substantially the same manner as provided herein and provided that the party making such a disclosure
	gives written notice to the other party identifying each such vendor and other third party. Both parties agree to not release
	details of this Agreement or to disclose Confidential Information to any party other than those authorized above without the written
	approval of the other party. The receiving party shall promptly notify the furnishing party in writing of any unauthorized use
	or disclosure of any Confidential Information.




	 


	 


	 




	 



	9.2.




	Neither party shall have an obligation to preserve the
	confidential or proprietary nature of any Confidential Information received by such party hereunder which (i) was already known
	to the receiving party free of any obligation to keep it confidential at the time of its disclosure by the furnishing party as
	evidenced, for example, by written records prepared prior to such disclosure; (ii) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful
	act of the receiving party; (iii) is received from a third person having no direct or indirect secrecy or confidentiality obligation
	with respect to such Confidential Information; (iv) is independently developed by an employee, agent or contractor of the receiving
	party; (v) is disclosed to a third person by the furnishing party without similar restrictions on such third person's rights;
	(vi) is approved for release by written authorization of the furnishing party; or (vii) is disclosed by the receiving party pursuant
	to a valid order of a court or other governmental body or any political subdivisions thereof; provided, however, that the receiving
	party shall first have given reasonable notice to the furnishing party and shall comply with any applicable protective order or
	equivalent.

	10.1.




	Force Majeure. No Party shall be considered in default
	of performance of its obligations (exclusive of either Party's obligation of payment) under this Agreement to the extent that
	its performance is delayed or prevented by causes beyond its reasonable control, including, acts of God, civil disorders, acts
	of any civil or military authority, or judicial action.






	 





	 



	10.2.




	Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement
	be held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule or regulation of law, or public policy of
	any government, or agency of government, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall, nevertheless, remain in
	full force and effect; and no covenant, condition or provision shall be deemed dependent upon any other covenant, condition or
	provision unless so expressed herein. The parties agree to substitute for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a valid,
	lawful and enforceable provision that effectuates, to the fullest extent possible, the legal and commercial objectives of the
	invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.






	 





	 



	10.3.




	Non-Waiver. A failure of either party to exercise any
	right given to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party of any obligation hereunder, shall not constitute
	a waiver of the first party's right to exercise such a right, or to exact compliance with the terms hereof. Moreover, waiver by
	either party of a particular default by the other party shall not be deemed a continuing waiver so as to impair the aggrieved
	party's rights in respect to any subsequent default of the same or a different nature.






	 





	 



	10.4.




	Relationship of the Parties. SD and PURCHASER are independent
	contractors. Each party shall be solely responsible for determining its manner of performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
	Neither party shall, nor represent itself to be, the partner, joint venture, broker, employee, servant, agent, or legal representative
	of the other party for any purpose whatsoever. Neither party is granted any right or authority to assume or create any obligations
	or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party in any matter
	or thing whatsoever.






	 





	 



	10.5.




	Assignments. Neither Party may assign or delegate this
	Agreement or any of its rights, privileges or obligations, tasks or activities hereunder without the prior written consent of

	unreasonably withheld. Any such attempted assignment or delegation in violation
	of the foregoing shall be null and void.

	sought are expressly excluded from the foregoing provision. Any controversy concerning whether a dispute is an abatable dispute
	shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). In any arbitration hereunder, the parties shall be entitled to conduct discovery
	to the fullest extent permitted by law. The parties intend their foregoing agreement to arbitrate disputes arising hereunder
	to be valid, enforceable and irrevocable.

	which party is the prevailing party.
