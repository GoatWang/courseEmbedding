David Denton to Become CVS Caremark Chief Financial Officer | Business Wire
























































David Denton to Become CVS Caremark Chief Financial Officer




Denton replaces David Rickard who retires at year end


Laird Daniels named Controller and Chief Accounting Officer






November 05, 2009 09:16 AM Eastern Standard Time



WOONSOCKET, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CVS Caremark (NYSE: CVS) today announced the appointment of David M. 
      Denton to the new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial 
      Officer, effective January 1, 2010. Denton will succeed David Rickard 
      who announced in February of this year his intention to retire as CFO.
    


      Denton, currently CVS Caremark’s SVP, Controller and Chief Accounting 
      Officer, brings nearly twenty years of financial management experience 
      with a focus on the health care and retail drug sectors to his new 
      position. Since joining the company in 1999, he has assumed positions of 
      increasing responsibility including senior finance positions within 
      CVS/pharmacy and CVS Caremark and role of Chief Financial Officer for 
      PharmaCare, a subsidiary of CVS. The selection of Denton as EVP, Chief 
      Financial Officer caps an eight month search that included both internal 
      and external candidates.
    

      “I’m extremely pleased to announce the appointment of Dave Denton as CVS 
      Caremark’s new Chief Financial Officer,” said Tom Ryan, Chairman, 
      President and CEO. “Dave’s broad financial experience, industry 
      expertise and deep understanding of our company will make him an 
      outstanding CFO. His passion for our customer coupled with his 
      value-based leadership skills will help him excel in his new role.”
    

      Previously, Denton was a consultant with Deloitte & Touche where his 
      clients included major health care organizations. He has also held 
      management positions at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida and Health 
      Options, Inc. Dave earned his M.B.A. from the Babcock School of 
      Management at Wake Forest University and his bachelor’s degree from 
      Kansas State University.
    

      Replacing Denton in his current role of Controller and Chief Accounting 
      Officer is Laird Daniels. Daniels, who joined CVS Caremark in 1997, was 
      most recently Vice President of Finance and Retail Controller for 
      CVS/pharmacy. Daniels, a certified Public Accountant, has nearly two 
      decades of financial management experience. He is a graduate of the 
      University of Connecticut and earned an M.B.A. from the F.W. Olin 
      Graduate School of Business at Babson College.
