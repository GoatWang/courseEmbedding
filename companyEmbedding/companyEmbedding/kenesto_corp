What is Kenesto?
Kenesto is a simple cloud-based product document management system.
From its inception, Kenesto has been designed for engineers, by engineers delivering a robust solution for small and medium sized companies, especially those working in a diverse ecosystem. With our Kenesto Drive service on your PC, your CAD and other applications work directly with the cloud documents seamlessly just like your local drive, always accessing the current document. Kenesto provides the necessary tools users need to share, view, collaborate easily with external users, manage permissions, create versions and lock documents for day-to-day work.  Kenesto offers engineers and designers power, simplicity, and flexibility beyond consumer cloud storage solutions such as Dropbox and as a great alternative to expensive PDM systems.

Kenesto Auth API
 
 
 
 



Kenesto Web API provides the same RESTful API that Kenesto web app and Kenesto Drive uses. You can use it for all the same operations for manipulating folders and documents. You must first be registered with Kenesto which means you must have an account in Kenesto to use the API.
 
Authentication
Your application must use OAuth 2 to authenticate a user and obtain access tokens and refresh tokens. The authentication process has been shown separately later in this document with input and output examples.
 
Hostname
Currently, the hostname for API calls is app.kenesto.com. It may change in the future.
 
Input/Output
Kenesto uses JSON as well as XML both for request and response.
 
Errors
Kenesto returns standard HTTP status codes.
 
Authentication Example
This sample or example shows Kenesto Web API which is the REST API currently used by the Kenesto Drive™ for authentication, authorization and application operations.
Any call to the API can be done by a regular GET http request and the response can be retrieved in XML or JSON depending on the call arguments.
 
For a user to have access to Kenesto operations, two requests should be made. Access.svc is the service for authentication and authorization.
 
Step 1:
https://{kenesto hostname}/Kenesto.Web.API/Access.svc/Authenticate/{method]/{accessKey}?u={username}&p={password}
 

method: xml or json
accessKey: unique business client identifier (to identify the caller organization allowed to use the API. Ask Kenesto for your identifier).
username of the user requested to be authenticated
password of the user requested to be authenticated

 
 
The response or the output is a structure that has the details required to know if the authentication succeeded and the organizations information to which the user wants to access.
The organization identifier and the token received are used for the Login call to receive a session token that will be used for the rest of the API calls.
 
Step 2:
https://{kenesto hostname}/Kenesto.Web.API/Access.svc/Login/{method}/{organizationIdentifier}?t={accessToken}
 

method: xml or json
organizationidentifier: received from the previous call
accessToken: the token from received from pervious call.

 
The token included in the response is to be used for all subsequent API calls.

About Kenesto: Values & Goals
Kenesto is my fourth engineering start-up. Along the way I’ve learned much from customers, industry leaders and entrepreneurs from varying industries.  I have also learned that surrounding oneself with a passionate and capable team makes a world of difference.
We founded Kenesto on the principle that we wanted to help customers solve document and file problems that were never solved before. These problems can appear to be simple but, when left unsolved, contribute to a very expensive and time-consuming waste. By utilizing the new Cloud platform with Kenesto, small and medium sized engineering firms can significantly simplify their environment, thus reducing expenses. These expenses could be in the area of IT or just in your overall business processes
Kenesto is aiming to deliver simple, yet powerful options for engineers and designers to store, share, view, update versions and collaborate with CAD and other documents on the cloud.  Visibility is a primary example of a simple, yet powerful function that allows engineers to respond quickly to tasks assigned to them. For the first time, engineers have an alternative to consumer oriented cloud storage solutions giving them the ability to access and share their CAD documents with anyone, anytime, anywhere. This brings confidence to engineers and management when working with outside suppliers that their current files will not be overridden inadvertently.
I’m proud to be part of a growing team of passionate people dedicated to giving customers, partners, and vendors the very best solution and service possible.  Our value is built on earning your trust.
Trust doesn’t simply happen, it is earned.  We plan to earn your trust by establishing a “social” contract with you by adhering to a few principles that represent our core values:

Integrity
Commitment
Leading edge technology

Feel free to drop me a note anytime to let me know how we’re doing.
Mike Payne

Kenesto Business Process Automation Is UpdatedHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Kenesto Business Process Automation Is UpdatedMarketwireAugust 9, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareKenesto 2012.2's new guidance layerMoreWALTHAM, MA--(Marketwire -08/09/12)- Kenesto Corp. (www.kenesto.com) today announced that an updated release of Kenesto™, the company's cloud-based business process automation system, is now available. Kenesto delivers what managers, designers and engineers want as they develop, support and enhance products and deliver them into the market. For example, purchasing managers can easily manage complex request for quotation processes (RFQ), including all outside suppliers. Critical engineering change request (ECR) processes are tracked and monitored in the cloud. And managers who prepare bid packages can rapidly assemble and approve everything needed to win intricate bids."Reaction to our June release of Kenesto has been overwhelmingly positive," said Michael Payne, CEO, Kenesto Corp. "Since then, customers have been very helpful in building our product roadmap. With Kenesto 2012.2 we responded to many of those customer requirements in a short 60-day period by taking advantage of the cloud platform on which Kenesto is based. As compared to traditional, installed products, the cloud is an important change in the way business process automation systems are delivered. As a result, users immediately get the benefit of new releases with no effort on their part."Kenesto 2012.2 offers new capabilities designed to improve Kenesto's usability, improve manageability and encourage reuse of processes. Highlights of Kenesto 2012.2 include:A new guidance layer. Kenesto users are productive immediately without the need for extensive training or documentation. However, new users may benefit from an automated walk-through in performing their initial tasks in Kenesto. A new guidance layer in Kenesto 2012.2 makes it simple for new users to begin using the process automation system.   Process templates for commonly used business processes. A major advantage of Kenesto over legacy PLM systems is that it does not require any programming or scripting. As users develop processes, they may wish to save these processes as templates. Kenesto 2012.2 now offers a graphical way to create and edit reusable templates. A user simply outlines the process as he or she normally would using the new template editor and saves it in the cloud. Then, the user may launch a specific instance of the process to accomplish the task. This requires no programming skills while delivering the full power of Kenesto in the cloud to manage business processes.   Kenesto 2012.2 support for multiple domains in one Kenesto account. Larger enterprises may operate multiple businesses units using different names and/or Internet domains. Kenesto 2012.2 now flexibly supports these companies' needs to permit different email addresses and business identities to co-exist in the same Kenesto account.   Background upload of attachments and documents. Kenesto 2012.2 has been enhanced to upload documents and attachments to the cloud in the background, allowing a user, for example, to attach a large drawing or document to a process activity and continue working in Kenesto without having to wait for the upload to complete.
