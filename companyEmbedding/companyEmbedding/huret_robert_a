Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.

PALO ALTO, Calif. January 21, 2011 – Financial Engines (NASDAQ: FNGN) today announced the appointment of Robert Huret to its Board of Directors.  Mr. Huret will serve on both the audit and compensation committees.  The company also announced that C. Richard Kramlich, a member of the Company’s board of directors, will be retiring from the Financial Engines board effective as of the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled for May.
“Dick Kramlich has been one of the strongest believers in Financial Engines and has given me and the entire management team invaluable support and guidance over the years,” said Jeff Maggioncalda, president and CEO of Financial Engines.  “Dick’s presence on the board will be missed and I can’t thank him enough for his contribution.”
“I believe Financial Engines has changed and greatly improved the retirement outlook for American workers who otherwise would not get help,” said Dick Kramlichwho is chairman and co-founder of New Enterprise Associates, and has served on the Financial Engines board for more than 13 years.
The appointment of Mr. Huret is effective January 18, 2011.  Mr. Huret was previously on the Board from 2002 to 2009. Mr. Huret left the Financial Engines board in 2009 in accordance with his firm’s policies requiring resignation when a portfolio company files with the SEC for an initial public offering.  The Financial Engines board determined that it would benefit from Mr. Huret resuming a director position, and as his firm’s policies now permit him to return to the Financial Engines board, Mr. Huret has accepted.
“After a decade of board involvement, we have missed having Bob as part of the team,” said Maggioncalda.  “We are excited to once again benefit from Bob’s wisdom and experience.”
Mr. Huret is a co-founder and Managing Member of FTV Management Company, L.P., a private equity management company, since 1998 and is a Founding Partner of FTV Capital, a multi-stage private equity firm whose limited partners include many of the world’s foremost financial institutions. Previously, he was a senior consultant to Montgomery Securities. He has served as Senior Vice President Finance and Planning and Trust Executive Officer at the Bank of California. Mr. Huret was also Vice President of Planning and Mergers and Acquisitions at First Chicago Corporation/The First National Bank of Chicago.   Since 1990, his financial and professional emphasis has focused on technology companies that develop products and services for the financial services industry. He has served as Trustee of Cornell University and San Francisco University High School. Concurrently with his investment banking and venture capital career, he serves as the Chairman of Huret, Rothenberg & Co.  Previously, he has been Founder and Vice Chairman of Newell Associates and Founder and Director of Third Age Media.  He serves as Director of Caplin Systems Ltd., Cloudmark, Inc. and Bank of Hawaii Corporation (NYSE: BOH).

Huret, MA '69, discusses Faculty Excellence Award 





        By Dan O'Brien 
March 24, 2015

Faculty members Sam Binkley and Robert Todd have been named recipients of this year’s Judy and Bob Huret Faculty Excellence Award, which supports tenured faculty research, creative projects, and innovative pedagogies.
“My commitment to Emerson is first and foremost to the faculty,” said Emerson Trustee Judy Huret, MA ’69, who makes the generous award possible. “If we didn’t have great faculty, we wouldn’t attract great students.
“Our product, really, is to graduate students who shape the world based on their experiences at Emerson,” said Huret, a Trustee since 2001 who obtained her master’s degree from Emerson in Communication Sciences and Disorders.
Huret, vice chairperson of investment firm Huret, Rothenberg and Co., has enjoyed a successful career that has encompassed management consulting, private investing, and work in the field of communication disorders, including clinical therapy.
The Judy and Bob Huret Faculty Excellence Award is a re-imagined version of the Huret Faculty Development Award. The former award provided non-tenured faculty with funds to complete creative and scholarly work toward attaining tenure. The new award is targeted toward tenured faculty—specifically associate professors—who are working on career advancement.
“Our goal is to encourage more senior faculty to move toward full professorships, which would be more akin with other colleges,” Huret said.
Binkley, an associate professor in the Institute for Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies, who focuses on sociology and cultural studies, is using his award to write his third book, Anti-Racism as a Way of Life: Diversity and Multiculturalism as Conduct and Counter-Conduct. Based on three articles under review, the book will investigate how the questions of race, either as racism or anti-racism, create specific forms of self-inquiry.
Todd, an associate professor and associate chair in the Visual and Media Arts Department, will use his award to begin production on his feature-length film, Matter. With many award-winning short films in his portfolio, this award allows Todd to create a film that, according to Todd, “sets up analogies between the intricacies of organic life and those of complex inorganic elemental structures (such as ice, sand/stone formations, natural and man-made sources of fire, and air currents)” that will be shown on film.
“The deans and I are very grateful for Judy and Bob’s longstanding support of our faculty and their scholarship, research, and creative work,” said Michaele Whelan, chief academic officer. “We see their new award as pivotal to faculty career advancement at Emerson. The potential impact of this Faculty Excellence Award over time is transformational.”
Huret has provided generous gifts to Emerson College over the years, including funding toward the Harry L. Huret and Ellen Marr Spector Gallery in 1999. She and her husband, Bob, recently had an entry garden at the new Emerson College Los Angeles named in their honor.
Judy Huret recalls enrolling at Emerson as a graduate student in the late 1960s.
“I’ll never forget how the head of the [Communication Disorders] department sat down with me on these child-sized chairs in the Thayer Lindsley nursery to look at me eye-to-eye,” she said. “It was quintessential Emerson. It was a personalized, intimate, meaningful interaction.
“I was exposed to world-class faculty in the classroom, and my internship was of such high quality,” Huret continued. “I felt it was incredible and I wanted to make that opportunity happen for others.”
Faculty may find more information on internal grant programs through the Office of Research and Creative Scholarship website.

A First-Rate Napa Valley Bordeaux Red
On a day in Napa we won’t soon forget, we tasted at a top Pritchard Hill site, a neighbor of Screaming Eagle, and two stellar hillside vineyards on Spring and Howell Mountains. The 2013 Titus “Andronicus” topped them all. This voluptuous Bordeaux-style blend didn’t just blow us away: Of the Wine Access clients who have devoured this 2013 vintage - 36 have rated it a perfect 5 stars. Luckily Eric Titus gave us one last allocation. But when these 125 cases are gone, so is this value-stunner from Parker’s “game changer” vintage. 
We’ve known Phil Titus for 25 years, and his marine biologist brother Eric for a decade. The story of their father Lee is a piece of St. Helena folklore. Lee was drawn to Napa Valley by his North Beach-bred wife Ruth Traverso, the daughter of Italian immigrants. When Lee finally started purchasing vineyard property west of the Silverado Trail in 1968, few Napa Valley growers understood what to plant on the rocky, volcanic soils of St. Helena; his land was planted to obscure grapes like Mondeuse, Burger, and Golden Chasselas. In a farsighted decision that would pay massive dividends, Lee replaced those alpine varieties with Bordeaux grapes.
Everything changed.
Phil and Eric run Titus now, producing wines exclusively from their St. Helena vineyards. Not surprisingly, the dry and steady conditions that produced Robert Parker’s “greatest vintage in 37 years” were incredibly kind to the Bordeaux varieties planted on the Titus estate. The result is a gentle beast of a wine that has to be tasted to be believed.








Tasting Notes


2013 Titus Andronicus Proprietary Red 
 Wine Access
Dark, inky, and powerful, this voluptuous Bordeaux blend features gorgeous aromas of crushed black fruits, black cherry, graphite, and tobacco. Terrifically concentrated, dense and almost chewy in texture, the core is just packed with black fruit and mountain blueberry preserves, even as the wine remains high-toned and balanced, showing none of the Port-like characteristics that often mar Napa Cabernets of equal concentration. This is a brilliant effort from one of Napa Valley’s superstar winemakers. Drink now-2025.

Wine Growing Regions




Across the wine world, different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine.
The distinction between Old World wine regions and New World wine regions is particularly important: as a sweeping generalization, Old World regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven, while New World regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in France will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in California will likely produce wines that are more fruit-forward.
But different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes. For example, within France, Bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes, while Burgundy is associated with red wines made from the Pinot Noir grape. Use this page to find top-rated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s wine-making profile.
