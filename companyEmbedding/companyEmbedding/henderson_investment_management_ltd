Specific risksInvestment management techniques that have worked well in normal market conditions could prove ineffective or detrimental at other times.Shares can lose value rapidly, and typically involve higher risks than bonds or money market instruments. The value of your investment may fall as a result.This fund is designed to be used only as one component in several in a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consider carefully the proportion of their portfolio invested into this fund.The Fund could lose money if a counterparty with which it trades becomes unwilling or unable to meet its obligations to the Fund.Derivatives use exposes the Fund to risks different from, and potentially greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and may therefore result in additional loss, which could be significantly greater than the cost of the derivative.Changes in currency exchange rates may cause the value of your investment and any income from it to rise or fall.Measures designed to reduce the impact of certain risks may not be available or may be ineffective.The Fund's value may fall where it has concentrated exposure to a particular industry that is heavily affected by an adverse event.Any security could become hard to value or to sell at a desired time and price, increasing the risk of investment losses. Find a fundSearch our funds and trusts. LiteratureSearch our literature library.Financial professionals websiteContact usYou can reach us in a variety of ways.AnnouncementsImportant message
