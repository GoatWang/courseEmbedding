GoGo Baby, Inc.




Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)
June 30, 2016





NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



GoGo Baby, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on February 22, 2013 under the
laws of the State of Delaware to enter into the toy industry. The GoGo Baby
invention of a wireless car seat toy system was created with the objective to
provide a car seat toy system that the driver can activate from the steering
wheel. It is Gogo Baby's first objective to sell the patent to a major company
or secondly have the toy manufactured, set up an online store and market the
product.

The Company's activities to date have been limited to organization and capital.
The Company's fiscal year end is December 31.



NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN



Future issuances of the Company's equity or debt securities will be required in
order for the Company to continue to finance its operations and continue as a
going concern. The Company's present revenues are insufficient to meet operating
expenses. The financial statement of the Company have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among
other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of
$54,005 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated
operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company's ability to
raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is
unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of
the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately,
to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to
continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may
result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

Since inception the Company received cash totaling $42,000 from Malcolm Hargrave
in the form of a promissory note. As of June 30, 2016, the amount due to Malcolm

OVERVIEW



Gogo Baby, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on February 22, 2013. As of
June 30, 2016 the Company had a cash balance of $194. GoGo Baby may raise
additional capital either through debt or equity. No assurances can be given
that such efforts will be successful.


Pursuant to a recent registration statement on Form S-1, DTH International
Corporation, a shareholder of Gogo Baby Inc., has distributed to its
shareholders 1,000,000 shares of its GoGo Baby common stock. The distribution
was made to holders of record of DTH International Corporation common stock as
of the close of business on December 31, 2013, on the basis of one share of GoGo
Baby's common stock for each one share of DTH International Corporation common
stock held. The 1,000,000 shares of the common stock distributed to DTH
International Corporation shareholders represent 2.7% of all the issued and
outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. DTH International
Corporation acquired 1,500,000 shares of the common stock of GoGo Baby on
November 14, 2013, for $1,000. After the distribution, a shareholder of GoGo
Baby controls 95% of the outstanding common stock.


The Company plans to attempt to raise additional equity capital by making an
equity offering to its new shareholders as soon as possible. New shareholders
are the DTH International Corporation shareholders who were shareholders on
December 31, 2013.

BUSINESS PLAN



GoGo Baby, Inc. was incorporated to create toys for small children which attach
to car seats to amuse and entertain children while riding in a car.


Our proposed product allows the driver to wirelessly control entertainment toys
attached to infant and child car seats located behind the driver, therefore
allowing the driver to maintain attention on driving and avoiding distractions
caused by turning toys on while driving.


The Company has two operating objectives to its business plan.



OPERATING OBJECTIVE ONE



Our primary Operating Objective is to produce a prototype to sell or license to
a large producer of either children's car seats or toys. In order to do this the
Company must:


*    Phase 1. Produce a viable prototype to demonstrate to the potential
car seat/toy manufacturers. The prototype will be designed and built
by Mr. Hargrave. More that one prototype may need to be built before a
satisfactory design is developed. A prototype can require up to a
month to design and build with additional time expended for testing.
Material to build the prototype is estimated at less than $100.


*    Phase 2. Contact a group of companies which could be potential
purchasers' or licensees. The Company will develop a list of potential
companies and will contact then by letter and telephone.


*    Phase 3. Make presentations to these companies.


To date the Company has built two prototypes and tested them. These are
engineering prototypes and are not manufacturing models. The Company is working
on additional prototypes which may be of sufficient viability to show to
potential car seat/toy manufacturers who may purchase the product or concept.
The Company believes it has sufficient capital resources the carry out Operating
Objective One, however development cannot always to assured. The Company may
face engineering or financial problems which it may not be able to overcome.


If we are unsuccessful at selling or licensing our product, then we may consider
our second Operating Objective described below.



OPERATING OBJECTIVE TWO



If Operating Objective One is not successful the Company may consider direct
sales of the product on the internet. This would entail a large expense and the
Company might not be able to raise the required capital. At this time the
requirements are unknown and will be known only when this is considered.


8





At the present time the Company is not expending time or money on Operating
Objective Two and will not do so in the near future. It will be expending all
its efforts on Operating Objective One.





RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



We have generated no revenue since inception and have incurred $1,000 research
and development expenses through June 30, 2016. From inception date to June 30,
2016 the Company has a net loss of $54,005.


The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the
period from the date of incorporation through June 30, 2016.






Balance Sheet Data:            6/30/2016
-------------------            ---------

Cash                           $    194
Total assets                   $    199
Total liabilities              $ 49,699
Shareholders' deficit          $(49,500)









THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015



For the three months ended June 30, 2016 we generated no revenues and had $4,520
in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $415 in interest expense,
for a net loss of $4,935.


For the three months ended June 30, 2015 we generated no revenues and had $4,376
in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $300 in interest expense,
for a net loss of $4,676.



SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015



For the six months ended June 30, 2016 we generated no revenues and had $10,086
in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $754 in interest expense,
for a net loss of $10,840.


For the six months ended June 30, 2015 we generated no revenues and had $14,316
in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $528 in interest expense,
for a net loss of $14,844.



GOING CONCERN



Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is
substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next
twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. Our cash
balance at June 30, 2016 was $194. We believe our cash balance and loans from
our director are sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations.


9






OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.



LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



There is no historical financial information about us on which to base an
evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and have not
generated revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in
our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources,
possible delays in implementing our business plan, and possible cost overruns
due to increases in the cost of services.


All work is done by the Company's President at no cost to the Company. Mr.
Hargrave receives no salary and he donates parts from his own inventory at no
cost to the Company. The Company's major expense is corporate costs including
accounting which the Company estimates at a monthly average of $1,000. The
Company's present cash balance of $194 will last about 1 week at the present
"burn rate".


To become profitable and competitive, we must implement our business plan and
generate revenue and raise additional capital.





PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSE



The Company estimates its quarterly public company expense as follows:






Audit review          $1,800
Accounting               450
Edgar                    500
                      ------
Total                 $2,750
                      ======









LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Our director has agreed to advance funds as needed. While he has agreed to
advance the funds he is not legally required to do so and may not for any
reason. The Company intends to make an equity offering to its new shareholders
after the distribution.


We received our initial funding of $1,000 through the sale of common stock to
Mr. Hargrave, our officer and director, who purchased 10,000,000 shares of our
common stock at $0.0001 per share on June 22, 2013. On June 9, 2014, Mr.
Hargrave purchased an additional 25,000,000 shares for $2,500. Our financial
statements from inception (February 22, 2013) through June 30, 2016 report no
revenues and net losses of $54,005.

PLAN OF OPERATION



The following are the past and projected future activities of the company in
milestone format. The specific timing of each milestone will depend on the
ability of GoGo Baby to raise capital; therefore these dates are estimates which
may not be met.



MILESTONES:




FEBRUARY 22, 2013 TO DECEMBER 31, 2014



The Company has during this period:


*    Purchased a provisional patent on its product


*    Built and operated models of its product successfully


*    Filed for and has received a patent pending on its product


11






JANUARY 1, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015



*    Product Prototype which can be shown to manufacturers of toys and
child car seats.


*    Compiled list of manufacturers of toys and child car seats.



APRIL 1, 2015 TO JUNE 30, 2015



*    Completed version for demo to manufacturers of car seats and toys



JULY 1, 2015 TO DEC 31, 2015



*    Completed new version for testing



FUTURE PLANS




JANUARY 1, 2016 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2016



*    Test latest version on new model cars


*    Make list of prospective manufactures


*    Start contacting manufactures


The prototype must still be tested on several different types of auto and other
vehicles. No prototype has yet been shown nor have we contacted any potential
purchasers or manufacturers.


On April 10, 2016 the company was advised by legal counsel that the patent
pending for the product had been formally turned down. We are now investigating
alternative marketing strategies.



OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.



GOING CONCERN



Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion on March 18, 2016 for December
31, 2015 financial statements. This means that there is substantial doubt that
we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we
obtain additional capital to pay our bills.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  Certain statements in this report on Form 10-Q contain or may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements were based on various factors and were derived utilizing numerous assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas of risk described in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made herein. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Readers should carefully review this report in its entirety, including but not limited to our financial statements and the notes thereto. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  OVERVIEW  Gogo Baby, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on February 22, 2013. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had a cash balance of $202. GoGo Baby may raise additional capital either through debt or equity. No assurances can be given that such efforts will be successful.  Pursuant to a recent registration statement on Form S-1, DTH International Corporation, a shareholder of Gogo Baby Inc., has distributed to its shareholders 1,000,000 shares of its GoGo Baby common stock. The distribution was made to holders of record of DTH International Corporation common stock as of the close of business on December 31, 2013, on the basis of one share of GoGo Baby's common stock for each one share of DTH International Corporation common stock held. The 1,000,000 shares of the common stock distributed to DTH International Corporation shareholders represent 2.7% of all the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. DTH International Corporation acquired 1,500,000 shares of the common stock of GoGo Baby on November 14, 2013, for $1,000. After the distribution, a shareholder of GoGo Baby controls 95% of the outstanding common stock.  The Company plans to attempt to raise additional equity capital by making an equity offering to its new shareholders as soon as possible. New shareholders are the DTH International Corporation shareholders who were shareholders on December 31, 2013.  BUSINESS PLAN  GoGo Baby, Inc. was incorporated to create toys for small children which attach to car seats to amuse and entertain children while riding in a car.  Our proposed product allows the driver to wirelessly control entertainment toys attached to infant and child car seats located behind the driver, therefore allowing the driver to maintain attention on driving and avoiding distractions caused by turning toys on while driving.  The Company has two operating objectives to its business plan.  OPERATING OBJECTIVE ONE  Our primary Operating Objective is to produce a prototype to sell or license to a large producer of either children's car seats or toys. In order to do this the Company must:  * Phase 1. Produce a viable prototype to demonstrate to the potential car seat/toy manufacturers. The prototype will be designed and built by Mr. Hargrave. More than one prototype may need to be built before a satisfactory design is developed. A prototype can require up to a month to design and build with additional time expended for testing. Material to build the prototype is estimated at less than $100.  * Phase 2. Contact a group of companies which could be potential purchasers' or licensees. The Company will develop a list of potential companies and will contact then by letter and telephone.  * Phase 3. Make presentations to these companies.  To date the Company has built two prototypes and tested them. These are engineering prototypes and are not manufacturing models. The Company is working on additional prototypes which may be of sufficient viability to show to potential car seat/toy manufacturers who may purchase the product or concept. The Company believes it has sufficient capital resources the carry out Operating Objective One, however development cannot always to assured. The Company may face engineering or financial problems which it may not be able to overcome.  If we are unsuccessful at selling or licensing our product, then we may consider our second Operating Objective described below.  OPERATING OBJECTIVE TWO  If Operating Objective One is not successful the Company may consider direct sales of the product on the internet. This would entail a large expense and the Company might not be able to raise the required capital. At this time the requirements are unknown and will be known only when this is considered.  At the present time the Company is not expending time or money on Operating Objective Two and will not do so in the near future. It will be expending all its efforts on Operating Objective One.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We have generated no revenue since inception and have incurred $1,000 research and development expenses through September 30, 2016. From inception date to September 30, 2016 the Company has a net loss of $58,010. The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the period from the date of incorporation through September 30, 2016. Balance Sheet Data: 9/30/2016 ------------------- --------- Cash $ 202 Total assets $ 207 Total liabilities $ 53,712 Shareholders' deficit $(53,505)  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 we generated no revenues and had $3,575 in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $430 in interest expense, for a net loss of $4,005.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015 we generated no revenues and had $4,077 in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $320 in interest expense, for a net loss of $4,397.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we generated no revenues and had $13,661 in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $1,184 in interest expense, for a net loss of $14,845.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we generated no revenues and had $18,393 in general and administrative expenses. We recorded $848 in interest expense, for a net loss of $19,241.  GOING CONCERN  Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. Our cash balance at September 30, 2016 was $202. We believe our cash balance and loans from our director are sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL  There is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and have not generated revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in implementing our business plan, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services.  All work is done by the Company's President at no cost to the Company. Mr. Hargrave receives no salary and he donates parts from his own inventory at no cost to the Company. The Company's major expense is corporate costs including accounting which the Company estimates at a monthly average of $1,000. The Company's present cash balance of $202 will last about 1 week at the present "burn rate".  To become profitable and competitive, we must implement our business plan and generate revenue and raise additional capital.  PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSE The Company estimates its quarterly public company expense as follows: Audit review $1,800 Accounting 450 Edgar 500 ------ Total $2,750 ======  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our director has agreed to advance funds as needed. While he has agreed to advance the funds he is not legally required to do so and may not for any reason. The Company intends to make an equity offering to its new shareholders after the distribution.  We received our initial funding of $1,000 through the sale of common stock to Mr. Hargrave, our officer and director, who purchased 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.0001 per share on June 22, 2013. On June 9, 2014, Mr. Hargrave purchased an additional 25,000,000 shares for $2,500. Our financial statements from inception (February 22, 2013) through September 30, 2016 report no revenues and net losses of $58,010.  Since inception the Company received cash totaling $43,500 from Malcolm Hargrave in the form of promissory notes. The date and terms of the loans are:  1. On December 31, 2013, the Company received a $4,000 loan. This loan is at 4% interest with principle and interest all due on December 31, 2017. On December 31, 2015 the loan was extended to December 31, 2017.  2. On June 30, 2014, the Company received a $6,000 loan. This loan is at 4% interest with principle and interest all due on June 30, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the loan was extended to June 30, 2018.  3. On September 9, 2014, the Company received a $9,000 loan. This loan is at 4% interest with principle and interest all due on September 9, 2016.  4.

This loan is at 4% interest with principle and interest all due on April 11, 2018.  8. On August 3, 2016, the Company received a $1,500 loan. This loan is at 4% interest with principle and interest all due on August 3, 2018.  As of September 30, 2016, accrued interest is $2,703.  PLAN OF OPERATION  The following are the past and projected future activities of the company in milestone format. The specific timing of each milestone will depend on the ability of GoGo Baby to raise capital; therefore these dates are estimates which may not be met.  MILESTONES:  FEBRUARY 22, 2013 TO DECEMBER 31, 2014  The Company has during this period:  * Purchased a provisional patent on its product  * Built and operated models of its product successfully  * Filed for and has received a patent pending on its product  JANUARY 1, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  * Product Prototype which can be shown to manufacturers of toys and child car seats.  * Compiled list of manufacturers of toys and child car seats.  APRIL 1, 2015 TO JUNE 30, 2015  * Completed version for demo to manufacturers of car seats and toys  JULY 1, 2015 TO DEC 31, 2015  * Completed new version for testing  Future Plans  JANUARY 1, 2016 TO DECEMBER 31, 2016  * Test latest version on new model cars  * Make list of prospective manufactures  * Start contacting manufactures  The prototype must still be tested on several different types of auto and other vehicles. No prototype has yet been shown nor have we contacted any potential purchasers or manufacturers.  On April 10, 2016 the company was advised by legal counsel that the patent pending for the product had been formally turned down. We are now investigating alternative marketing strategies.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  GOING CONCERN  Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion on March 18, 2016 for December 31, 2015 financial statements. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT  On November 6, 2016, the Company received a $5,500 loan. This loan is at 4% interest with principle and interest all due on November 6, 2018.

Notes to
Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) September 30,
2016

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GoGo Baby,
Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on February 22, 2013 under
the laws of the State of Delaware to enter into the toy industry.
The GoGo Baby invention of a wireless car seat toy system was
created with the objective to provide a car seat toy system that
the driver can activate from the steering wheel. It is Gogo Baby's
first objective to sell the patent to a major company or secondly
have the toy manufactured, set up an online store and market the
product.

The
Company's activities to date have been limited to organization and
capital. The Company's fiscal year end is December 31.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION - UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They
do not include all information and footnotes required by United
States generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there
has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the
notes to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 included in the Company's Form 10K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on March 18, 2016. The unaudited
financial statements should be read in conjunction with those
financial statements included in the Form 10K. In the opinion of
Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments,
have been made. Operating results for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016.

NOTE 2 -
GOING CONCERN

Future
issuances of the Company's equity or debt securities will be
required in order for the Company to continue to finance its
operations and continue as a going concern. The Company's present
revenues are insufficient to meet operating expenses. The financial
statement of the Company have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among
other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
incurred cumulative net losses of $58,010. since its inception and
requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing
activities to take place. The Company's ability to raise additional
capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown.
The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development
of the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its
transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability
to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may
result from the outcome of these aforementioned
uncertainties.

OVERVIEW

Gogo Baby,
Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on February 22, 2013. As of
September 30, 2016 the Company had a cash balance of $202. GoGo
Baby may raise additional capital either through debt or equity. No
assurances can be given that such efforts will be
successful.

Pursuant
to a recent registration statement on Form S-1, DTH International
Corporation, a shareholder of Gogo Baby Inc., has distributed to
its shareholders 1,000,000 shares of its GoGo Baby common stock.
The distribution was made to holders of record of DTH International
Corporation common stock as of the close of business on December
31, 2013, on the basis of one share of GoGo Baby's common stock for
each one share of DTH International Corporation common stock held.
The 1,000,000 shares of the common stock distributed to DTH
International Corporation shareholders represent 2.7% of all the
issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company.
DTH International Corporation acquired 1,500,000 shares of the
common stock of GoGo Baby on November 14, 2013, for $1,000. After
the distribution, a shareholder of GoGo Baby controls 95% of the
outstanding common stock.

The
Company plans to attempt to raise additional equity capital by
making an equity offering to its new shareholders as soon as
possible. New shareholders are the DTH International Corporation
shareholders who were shareholders on December 31, 2013.

BUSINESS
PLAN

GoGo Baby,
Inc. was incorporated to create toys for small children which
attach to car seats to amuse and entertain children while riding in
a car.

Our
proposed product allows the driver to wirelessly control
entertainment toys attached to infant and child car seats located
behind the driver, therefore allowing the driver to maintain
attention on driving and avoiding distractions caused by turning
toys on while driving.

The
Company has two operating objectives to its business
plan.

OPERATING
OBJECTIVE ONE

Our
primary Operating Objective is to produce a prototype to sell or
license to a large producer of either children's car seats or toys.
In order to do this the Company must:

* Phase 1.
Produce a viable prototype to demonstrate to the potential car
seat/toy manufacturers. The prototype will be designed and built by
Mr. Hargrave. More than one prototype may need to be built before a
satisfactory design is developed. A prototype can require up to a
month to design and build with additional time expended for
testing. Material to build the prototype is estimated at less than
$100.

* Phase 2.
Contact a group of companies which could be potential purchasers'
or licensees. The Company will develop a list of potential
companies and will contact then by letter and telephone.

* Phase 3.
Make presentations to these companies.

To date
the Company has built two prototypes and tested them. These are
engineering prototypes and are not manufacturing models. The
Company is working on additional prototypes which may be of
sufficient viability to show to potential car seat/toy
manufacturers who may purchase the product or concept. The Company
believes it has sufficient capital resources the carry out
Operating Objective One, however development cannot always to
assured. The Company may face engineering or financial problems
which it may not be able to overcome.

If we are
unsuccessful at selling or licensing our product, then we may
consider our second Operating Objective described below.

OPERATING
OBJECTIVE TWO

If

The Original Travelmate!  Just as you cannot imagine traveling without your rolling suitcase, you will wonder how you ever managed without your gogo Kidz® Travelmate!  Updated in 2014 the Travelmate now comes equipped with a Quick Release Ratchet Strap, 3" razor whels, and a fold down plate to accommodate larger car seats. As always, the Travelmate can be attached and removed from a car seat in just seconds.  ·         The gogo Kidz® Travelmate is a convenient and safe attachment for a variety of convertible/toddler car seats. Instead of carrying your car seat and child through an airport, they can now be wheeled through a crowd! ·         The gogo Kidz® is easily mounted or removed and it allows one hand to be free. It features 3” razor wheels and telescopic handle, and weighs in at just 5 lbs. The quick release wheels provide extra clearance for storage and smaller x-ray machines. ·         Looking for something that will work with your infant car seat?  Check out the Travelmate Deluxe or the Travelmate Deluxe CruizerAirports:Because the FAA strongly recommends children under 40 lbs. be seated in a child car seat on an airplane, parents have had to haul their car seats through the airport, straining their backs, arms and patience. The gogo Kidz® Travelmate significantly lightens the load of parents on the go with toddlers and all their gear. A car seat using the gogo Kidz® Travelmate eliminates the need to hand carry, rent or borrow a car seat at your final destination.! WARNING! Do not leave the gogo Kidz® Travelmate attached to the car seat while driving in an automobile. The gogo Kidz has not been tested in combination with any car seats in any crash testing program and injury to your child could occur.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
