Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

  Our Heritage : Van Cleef

Our Heritage

Established as Van Cleef Asset Management in 1988, our heritage dates to the early 1900s. R.R. Alexander & Co. was founded in 1923.
Originally from Oberlin, Ohio, Frank Van Cleef and his son-in-law, Jabez Wood of New York City, joined with Rob Roy Alexander’s firm to create Alexander, Van Cleef, & Wood, in the 1950s. Known as students of fundamental investing, they were strong advocates for personalizing investments, constructing portfolios tailored for each client and concerned with long time horizons.
In 1975 and after substantial growth, then partners Peter Adams and Jon Outcalt merged the firm with a publicly traded investment company and the Van Cleef name was quietly retired. However, with the support of Messrs.’ Adams and Outcalt, Van Cleef Asset Management was formed in the late 1980s to serve a niche in the local community.
Our name owes its longevity to Van Cleef’s reputation as a thoughtful, fundamental investor. The tailored approach to the individual circumstances and risk tolerances of each client has endured for nearly a century and continues to guide us each day.
