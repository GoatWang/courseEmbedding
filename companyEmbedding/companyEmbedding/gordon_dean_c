Gordon C Dean's Experience
Title: Board Member
               Company: Knowledge Beat
Job Details
               KnowledgeBeat has created a model that is not only easily replicated across new sites, but also meets local site needs. The model is based on the deployment of four core programs that target underserved education sectors in Africa. Each program has an underlying construct that does not change, but tactics for implementation are adjusted on a site by site basis. Additionally, by keeping the four programs separate, KnowledgeBeat may choose to deploy only a subset of the programs based on the profile assessment of the site in question. See "Programs" for detail on the individual programs. The KnowledgeBeat team works with the Ministry of Education (ME) to ensure that its programs complement the ME's mission. Each time we enter a new site, we ensure that our implementation plan is in line with both the needs of the site as well as the ME's goals. We do not serve as a replacement for what the ME is responsible for achieving in its schools. Rather, KnowledgeBeat bridges resources gaps in the current education system. Overtime we plan to use the strength of our relationship with the ME to catalyze changes that enable them to better serve rural regions of the country. We have also established a partnership with the Zambian Wildlife Authority (ZAWA). Our commitment to furthering environmental education initiatives as well as ZAWA's presence in our launch site has resulted in a strong relationship that is mutually beneficial. Our team and ZAWA have cooperated closely on the development of the Environmental Education program to ensure that it addresses relevant topics. Furthermore, ZAWA assists with overall program implementation by providing transport, accommodations and other resources to our team. As such, it is our intention to focus our expansion on sites where ZAWA is present. We are also partnering with other organizations active in Zambia to bring resources and opportunities that are not part of our core programs to the areas where we work, for instance HIV/AIDs education.
