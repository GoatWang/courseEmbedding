Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

To add multiple images to a single product navigate to Artist>Manage My Store>Mange My Products. Select the product you wish to add images to by clicking on the name or add a new product. In the Manage My Products page that appears select Images in the nav bar. Here you can up to 12 images for this product.

Note only png, jpeg and tiff images are accepted and image file size is limited to 4 mb or less. Use the drag and drop to pull images directly from your computer screen or select Browse Files to pull files from a folder on your computer. Once your images are uploaded you can crop them to the desired section of the image if desired. You can also sort the images as needed by selecting the picture and dragging it to the desired position.
Please note for best results upload high resolution images that are not compressed. This will result in images that are not pixelated and look crisp and clear. We encourage you to upload images sized at a minimum of 1000 x 1000 pixels. If your products are not a square, please make sure one side is at least 1000 pixels.
You do not need to crop your image, our system will automatically resize the image for you. If you upload a square image the image will be resized to 185 x 185 pixels. If you upload a rectangular image one side will be resized to 185 while maintaining the image aspect ratio.
If you choose to crop select the crop icon under the image and move the white square to the desired area of the image and select save. Cropping only affects the product thumbnail which appears on your artist store. Cropping does not reduce the size of the image or remove any portion of the image. 
If your product has detail which will help in selling it then cropping is a great tool to use. Give it a try!
