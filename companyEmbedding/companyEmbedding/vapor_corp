Vapor Corp. (VPCO: OTCBB: $7.50) is a leading player in the nascent e-cigarette industry. The e-cigarette industry could grow at 40% per year over the next decade due to increased adoption driven by a number of trends, including legality, social acceptability, health reasons, cost effectiveness, increased awareness and increased variety.
Vapor Corp. has the third largest retail presence behind Blu and NJOY. The company's products are in over 60,000 retail outlets in the United States. Vapor Corp.'s largest competitors Blu and NJOY have a retail presence of over 136,000 stores and 80,000 retail outlets, respectively. Retail presence is a key metric to determine winners and losers in the industry as shelf space is a key barrier to entry.
Vapor Corp.'s products provide superior value on a price per puff metric to its e-cigarette competitors and traditional cigarettes.
In addition to the e-cigarette opportunity, Vapor Corp.'s vaporizer product is compatible with marijuana, opening a huge additional market for the company. Only one of Vapor Corp's competitors offer a vaporizer product meaning there is limited competition in the space.
Vapor Corp. is undervalued. Recent acquisitions in the industry have been on an average EV/Sales multiple of 3.2x. Given the projected growth in the industry and Vapor Corp.'s strong competitive position, the company could see revenues triple over the next 2 years from $26 million in 2013 to $75 million in 2015. Placing the 3.2x EV/Sales on projected 2015 revenues, Vapor Corp.'s EV should be $240 million or an annualized return of 44% over the next 2 years, leading to a 2015 Target Price of $15.65.

Both Vapor Corp.'s and Blu's disposable products are at roughly a 20% discount to a traditional cigarette price per puff while, NJOY's product is priced at a 15% premium to traditional cigarettes and a 35% premium to Vapor Corp. and Blu. Other competitors, such as Mistic and Victory, did not have disposables e-cigarettes available for purchase online. Vapor Corp. had the largest selection of disposable e-cigarettes of any competitor, in both product price points and flavors.

Vapor Corp. also sells refill cartridges in packs of five for $10.95. One cartridge is equal to 160 puffs. The replaceable cartridge comes in tobacco and menthol.

E-Cigarettes Key Trends
A recent Center for Disease Control and Prevention press release found that in 2011 nearly 1 in 5 adult cigarette smokers tried e-cigarettes. This number is up 10% from 2010. Currently about 6% of all adults have tried vapor smoking, which is nearly double the estimate in 2010. A number of trends including legality, social acceptability, health reasons, cost effectiveness, increased awareness, and increased variety are driving the growing adoption of e-cigarettes.

While legislators banned tobacco cigarettes in public places across the nation, e-cigarettes are not as regulated. Some cities such as New York, Chicago, and Long Beach have placed similar prohibitions on the use of e-cigarettes to the prohibition placed on traditional cigarettes, but overall consumers can use e-cigarettes in the vast majority of cities. This creates significant demand for e-cigarettes, particularly in cold weather locations, as smokers can get their nicotine fix indoors. E-cigarette industry participants expect a nationwide age restrictions and a restriction on TV advertising. The restriction on TV advertising would be a benefit for Vapor Corp. as the larger players are currently advertising on TV; while, Vapor Corp. does not have the scale or marketing budget to advertise. A ban would level the playing field.
E-cigarettes are more socially acceptable than traditional cigarettes. For many, the unacceptable part of traditional cigarettes is smoke and the smell of the smoke. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes do not produce smoke. This leads to a lower level of intrusion and a higher level of social acceptance. A Harris Interactive survey the 2014 American E-Cigarette Etiquette Survey confirmed the social acceptance with nearly 63% of Americans stating someone using an e-cigarette near them would not bother them.

E-cigarettes are less of a health risk than traditional cigarettes. With traditional cigarettes, smokers are inhaling a number of additives that cause cancer including tar, benzene, formaldehyde, arsenic, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine itself does not cause cancer. It is a stimulant similar to caffeine. Stimulants increase your heart rate, speeds up other bodily functions and constrict blood vessels. Both are highly addictive and can cause severe withdrawal symptoms making it difficult to quit.

E-cigarettes are more effective than patches or gum at helping smokers stop quitting as it replicates the process of smoking. The process of smoking becomes almost as addictive as nicotine, with some estimating 60-70% of the addiction is the process of placing a cigarette to your lips. The patch carries other disadvantages such as potential visibility, side effects, and inability of the user to control the dosage. A study conducted by the National Institute for Health Innovation at the University of Auckland showed the percentage of e-cigarette quitters was higher than nicotine patches and placebo at 7.3%, 5.8% and 4.1%, respectively. The study also showed relapsed e-cigarette users smoked less. Of the volunteers in the e-cigarette group, 57% halved their daily cigarette use by the end of the 6 months, compared with only 41% in the nicotine patches group and 45% in the placebo group. According to the Center for Disease Control in 2011, 68.9% of adult smokers wanted to quit smoking and 42.7% attempted to quit. With such a high desire to quit, the effectiveness of e-cigarettes and the similarities to the smoking process, e-cigarettes are an attractive option to quit or decrease their usage. The total market for smoking cessation products such as nicotine patches and gum is estimated at $835 million.
E-cigarettes are also cheaper than traditional cigarettes. As illustrated above, Vapor Corp. disposable King size product is about 20% cheaper per puff than a traditional cigarette at an average US cigarette price of $6.50 per pack. The Tobacco Atlas places the average pack of cigarettes at $6.36 in the U.S. confirm the $6.50 price per pack. According to Vizualstatistix, in 2012, the average U.S. smoker smoked 19.1 cigarettes a day. At a consumption rate of 20 cigarettes per day, the average smoker in the U.S. saves $478 per year with e-cigarettes. The disposable King size e-cigarette is the most expensive product over a year. Savings would be much more if the consumer purchased a rechargeable product or a vaporizer product. On a conservative measure a smoker would save a minimum of 20% per year switching to e-cigarettes.

E-cigarettes are gaining increased awareness as e-cigarette manufactures NJOY and Blu are advertising heavily. NJOY had a commercial during the Super Bowl and Blu enlisted celebrities Stephen Dorff and Jenny McCarthy to promote their products. Legislators banned tobacco advertising from television in 1970 and banned from outdoor advertising in 1997, giving a significant advantage to e-cigarettes.
To increase appeal, e-cigarettes are available in a wide variety of flavors. This should entice social smokers. Regulators banned tobacco companies from adding any flavors to traditional cigarettes.
The growing adoption of e-cigarettes is driven by a number of trends including: legality, social acceptability, health reasons, cost effectiveness, increased awareness, and increased variety, should continue.
Competitive Landscape
There are more than 200 e-cigarette producers. The number of competitors is decreasing but competitive pressures are increasing as the large tobacco companies are entering the fray. Lorillard (NYSE:LO), the third largest tobacco company and maker of Newport cigarettes was the first to enter the e-cigarette market with its April 2012 purchase of Blu. In February 2014, Altria (NYSE:MO), the largest U.S. tobacco company and maker of Marlboro, acquired Green Smoke to enter the e-cigarette market. Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), the second largest U.S. tobacco company and maker of Camel, entered the market in 2013 with their own e-cigarette offering, Vuse.
The increased competition from larger players will lead to an eventual consolidation in the market with 5-10 players at the end of the industry shakeout, as economies of scale will be present in the market. Vapor Corp believes there will be 3-4 large players and 6-7 second tier players, with the three large tobacco players and one other player in the top-tier. The large fixed costs associated with marketing and potential regulatory costs will likely eliminate smaller players. Marketing is particularly important at the early stages of an industry life cycle when no brand has established itself as the clear leader and all companies are trying to increase brand awareness. Vapor Corp mentions e-cigarettes are seeing 60% repeat business pointing to a strong brand loyalty similar to the tobacco industry.

Limited shelf space at retailers creates another important market inefficiency, as the FDA may ban online sales of e-cigarettes. The access to retail outlets will be one of the key determinants of survival. The large tobacco companies will gain access given their relationships from traditional tobacco but for smaller companies this will be important to monitor. As discussed earlier, Lorillard's Blu has the largest retail presence in over 136,000 retail outlets. NJOY is in over 80,000 retail outlets. Vapor Corporations products are available in over 60,000 retail outlets. Mistic sells its e-cigarettes in over 40,000 stores nationwide. The recent merger between Victory and Finn increased the combined entities retail presence to over 50,000 stores nationwide. Logic's e-cigarettes are in 10,000 retail outlets.
Market Size
Electronic cigarettes' sales grew from almost nothing five years ago, to roughly $500 million in 2012 and over $1.5 billion in 2013. E-cigarettes presence is illustrated by 75% of tobacco retailers carrying at least one e-cigarette brand. The growth in the market will continue. Wells Fargo and Bloomberg Industries estimate e-cigarettes sales will surpass traditional cigarettes within the next decade. The U.S. tobacco industry is a $90 billion industry. The most optimistic scenario puts the U.S. e-cigarette market at over $80 billion in ten years, representing a 47% compound annual growth rate and the global opportunity at $300 billion in 10 years. Assuming no-growth in the overall tobacco market size and 50% cannibalization of tobacco cigarettes sales, e-cigarettes' sales could reach $45 billion in 10 years, representing almost 40% growth per year. Using a more conservative estimate of 25% of total traditional cigarette sales, the e-cigarette industry could reach $20 billion over the next decade or a compound annual growth rate of over 30% per year for the next decade.


A recent study by Linarch Research and Citi placed the E-cigarette market size at $1 billion at the end of 2012. They estimate the market size will triple to $3.2 billion by the end of 2015.
Why Buy Now?
In October 2013, the company completed a $10 million private placement of common stock. According to Vapor Corp., 60% of e-cigarette buyers are repeat buyers, pointing to a brand loyalty similar to tobacco industry, where customers are extremely fussy about which cigarettes they smoke. First mover advantage and locking in customers are crucial to having a strong competitive position. Any capital to aid this goal is crucial.
On December 20, 2013, Family Dollar (NYSE:FDO) stores across the U.S. started selling KRAVE® KING brand of disposable e-cigarette products. Vapor's products are now in more than 60,000 retail outlets in the U.S. and Canada. As mentioned above, the company's store count is one of the largest in the industry. Distribution and the ability to gain shelf space is a key barrier to entry in the industry and Vapor Corp. being one of the leaders in the industry, with its products in more than 60,000 retail outlet, gives them a very strong competitive position.
On December 23, 2013, the company announced a 1-for-5 reverse stock split to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement in order to seek listing of the common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The company expects an up listing to the NASDAQ Capital Market by the middle of 2014. This will increase the number of investors able to invest in Vapor Corp.
On January 7, 2014, Vapor Corp. unveiled the e-cigarette industry's first biometric technology. According to CEO Kevin Frija:
"The next trend in alternative smoking devices is the personalized vaporizer that incorporates the technology that we expect from our high-end tech devices. By incorporating this biometric user identity technology into the VaporX personal vaporizer, the door is opened to many customizable features. The fingerprint lock security allows customers to protect their device from use by another individual and this same technology will lead to the development of additional features and controls."

On February 6, 2014, Vapor Corp announced Ryan Kavanaugh will join as member of the Board of Directors and Strategic Advisor five days after the company files its 2014 Annual Report. Ryan Kavanaugh is an investor and principal of Knight Global, a family office. Mr. Kavanaugh is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Relativity, a next-generation media company engaged in multiple aspects of entertainment; including film production, financing and distribution, television, sports management, music publishing and digital media.
Mr. Kavanaugh is a highly successful producer and global expert in film finance. Under his leadership, Relativity has produced, distributed, or structured financing for more than 200 motion pictures generating more than $17 billion in worldwide box-office revenue and earning 60 Oscar® nominations.
Kavanaugh began his entertainment industry career as the architect of innovative slate-financing arrangements for a number of major studios. He designed feature-film funding structures for Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., and others, introducing more than $10 billion in capital to the sector. Relativity evolved from a finance and production company into a full-fledged movie studio after Kavanaugh led its acquisition of Overture Films' marketing and distribution operations in 2010. He further strengthened the studio's distribution network by negotiating a first-of-its-kind television deal with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), forging a strategic partnership with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Mobile and Virgin Produced and overseeing the studio's aggressive expansion into China.
On February 26, 2014, Vapor Corp. announced its full year 2014 results. The company reported strong results with revenues growing by 22%. The company was profitable with a huge turnaround in profitability. 2013 Operating income was $276,561, compared with an operating loss of ($2,386,913) for 2012. Net income for 2013 was $801,352 compared with a net loss of ($1,920,972) for 2012.
What is this opportunity worth?

In addition to the acquisitions listed above, Imperial Tobacco, Europe's second largest tobacco company and maker of Davidoff cigarettes purchased Dragonite International in September 2013. In October 2013, Lorillard increased its e-cigarette offering and geographical presence with its acquisition of European e-cigarette SKYCIG.

Imperial's acquisition of Dragonite International was an IP acquisition. Neither Victory nor VAPESTICK's previous owners provided revenue figures. With the information available the average Enterprise Value/Sales multiple was 3.2x.
Given the recent acquisitions in the industry have been on an average EV/Sales multiple of 3.2x, and given the projected growth in the industry and Vapor Corp.'s strong competitive position, it could see revenues triple over the next 2 years from $26 million in 2013 to $75 million in 2015. Placing the 3.2x EV/Sales on projected 2015 revenues, Vapor Corp.'s EV should be $240 million or an annualized return of 44% over the next 2 years.
Technical Analysis by Harry Boxer (TheTechTrader.com)

Vapor Corp. moved from under $2 to near $10 from May to December 2013. Over the flowing 3 months, it pulled back to test the $5.75 level near the major rising channel bottom support and last week bounced off that support to get back to just under $8. The 15-month rising channel and solid technicals indicate higher levels may be forth coming. First, Vapor Corp.'s stock price needs to retest and take out of that $9.75-10 resistance zone. If that occurs, our technical price objectives are set at $12.50, $15.50-$16, and then $19-$20!

Risks
The e-cigarette industry could face increasing regulation. Regulators have clamped down on e-cigarette use in some areas of the country, placing restrictions on e-cigarettes similar to the restrictions on traditional cigarettes.
As mentioned above, the e-cigarette industry is extremely competitive. Vapor Corp. is competing against large tobacco companies with very deep pockets and strong political connections. Vapor Corp. has a strong competitive position based on its retail presence and product offering, the most diverse of any e-cigarette company.
To increase retail network and brand presence will take capital, Vapor Corp. may need additional funding, which could dilute existing shareholders.
Vapor Corp. currently trades on the OTC market and its stock has limited liquidity. There may be an impact to price when making large purchases and sales. The expectation of listing on NASDAQ will help.
Conclusion
Vapor Corp. is a leading player in the nascent e-cigarette industry. The e-cigarette industry could grow at 40% per year over the next decade due to increased adoption driven by a number of trends including: legality, social acceptability, health reasons, cost effectiveness, increased awareness, and increased variety.
Vapor Corp. has the third largest retail presence behind Blu and NJOY. The company's products are in over 60,000 retail outlets in the United States compared to Blu's store count of over 136,000 and NJOY in over 80,000 retail outlets. Retail presence is a key metric to determine winners and losers in the industry as shelf space is a key barrier to entry.
Vapor Corp.'s products provide superior value on a price per puff metric to its e-cigarette competitors and traditional cigarettes.
In addition to the e-cigarette opportunity, Vapor Corp.'s vaporizer product is compatible with marijuana, opening a huge additional market for the company. Only one of Vapor Corp.'s competitors offer a vaporizer product so there is limited competition in the space.
Vapor Corp. is undervalued. Recent acquisitions in the industry have been on an average EV/Sales multiple of 3.2x. Given the projected growth in the industry and Vapor Corp.'s strong competitive position, it could see revenues triple over the next 2 years from $26 million in 2013 to $75 million in 2015.

DANIA BEACH, Fla. and MIAMI, Dec. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Vapor Corp. (NASDAQ CM: VPCO; "Vapor"), a leading U.S. based vaporizer and electronic cigarette company whose brands include emagine vaporTM, Krave®, VaporX®, Hookah Stix®, Alternacig®, and Fifty-One®, announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to merge with Vaporin, Inc. (OTCQB:  VAPO; "Vaporin"), a distributor and marketer of vaporizers, tanks, mods ("VTM's") and e-liquid products, whereby Vapor will be the surviving entity. At the effective time of the merger, all issued and outstanding shares of Vaporin common stock will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of Vapor common stock such that former Vaporin stockholders will collectively hold approximately 45% of the issued and outstanding shares of Vapor common stock immediately following consummation of the merger.
The parties expect that the merger will close in the first half of 2015. The closing is conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. In addition to these customary closing conditions, Vapor's obligation to close the merger is contingent upon Vapor obtaining agreements and commitments for certain third-party financing transactions. These conditions include that a new $3.5 million equity financing be placed into escrow with the only condition to the release of these funds from escrow to Vapor being the closing of the merger with Vaporin. Additionally, Vapor must have also received commitments from certain third-parties for financing of up to $25 million. Either party may terminate the merger agreement if the conditions to closing have not been satisfied or waived on or before May 14, 2015. Under certain circumstances, the termination of the merger agreement may obligate one of the parties to pay the other a termination fee.
The merger agreement follows the execution of a binding term sheet announced by Vapor and Vaporin companies on November 6, 2014. 
Vapor and Vaporin also entered into a 50/50 joint venture through Emagine the Vape Store, LLC ("Emagine"), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company. Vaporin will serve as the initial manager of Emagine and will manage the day-to-day operations of Emagine. The purpose of the joint venture is to obtain and build-out retail stores for the sale of Vapor and Vaporin products under the "emagine vapor" and "The Vape Store, Inc." names or other brands of the respective parties. 
Jeff Holman, Chairman, President and CEO of Vapor, commented, "I am extremely excited to advance towards the completion of our strategic merger with Vaporin. In addition to Vaporin offering a high-quality, complimentary product line to Vapor, I am excited at the prospect of leveraging their retail knowledge and having their team spearhead our efforts to expand the footprint of our emagine vapor retail locations." 
Commenting on the merger, Greg Brauser, Chief Operating Officer of Vaporin Inc., noted, "As a first-mover to satisfy shifting consumer demand towards vaporizers, Vapor Corp. remains at the forefront of this burgeoning industry.  We are excited to join forces with Vapor in order to leverage their share of the e-cig, vaporizer and accessories market in building a unique brick-and-mortar retail presence for our combined product lines."

                Delta Faucet - Open trough bath faucet            


1 hour ago
Delta Faucet


                            Purchased 2 identical bath faucets at a plumbing supply store. Not Home Depot or Lowe's. I was shipped 2 identical faucets w/ 2 mfg dates 6 months apart. The earlier faucet has a design flaw. It was corrected in the later version. Delta wouldn't even exchange it. Said it wasn't a warranty issue. Offered to sell me another one at 1/2 price ($225)! They even admitted that there was a design issue. Won't buy delta again!                        Read more

Bass Pro Shops


                            So I guess I learned my lesson today at Bass Pro shops. Customer service doesn't exist anymore, its all about the $$$$. The department manager and the General Manager of the Pyramid are a serious disappointment. Bass Pro sends out a sales flyer to their customer data base promoting for once a great deal on ammo. Well sucker me was like, "I am going to drive straight home from a hard days work, load the dog up, and drive to the store and get me...                        Read more

Vapor Corp. Leads E-Cigarette Market With Unique Brands
March 4, 2011  by Rory J. Thompson  
With both health concerns and smoking prohibitions rising, more and more  smokers are turning to electronic cigarettes to satisfy their nicotine  craving, which is just fine with Vapor Corp. “We’re not only the largest  electronic cigarette manufacturer in the industry, but we’re also the  only publicly traded one,” says Adam Frija, director of business  development at the Florida based company. Vapor Corp. was founded by a  team of veteran entrepreneurs with extensive experience, ranging from  product and brand development to manufacturing and sales of various  consumer products. “The company’s innovative personal vaporizers offer  cigarette smokers a better smoking alternative, as they’re designed to  allow smokers greater freedom and enable them to smoke in public  places,” Frija says. Vapor Corp.’s products eliminate the danger of  second-hand smoke to the nonsmoking community.
The company began by selling its products in mall kiosks, and  eventually expanded into wholesaling to other kiosk owners. “We went  from being in about five kiosks to more than 50 in just one year,” Frija  says. Because of the exposure in malls, Vapor Corp. began to develop  relationships with convenience stores, independent retailers, the  supermarket industry and even pharmacy chains. They then reached out to  distributors across the country. “All told, it only took about three  years from the beginning until now,” Frija says. The company now focuses  on the wholesaling side, promoting its two biggest sellers in the  personal vaporizer line, the Smoke 51 rechargeable brand and the  Krave500 disposable e-cigarette.
“Personal vaporizers are electronic devices, the functional elements  of which are integrated into a stainless steel shell, and include a  small plastic cartridge that contains an absorbent material moistened  with a propylene-glycol liquid solution,” Frija says. “That solution may  or may not contain nicotine, tobacco flavoring or other flavor  essences, an electronic airflow sensor, a heating element, which  vaporizes the liquid in the mouthpiece so that it can be inhaled, a  rechargeable lithium ion battery, which powers the device, and certain  electronic components,” he adds.
The Smoke 51 allows a user the freedom to smoke virtually anywhere,  without the flame, ash, tar, or carbon monoxide found in traditional  tobacco cigarettes. Because it’s rechargeable, it can be used over and  over again, saving the smoker considerable costs in not having to buy  cigarettes. For smokers who want to try an e-cigarette without  committing, Vapor Corp. also manufactures the Krave 500 and Krave 300,  disposable versions of the Smoke 51 that are good for up to 500 and 300  puffs, respectively. “These unique electronic cigarettes are one piece  units, meaning there are no atomizers to screw in, no filters to  replace, and no batteries to recharge,” Frija says. “They’re ready to  enjoy right out of the pack.” Once a user is done with a Krave, they  simply dispose of the entire unit.
The Smoke 51 comes in two options, with everything a smoker needs to  enjoy an e-cigarette. The Fifty One duo wholesales for $35 to $50,  depending on volume ordered, and the Fifty One trio ranges from $15 to  $25, again depending on which packaging option is requested. The units  retail for at least double that, and markups go as high as 500 percent,  depending on traffic and store location. The Krave500 and 300 disposable  e-cigarettes feature an equally high retail return. There is no minimum  order, but Frija notes that some outlets request a few units initially,  and then increase their order when they see how well they sell. “Some  cigar shops order six or 12 at a time,” he says. Volume discounts are  available, depending on how many of each product are ordered, and  display pieces are available for retailers who request them. “Krave500  is a POS purchase item, so we have a display rack that holds anywhere  between 18 and 21 pieces,” Frija says. “We also have an in-house graphic  design department, and are flexible to work with retailers, as some  want the signage narrower, taller or wider to fit their specific needs.”  For new customers, Vapor Corp. will work with them to get the best  possible pricing. “We do have tiered distribution, and pricing is based  on volume,” Frija says. “Right now, brick and mortar, mom and pop, and  convenience stores are seeing a lot of traffic with the Krave500,” he  adds. Vapor Corp. is constantly introducing new packaging as word of the  product spreads. “We have both gift sets and starter sets for new  customers,” Frija says. “They contain everything a smoker needs to  experience this new technology.”
