The Company
Lescarden. Focused on the future of healing, naturally
Lescarden Incorporated is a biotechnology company dedicated to the research and development 
                  of proprietary biologic materials with a focus on wound healing, clinical skin care, osteoarthritis, autoimmune and cancer applications. Lescarden’s research team is responsible for the breakthrough studies that have uncovered the unique pharmacological properties of cartilage and its derivatives. These efforts, spanning five decades, stand today as the foundation of any clinical investigation into the therapeutic application of cartilage.
Fathers of cartilage therapy
Lescarden Inc., a publicly-owned biotechnology company, was founded in 1960 by the late  John Prudden MD, MED. Sc.D., a Harvard-trained physician known as the “father of cartilage therapy.” 
As an Associate Professor of Clinical Surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in 1954, 
                  Dr. Prudden first observed the extraordinary properties in cartilage while investigating various materials in an effort to reverse the negative effects that corticosteroids had on wound healing.  Applying cartilage powder to open wounds, Dr. Prudden enthusiastically noted that the substance accelerated the wound healing and reduced inflammation of the surrounding tissues. 
Numerous studies, by the Lescarden research team as well as other leading scientists, have continued to define and expand upon the array of beneficial pharmacological properties of bovine cartilage both topically and systemically.  Years of product testing and refinement has led to the creation of Lescarden’s proprietary formula for purifying bovine cartilage producing a sterile white powder that optimizes the healing and anti-inflammatory processes. Today, the company’s exclusive bovine cartilage powder, marketed as Catrix®, is FDA and EU approved for the management of chronic wounds and severe burns.
Catrix is a natural, non-toxic, non-steroidal, collagen-rich mucopolysaccharide product that functions in the body as a biological response modifier, stimulating the body to repair itself. Some demonstrated effects of Catrix both in vitro and in vivo include:


Acceleration      of wound healing
Displays better quality of granulation and      vascularization tissue
Increases      scar strength (wound’s resistance to tearing) by 50%
Reduces      inflammation both topically and systemically
Inhibits      the formation of malignant cells
Immune      system enhancement 


Addressing patient needs

Originally developed for chronic wound care, Catrix-based products are now valued by dermatologists, plastic surgeons, physicians, general surgeons and other healthcare professionals for many more applications. 
Catrix Skin Care products are clinically proven to soothe and rejuvenate rapidly heal skin compromised by cosmetic procedures, such as chemical peels, laser resurfacing and microdermabrasions. 
In addition, Lescarden produces pharmaceutical grade nutritional supplements, which include: 
Bio-Cartilage; 100% pure bovine cartilage for inflammatory joint disease and immune system enhancement, and Poly-NAG, a sustained-release source of glucosamine, recommended for alleviating the pain of osteoarthritis and promoting overall joint health. 
As the discoverers of bovine cartilage, Lescarden is confident that the true value of Catrix to the medical community has not been fully realized. The company is committed to investing in ongoing research and development to explore the vast potential of its healing properties. 
Clinical and laboratory studies point to Catrix as a potential agent for the treatment of certain cancers . In addition, Lescarden has embarked on clinical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Poly-NAG for use in veterinary applications.

LCAR.. $0.0258 Products that work..   Catrix®. Superior healing. Beautiful results.    The process of healing takes time. Patients recovering from cosmetic procedures, surgical wounds, chronic lesions, trauma or burns, face variables, but one thing is certain. For the patient, the process of healing can never occur fast enough.    Catrix is clinically proven to expedite the healing process. Trusted by dermatologists, plastic surgeons, general surgeons and other healthcare professionals, Catrix accelerates the body’s own natural healing process, helping patients to feel more like themselves again—sooner than they ever imagined.    What makes Catrix different?    Catrix is the only product that harnesses the unique healing and anti-inflammatory properties derived from whole, specially processed bovine tracheal cartilage. Discovered as a natural healing agent more than 50 years ago by Lescarden, Catrix powder has the power to heal inside and out—naturally. Recognized for its therapeutically diverse applications, Catrix is available in a number of product formulations for various conditions.    Catrix Skin Care products – Originally developed to provide relief from irritation and discomfort following cosmetic procedures, such as chemical peels and laser resurfacing, Catrix is beneficial as part of a daily regimen to maintain a youthful appearance.   Catrix Wound Dressing – Approved by the FDA and EU, Catrix Wound Dressing is highly effective in the management of a range of difficult-to-heal wounds including pressure ulcers, diabetic ulcers, first, second, and third degree burns, post-radiation dermatitis, and trauma wounds.  Catrix® Wound Dressing  A therapeutic weapon for chronic wounds   Download Catrix Wound Dressing full US prescribing information (PDF)    The cornerstone of the Catrix product line, Catrix Wound Dressing is renowned for its superior   healing characteristics.    Approved by the FDA in 1998, Catrix Wound Dressing is a natural, biodegradable product,   made from a specially processed bovine cartilage in the form of a fine white powder. Catrix has no chemical additives.    When applied directly to non-healing wounds, such as debubitus ulcers (bedsores), diabetic ulcers, and venous ulcers, Catrix Wound Dressing actually accelerates the healing process, effectively closing the wounds while minimizing scarring.    In studies performed on wounds that had previously failed to respond to months of standard wound healing treatment, dramatic improvements were seen in just seven weeks!    FDA-approved for multiple healing applications   Catrix Wound Dressing is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is EU-certified for the management of:   •Pressure ulcers (stages I-IV)  •Stasis ulcers  •1st and 2nd degree burns  •Diabetic ulcers  •Post-surgical incisions  •Radiation dermatitis  •Cuts, abrasions and irritations  •Partial thickness wounds  •Skin conditions associated with peristomal care  How Catrix Wound Dressing works    The unique properties Catrix Wound Dressing work with the body’s own healing capabilities to effectively close wounds. Catrix stimulates granulation within the wound, establishing a matrix that induces the development of the necessary components (connective tissue, skin, blood vessels) needed to heal. Containing 50% micronized collagen, Catrix Wound Dressing accelerates the biological process of reparation by activating the following processes:   •Attracts fibroblasts – encourages production of connective tissue  •Activates macrophages – stimulates formation of blood vessels  •Stimulates growth of fibroblastes (12%) and keratinocytes (40%)   •Stimulates growth fibroblasts and keratinocytes   •Increases scar strength (resistance of the wound to tearing) by 50%  The result is a wound that heals rapidly, displays better quality of granulation and vascularization tissue, and a scar that is more aesthetic with superior tensile strength at every stage of its   subsequent recovery.    Advantages of Catrix Wound Dressing   •Biodegradable - does not need to be removed from the wound  •Completely absorbed at seven days  •Compatible with gauzes and with moist applications  •Can absorb exudate up to 10 times its weight  •Controls excess exudates. Keeps the bed of the wound moist  •Has a barrier effect – protects against infection  •Does not harm the skin around the ulcer  •Application is painless  •Reduces bleeding  •Has no adverse effects  Good for patients and the healthcare system   Catrix Wound Dressing offers important benefits to patients and healthcare providers:   •Accelerated healing of wounds - leads to increased patient comfort, improved quality of life, and reduced chance of accidental infection  •Decreased treatment cost - dramatic savings through reduced staff required to treat wounds, lower material cost per treatment, and shortened term of treatment required for full recovery  •Simple, convenient application available in single-use foil packets - Catrix Wound Dressing is sprinkled directly from the packet onto the wound - makes it ideal for use in hospitals, extended care facilities and at-home care  •Catrix Wound Dressing is packaged in cartons of 14 and 7, one-gram foil packets.

It also shows exciting promise in the arena of cancer treatment. Bio-Cartilage is a pharmaceutical grade, 100% pure bovine cartilage powder for the nutritional supplement market.    Bio-Cartilage   The Pure Bovine Tracheal Cartilage Supplement    Download Bio-Cartilage label (PDF)    Resulting from the interest generated by published studies using Catrix, Bio-Cartilage is an encapsulated bovine cartilage powder developed for the nutritional supplement marketplace. Pure bovine cartilage has been clinically demonstrated to produce anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-mitotic activities.    Studied in clinical trials for over 20 years, Bio-Cartilage is also backed by more than 30 years of laboratory research conducted by the Lescarden research team. Their findings are regarded as the foundation for any cartilage investigation, and are universally cited by researchers and manufacturers in discussing product efficacy.    Bio-Cartilage is 100% pure bovine tracheal cartilage material, containing 50% type two collagen and 45% mucopolysaccharides, including chondroitin sulfates. Bio-Cartilage is produced to FDA Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) ensuring product quality and consistency. Produced for the nutritional supplement market, Bio-Cartilage is sold on no-claims made basis.   Bio-Cartilage Applications   Inflammatory Joint Disease   Through the natural aging process, the joints become more restricted and experience a decrease in flexibility. In addition the cushioning provided by cartilage and the surrounding synovial fluid degrades leaving the joint more susceptible to stress and disease. Along with exercise, a supplementary regimen including glucosamine and chondroitin has been demonstrated to improve the lubricating environment of the joint and enhance cartilage health. Bio-Cartilage is a natural source of both of these substances. Research undertaken by Lescarden has shown very positive results in the treatment of inflammatory joint disease in animals as well as arthritis in humans.     Immune System Enhancer   Research indicates that bovine cartilage powder acts as a biological response modifier, regulating   the activity of important components of the immune system. Clinical evidence demonstrates that Catrix bovine cartilage stimulates B lymphocytes, which strengthen the immune system by increasing the level of antibodies circulating in the body as well as stimulating T lymphocytes, which identify and fight invasive/foreign cells in the body.     People suffering from psoriasis have also found that Bio-Cartilage, in conjunction with a topical application of a Catrix-based cream, can help to alleviate many of the symptoms of the condition.   This application has been observed in a clinical trial conducted by Lescarden.  Cancer   Dr. Prudden’s research investigating the use of Catrix bovine cartilage as a potential treatment for certain types of cancer evolved from the positive results observed in prior investigations using Catrix in treating psoriasis. Like psoriasis, cancer is characterized by the over proliferation of cells. Studies have  identified in Lescarden’s bovine cartilage a clear protein (not collagen) that is a potent inhibitor of the growth of renal cell carcinoma.   Laboratory and clinical studies have identified potential pharmacological actions in cartilage which may be beneficial in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Researchers have discovered that cartilage has demonstrated a stimulating effect on the immune system, displays anti-mitotic activity (inhibits the process by which cells divide and multiply) and an anti-angiogenic effect  (prevents the growth of new blood vessels) cutting off the blood supply tumors need to grow.    Bio-Cartilage is available in bottles of 360 capsules each containing 750mg.

New studies demonstrate that Poly-NAG is also effective in the area of animal health.    Poly-NAG®  The New Generation Glucosamine Patented, Long-Lasting Glucosamine for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis and Inflammatory Joint Disease    Osteoarthritis, the most common form of chronic joint disease, affects over 21 million people in the United States.  The symptoms range from mild joint discomfort to severe pain, and with some, total loss of mobility.   Osteoarthritis is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints.  Cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a “cushion” between the bones of the joints.   The most common treatment is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen.  Unfortunately, prolonged use of NSAIDs could cause significant adverse side effects such as gastro intestinal ulcers and kidney failures.  Moreover, while NSAIDs alleviate pain and swelling, they mainly address the symptoms and not the underlying cause of the problem. Today, more and more patients, including medical practitioners, are using glucosamine. In clinical studies, glucosamine has been found to be effective in helping to replenish the depleted synovial fluid in the joints which helps improve joint mobility and alleviate pain.  More importantly, glucosamine, a naturally occurring amino sugar, is virtually devoid of harmful side-effects.   The problem with glucosamine is its short half life-once ingested, it stays in the bloodstream for only 30 to 90 minutes. In addition a number of clinical trials on glucosamine have been found deficient causing some discomfort from the medical community.    What is Poly-Nag®?    Poly-Nag is a short chain polymer of glucosamine, Poly-N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine derived from specially processed crustacean shells.  It is patented in North America and Europe as a therapy for osteoarthritis in humans and animals.   The unique molecular structure of Poly-Nag produces clinically proven, timed release effects providing significant benefits:   1.maintains elevated glucosamine in the blood serum over a significantly longer time frame than regular glucosamine, allowing the body to optimize the  therapeutic benefits of Poly-Nag;  2.allows for less, and possibly even-reduced, dosing providing better value and greater convenience for the users.  Studies conducted for Poly-Nag involved both humans and animals undertaken by reputable and independent clinical research organizations in the United States and Canada. Randomized double blind studies demonstrated Poly-Nag’s ‘staying power’ in the blood stream and it’s efficacy in patients suffering from osteoarthritis.  For details of the studies please refer to the Reference Section.   Clinically proven benefits   In clinical trials at the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC), orally administered Poly-NAG was shown to be fully absorbed by the body and metabolized into glucosamine, which was measurably present in subjects’ blood serum. The tests confirmed that serum levels of glucosamine remained higher for a longer time (over 48 hours) in subjects receiving Poly-NAG, compared to subjects receiving plain NAG.    In effect, Poly-NAG offers the arthritis sufferer a form of glucosamine that has “staying power” in the bloodstream.    A randomized double blinded study conducted at UNTHSC, demonstrated the effectiveness of Poly-NAG in treating osteoarthritis. The subjects, all suffering form OA were studied over a six week period and measured using an osteoarthritis severity index, a patient and physician global assessment of pain and mobility as well as an antibody assay for the Osteoarthritis ‘biomarker’. The unanimous results indicated that subjects treated with Poly-NAG displayed significant improvement on all measurements compared to placebo.   Based on the extraordinary results showing the efficacy and long lasting properties, Lescarden was awarded a patent for the use of Poly-NAG in the treatment of osteoarthritis in the US, Canada and in Europe.    How does Poly-Nag Work?    Poly-Nag® is produced from cGMP pharmaceutical grade facilities in North America where its patented, uniquely processed ingredients are packaged.  Its molecules are processed in the body by enzymes called ‘Gut Chitinase’ which was recently discovered in the Gastric Chief Cells, Parotid Gland and von Ebner’s Gland.  Through its uniquely-processed molecules, Poly-Nag® is gradually released into the blood serum, maintaining a high level bioavailability over a significant time frame, where it is then eventually distributed in the joints.    The Poly-Nag Advantage   •Longer lasting glucosamine benefits means more convenient once a day dosing.  •Clinically proven effective for both humans and animals  •Safe and non-toxic for daily use  •Highest quality standards Poly-Nag is manufactured at pharmaceutical production facilities under strict cGMP and each lot is tested to meet Lescarden’s stringent specifications for quality   or purity.  For more information on how Poly-NAG can assist in joint pain relief, contact us today.  -----------------------------------------   For more information on Catrix or to order one of the most natural healing agents on the market,   contact us today.
