All Cap Growth

Strategies
Our SMA strategies are designed to capture growth based on earnings quality, proven competitive advantages, and reasonable valuation. We consider these factors to be the underpinnings of success—the kind of success that is unlikely to disappear overnight.
Oak Ridge All Cap Growth
Our All Cap Growth strategy is designed to outperform the Russell 3000 Growth Index over the long term while taking less risk. It focuses on fast-growing and profitable small, mid-sized, and large-capitalization companies. The strategy stays fully invested, typically holds 40-60 stocks, and is available through our privately managed accounts.

 HUMAN NATURE VERSUS SUCCESSFUL INVESTING
Human nature and emotions tempt investors to follow short-term trends, but successful investing requires a long-term discipline.

 ACTION OVER PROMISES
Hope is not a strategy, which is why we base our decisions on actual intelligible items like reported earnings and industry data, not on analysts' earnings estimates alone.

CHICAGO, Aug. 18, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Oak Ridge Investments, LLC is pleased to announce the launch of three new products by leveraging its specialized investment capabilities. The firm continues to address client demand by diversifying its mutual fund lineup with new strategies which will drive additional asset growth.

	The Oak Ridge Disciplined Growth Fund (ODGIX) invests in U.S. companies growing at above average rates across the market cap range. This fund follows the long-running, fundamentally driven 15 year track record of the Oak Ridge All Cap Growth strategy managed by Robert McVicker. The investment objective of the fund seeks long-term growth of capital, in pursuing its objective the fund aims to outperform the Russell 3000 Growth Index.

	The Oak Ridge Technology Insights Fund (ORTHX) invests in a universe of innovative companies benefiting from the use or application of technology. Portfolio managers Robert Corman and Terence Quinn will use their specialized focus to invest in companies driving market share gains which should lead to sustained earnings growth. The investment objective of the fund is long-term growth of capital, and seeks to outperform the S&P North American Technology Index.

	The Oak Ridge Global Equity Fund (OGESX) is sub-advised by Algert Global, LLC. This global strategy focuses on analyzing inefficiencies in developed equity markets that result from investor behavioral biases and will be benchmarked against the MSCI World Index. The fund's investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation. Through a systematic process, the fund aims to invest in companies with solid fundamentals, attractive relative valuations, and measureable market catalysts.

	Algert Global currently sub-advises two other Oak Ridge strategies, the Oak Ridge International Small Cap Fund (ORIIX) and Oak Ridge Dynamic Small Cap Fund (ORSIX).

	"We believe the new Funds address a client-driven need in the marketplace by providing exposure to specialized investment segments," says Oak Ridge's Chief Operating Officer, Mark Goodwin. "We expect continued AUM growth in our strategies, through lift-outs, acquisitions and with sub-advisory partnerships. New products will be instrumental in achieving these objectives."

	"The uniqueness of the funds' asset classes is a timely and compelling opportunity for our clients," adds Head of Distribution & Marketing, Philip Callahan. "These complementary strategies will deepen the Oak Ridge suite of diversified investment capabilities. Launching three new funds based on the established experience of the funds' portfolio managers is a huge advantage."

Important Risks: Equity securities, such as common stocks, are subject to market, economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate. Investments made in small capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid due to limited resources or product lines and more sensitive to economic factors. The Funds may invest in foreign securities which involves certain risks such as currency volatility, political and social instability and reduced market liquidity. Emerging markets may be more volatile and less liquid than more developed markets and therefore may involve greater risks. The Funds may invest in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and is therefore subject to the same risks as the underlying securities in which the ETF invests as well as entails higher expenses than if invested into the underlying ETF directly. *A shares are not yet available for purchase, I shares are not currently registered in all states.

Oak Ridge Investments expands team with new hire


January 11, 2016
By Iris Dorbian






Oak Ridge Investments has hired James Barclay as senior vice president and regional sales director of the U.S. central region. Previously, Barclay worked at Neuberger Berman.
PRESS RELEASE
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS (PRWEB) JANUARY 11, 2016
Oak Ridge Investments, LLC is pleased to announce the appointment of James Barclay as Senior Vice President and Regional Sales Director of the Central region of the U.S. Barclay will be responsible for positioning our mutual funds, separate accounts and private placement investments within Wealth Management, Retirement, and Private Banks.
Barclay comes to Oak Ridge Investments with over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry serving both the retirement and wealth management channels. He joins from Neuberger Berman, where he held various financial intermediary sales and sales leadership positions since 2000.
Barclay’s product experience is deep and includes mutual funds, separate accounts, private funds, structured products, liquid alternatives and retirement plans. Dedication to his industry and commitment to client service led him to receive the inaugural Neuberger Berman Wirehouse “Roy” Award in January of 2015. This Firm award came from a vote of over 200 of his Firm/Sales peers and selection criteria included consistent sales track record, leadership, product knowledge and being a team player.
“Jim brings extensive experience, knowledge and leadership to Oak Ridge Investments” says Philip J. Callahan, Head of Distribution & Marketing. “His expertise in both wealth management strategies and service will provide great benefits to us internally, and most importantly, to the clients we serve.”
Barclay will operate out of the firm’s Chicago headquarters. Previous to Neuberger Berman, he worked for Calamos Asset Management, Van Kampen Securities and Wayne Hummer Investments.
According to Neil A. Cummins, Chairman, “Effective marketing coverage of our priority distribution channels is a key component of our business strategy. Jim brings his leadership skills and industry network to provide considerable strength to our client-driven and performance-oriented Firm. Jim will play a critical role in achieving the Firm’s future plans for growth; his knowledge and experience in distribution will play an integral role in that success.”
ABOUT OAK RIDGE INVESTMENTS:
Oak Ridge Investments is an investment management firm located in Chicago and New York. Founded in 1989, Oak Ridge is focused on providing select, actively managed equity strategies to its broad range of clients. The firm currently manages above $4.5 billion.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
