Agriculturally Sustainable and Organic Farming
For more than 20 years, we have operated an agricultural development at our Cadiz Valley property. The underlying groundwater, fertile soil, warm desert temperatures, and low occurrence of indigenous pests provide ideal conditions for the production of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, including citrus, grapes, melons, peppers, and squash.
Permanent crops currently in production include grape vineyards grown to certified-organic dried-on-the-vine raisins and lemon orchards. These crops are farmed using sustainable agricultural practices, including organic farming. Seasonal vegetable crops on the property are grown organically and plantings can include vegetables such as squash, asparagus, and beans.
At our Cadiz Valley property, a total of 9,600 acres have been zoned for agricultural development. Presently 2,100 acres are leased by third parties for farming. Our infrastructure includes seven interconnecting wells with an annual production capacity of 13,000 acre-feet of water. Our agricultural operations use water-saving and fuel-efficient practices, including drip irrigation. We also have housing and kitchen facilities that support up to 300 workers.

These Watersheds span an area of more than 1,300 square miles and contain approximately 17 – 34 million acre-feet of water in storage — an amount comparable to Lake Mead, the nation’s largest surface reservoir. (1acre-foot = 326,000 gallons).
Rain and melted snow that falls in the surrounding mountains of the Watersheds percolates into the soil and becomes pure groundwater. Flora, fauna, and springs take what they need at the higher elevations and then groundwater travels from the mountainous upper ends of the Watersheds down through the valley and into the aquifer system. Over time, the water moves slowly through the aquifer system below our property and ends up at the highly saline dry lakes where it becomes undrinkable and is lost to evaporation.
Since 1993, we have used a small portion of the groundwater beneath our property for ongoing agricultural operations. We are also pursuing the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project to conserve some of the groundwater being lost at the dry lakes and put it to beneficial use by delivering a new supply to southern California water providers.

Land
Tweet

Our primary business activities are focused on the pursuit of the highest, best, and most sustainable uses of our land and water resources in eastern San Bernardino County, California.
We own 45,000 acres (70 square miles) of land in eastern San Bernardino County, California, including approximately 34,000 acres in the Cadiz Valley, 9,000 acres in the Piute Valley, and 2,000 acres near Danby Dry Lake. Virtually all of this land is underlain by high-quality, natural groundwater resources and has excellent potential for various uses including groundwater supply and storage projects, agriculture, renewable energy development, permanent open space, and residential development. Click Here for a map of our properties.

Cadiz Valley


We own approximately 34,000 acres (55 square miles) of land and related high-quality groundwater resources in the Cadiz Valley of eastern San Bernardino County. Our property is one of the largest contiguous private landholdings in the region and is located in proximity to the Colorado River Aqueduct and an approved transmission corridor.  The aquifer system underlying this property is located at the confluence of two watersheds spanning approximately 1,300 square miles, an area nearly three times the size of the city of Los Angeles. The watershed is naturally recharged by groundwater that originates as rain and snowmelt in the surrounding mountains. Experts estimate the aquifer system contains roughly 17-34 million acre-feet of pure, indigenous groundwater. The proposed Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project would be located on a small portion of the property.
About 9,600 acres of this property have been zoned for agricultural development; approximately 500 acres are currently farmed. We rely on groundwater for irrigation.  Additionally, we are currently considering the use of additional portions of this property for solar energy development.


Piute Valley


Our second largest landholding is comprised of approximately 8,500 acres in the Piute Valley of eastern San Bernardino County. This landholding is located approximately 15 miles from Laughlin, Nevada and about 12 miles from the Colorado River town of Needles, California. Extensive hydrological studies, including the drilling and testing of a full-scale production well, have demonstrated that this land is also underlain by high-quality groundwater. The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by rain and melted snow within a watershed of approximately 975 square miles.


Danby Property


We own an additional 1,500 acres near Danby Dry Lake, approximately 30 miles southeast of our Cadiz Valley property. The Danby Lake property is located approximately 10 miles north of the Colorado River Aqueduct. Initial hydrological studies indicate that it has excellent potential for a sustainable, groundwater conservation and storage project. We are also considering using portions of this property for certain facilities of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project.

Milestones and Next Steps

Since 2008, the Project has achieved many milestones:
2008-09


September 2008:  Cadiz enters into an agreement with the Arizona & California Railroad Company giving Cadiz the ability to build the Water Project’s conveyance pipeline within the railroad’s existing right-of-way. The pipeline will be built along the railroad tracks on pre-disturbed land.
May 2009:  Cadiz enters into a Green Compact with the Natural Heritage Institute pledging to preserve lands, restore ecosystems, manage the aquifer system sustainably, and explore solar power production.


2010


February 2010:  CH2M HILL releases results of year-long, peer-reviewed study measuring the vast scale and productivity of the Cadiz aquifer system. The study, which was conducted utilizing new field work and new models produced by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2006 and 2008, confirms that the aquifer system can sustainably support the Water Project.   Carlton Professor of Geology Dr. John Sharp of the University of Texas releases his first peer review report on the Cadiz wells, strongly supporting the conclusions of the CH2M HILL study.
April 2010:  California State Geologist, Certified Hydrologist, and Professor at USC Dr. Dennis Williams of GeoScience Support Services, Inc. releases GeoScience’s peer review report “Geohydrologic Assessment of the Fenner Gap Area” strongly supporting the conclusions of the CH2M Hill study.
May 2010:  Carlton Professor of Geology Dr. John Sharp of the University of Texas releases his second peer review report on the permeability of the carbonate aquifer, strongly supporting the conclusions of the CH2M Hill study.
June 2010:  Santa Margarita Water District (“SMWD”) joins Project committing to act as lead agency for the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) environmental review process; committing funds to the environmental review process; and acquiring an option in the Project for a firm annual supply of water and groundwater storage rights.
Three Valleys Municipal Water District and Golden State Water Company join the Project committing funds to the CEQA environmental review process and acquiring an option in the Project for a firm annual supply of water and groundwater storage rights.
October 2010:  Suburban Water Systems joins the Project committing funds to the CEQA environmental review process and acquiring an option in the Project for a firm annual supply of water and groundwater storage rights.


2011


February 2011: SMWD issues a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) formally commencing the public portion of the CEQA process for the Project. A 30-day scoping period is also initiated. Scoping meetings were held by SMWD on March 16th and March 24th. Click here to view copy of the NOP.
May 2011: A Groundwater Stewardship Committee comprised of leading national groundwater experts is assembled to guide the design of the operating plan and groundwater monitoring program for the Project. Committee members are drawn from various sectors and include experts from regulatory institutions, environmental organizations, academia and the professional groundwater industry.
Jurupa Community Services District joins the Project committing funds to the CEQA environmental review process and acquiring an option in the Project for a firm annual supply of water and groundwater storage rights.
Economist John E. Husing, Ph.D. finds that the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (“Project”) would create and support over 5,900 jobs, generate more than $878 million in economic activity over its two phases, and infuse tens of millions in tax revenue to local governments.
October 2011: The Groundwater Stewardship Committee completes its review of the Project’s technical and scientific studies and determines that the Project can offer a significant water supply to Southern California communities and avoid environmental harm. The GSC’s report, which includes recommendations for the inclusion of a state-of-the-art groundwater protection program, also found that the Project can feasibly recover 1.3 million acre-feet of clean groundwater from impending evaporation over a fifty year period of operation with a continuing conservation benefit of an additional 900,000 acre-feet occurring thereafter.
December 2011: California Water Service Company joins the Project acquiring an option in the Project for a firm annual supply of water and groundwater storage rights. SMWD releases the Project’s Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for public review and comment. To view a copy of the Draft EIR, click here.


2012


January/ February 2012: SMWD hosts an informational workshop about the Project and two public comment meetings to take verbal comments on the Draft EIR.
March 2012: Draft EIR public comment period closes March 14, 2012.
May 2012: Company pledges 50% of labor force and 80% of infrastructure spending for Cadiz Valley Water Project to San Bernardino County residents and businesses.
SMWD, Cadiz and the County entered into a Memorandum of Understanding creating the framework for finalizing the Project’s Groundwater Management, Monitoring, and Mitigation Plan (GMMMP), in accordance with the County’s desert groundwater ordinance. The GMMMP  is a key component of the Project designed to monitor aquifer conditions and establish measures to protect against impacts to critical desert resources and would be enforced by the County The MOU also reserved up to 20% of the Project’s annual yield for the future use of County-based water providers under terms and conditions similar to those of other Project participants.
July 2012: SMWD releases Final EIR responding  to all comments received on the draft environmental documents and holds a public hearing. On July 31st, the SMWD Board voted 5-0 to certify the Final EIR and approve the Project. At the meeting, SMWD also approved the Project’s Groundwater Management, Monitoring and Mitigation Plan and their Purchase and Sale Agreement with Cadiz, which finalizes economic terms for SMWD’s participation in the Project.
October 2012: The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors voted to approve the final GMMMP for the Project.  The County is a Responsible Agency in the CEQA review process as the local government entity responsible for oversight over groundwater resources in the Cadiz Valley.  In addition to approving the GMMMP, the County adopted certain findings under CEQA and became the first Responsible Agency to take an approving action pursuant to the certified EIR.


2013


August 2013: We released a new report prepared by engineering consulting firm CH2M HILL detailing almost $8 million in annual cost savings to Southern California water users that can be realized through the introduction of the Project’s high-quality water into the region’s water transportation system.  This amounts to nearly $400 million in savings to regional ratepayers over the 50-year life of the Project ($203 million in today’s dollars).
October 2013: We released a new report by GHA Water Inc. finding that the Project could provide $648 million in additional benefits to the Southern California water system, if the Project qualifies as Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) under Colorado River supply management guidelines adopted in 2007 by the US Bureau of Reclamation.
October 2013: A new independent peer review of the Project’s hydrology is released by Anthony Brown, one of Southern California’s most respected hydrologists and Principal Hydrologist at Aquilogic as part of the settlement of a CEQA lawsuit challenging the Project’s approvals filed by Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA).  After being given unrestricted access to the Project site, data and modeling, Brown concluded that the Project will not lead to significant impacts to the environment or critical resources of the desert, such as land surface elevation, water quality or regional springs.
December 2013: Trial in the six remaining CEQA cases pending against the Project began in early December and concluded in February 2014.


2014


May 2014: The Judge in the six CEQA cases issued a Minute Order denying all claims against the Project and upholding the CEQA approvals.
August 2014: Statements of Decision in the six cases issued by the Judge.
August 2014: Lake Arrowhead Community Services District, a California water retailer, and the Company sign a Letter of Intent reserving 3,000 acre-feet of water from the Project for delivery to the LACSD service area.


2015


March 2015: Cadiz Inc. Establishes 7,400-Acre Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank in San Bernardino County, California. The Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank is the largest bank ever approved by California Department of Fish & Wildlife for exclusive protection of the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Under an MOU with San Diego Zoo Global, the Bank Lands will also provide ongoing species research.
June 2015: Announced plans to install in-line hydropower turbines in the Cadiz Water Project pipeline to generate electric power to provide lighting, refrigeration and heating to the ARZC railroad operation, including its transloading operation in Rice, California. By installing in-line power turbines in the pipeline, as proposed, low-cost, renewable energy will be generated to meet ARZC’s local business objectives.
Also announced a strategic development agreement with Semitropic Water Storage District, the manager of one of the world’s largest groundwater banking operations.  The agreement sets forth principals for collaboration on the operations of the Cadiz Project and Semitropic’s groundwater bank for mutual benefit, though exchanges or transfers of water supplies.
August 2015: Announced plans to use a highly-efficient state approved technology to treat Project water supplies for naturally occurring Chromium-6 (Cr-6) prior to its entering the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California’s Colorado River Aqueduct. The technology is capable of treating Cr-6 and arsenic to a level of non-detect. The MCL for total Chromium (Cr-6 and Cr-3) in California is 50 ppb.
October 2015: Retiring State Director of the California Office of the BLM sends the Company a letter evaluation of the Project’s proposed use of the ARZC railroad right-of-way for its pipeline. The controversial evaluation summarizes that although the pipeline will provide railroad benefits because it will also serve a commercial purpose it requires a separate right-of-way permit from the BLM. This evaluation was the first of its kind BLM, which has long allowed longitudinal infrastructure to co-locate in railroad rights-of-way without additional permits required.
November 2015: Otay Water District Board in San Diego County authorizes its General Manager to negotiate participation in the Project.


2016


May 2016:  California Court of Appeal, 4th District issues 6 separate unanimous rulings sustaining the lower court’s judgements which had validated the CEQA review and approval of the Cadiz Water Project. .
Summer 2016: Bi-partisan members of Congress request legislation that would clarify the scope of railroad rights-of-way over federal lands and allow third-party use without additional permitting. The House Oversight Committee also initiates investigation into the October 2015 BLM evaluation and communications with third parties.
September 2016: The California Chamber of Commerce joins project support list.


2017


January 2017: Project named to various priority infrastructure lists, including one prepared by the National Building Trades Union, prepared for new Trump Administration.
February 2017: Bi-partisan members of Congress send letter to the Department of the Interior to request a withdrawal of BLM’s railroad right-of-way evaluation policy, as well as the 2015 Cadiz evaluation. The letter also requests that Interior find that the Cadiz Water Project is within the scope of the right-of-way.
March 2017: Bureau of Land Management issues IM-2017-060, which rescinds the previous administration’s railroad right-of-way evaluation policy.
May 2017: Company announces strategic transaction with Apollo Global Management. Funds affiliated with Apollo provide $60M of capital to repay Cadiz Senior Secured Mortgage Debt of $45M and $15M in new construction capital, and also provide a conditional commitment for up to an additional $240M in construction financing.



Next Steps
The Company must complete purchase arrangements with Project participants, finalize construction design, bidding and financing and move ahead to the construction phase.
Preliminary estimates of construction costs are approximately $225 – 275 million depending upon a number of factors, including material prices. Operations and maintenance costs are estimated to be less than $100/acre-foot and will largely depend upon the cost of power. The Project is expected to create approximately 1,100 direct and indirect jobs per year of construction and contribute over $5 million of new tax revenue to local government budgets.

The Latest Science
Ensuring that the Project operates sustainably and responsibly is our top priority.  Beginning in 2009, we invested in new science and technical work to evaluate the water resources at the Project area and ensure that the Project would be built and operated without harm to the surrounding environment.
Over 18 months, the internationally respected engineering firm CH2M HILL conducted a comprehensive study measuring the vast scale and recharge rate of the aquifer system at the Project area. The study describes a system with a volume of water in storage comparable to Lake Mead, the nation’s largest surface reservoir, and a significant supply of annual recharge.
This and subsequent studies found that the aquifer system beneath our Cadiz Valley property consists principally of an alluvial, carbonate, and crystalline aquifer; more specifically, gravel-like alluvium, highly permeable dissolved-limestone carbonate rock, and fractured granitic, metamorphic, and volcanic crystalline rock. The porous and cavernous nature of this rock contributes significantly to the productivity of the aquifer system.
CH2M HILL’s analysis found 17-34 million acre-feet of water are in storage in the alluvium (1 acre-foot = 326,000 gallons) and subsequent study and analysis has shown that there could be an additional 7 million acre-feet coursing through the carbonate and crystalline rock layers.
CH2M HILL’s study was peer-reviewed by leading hydrology experts, and the results were corroborated by extensive field research and pump testing.
Major findings of the new studies include:

Estimate of 17-34 million acre-feet of groundwater in alluvial aquifer system alone. . Additional studies show that there could be another 7 million acre-feet flowing through the carbonate and crystalline rock (1 acre-foot = 326,000 gallons);
According to CH2M Hill, application of the latest 2008 USGS computer model (INFIL3.0) results in water recharge rate estimates of approximately 32,000 acre-feet per year;
Character of the underlying carbonate and crystalline units greatly contributes to the productivity of the groundwater basin;
Freshly collected field data corroborates watershed model results; and
Significant, recharging groundwater resource can be conserved so that it is not lost to evaporation.

About Cadiz Inc.

Home About Cadiz Inc. 










 
Since it was founded in 1983, Cadiz Inc. has grown from a small California landowner into a noteworthy renewable resources company that leads a number of sustainable initiatives on more than 45,000 acres in California’s Mojave Desert. Using early satellite imagery at NASA, the Company’s founders identified an extensive aquifer system below the earth in a largely uninhabited part of eastern California. Over several years, Cadiz acquired small sections of land and, through trades and exchanges with old railroad property and the federal government, significantly expanded its holdings. Ultimately, the Company grew into one of the largest contiguous private landowners in California’s eastern Mojave Desert. The company went on to initiate sustainable agriculture projects, green energy and land preservation initiatives, and the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery, and Storage Project, known as the Cadiz Water Project.
The company has focused the majority of its efforts on the Cadiz Water Project, which aims to avoid water waste and preserve as much as 2 million acre-feet of groundwater over its 50-year term. The project addresses water waste by working to prevent large quantities of groundwater from becoming highly-saline and evaporating when it migrates to dry lake playas in the area. To conserve this water, Cadiz and its public agency partners developed a long-term and comprehensive groundwater management program that will recover 50,000 acre-feet of water, less than 1% of the water in the system, from the basin each year for 50 years. The project will also enable participants to import and store surplus water in the groundwater basin for return when needed in future dry years. By launching the Water Project, Cadiz will provide a reliable water source to southern California, create jobs, and provide numerous additional water supply benefits.
Along with responsible stewardship of water resources, the company practices organic farming and seeks to use its resources for land preservation and green energy generation. The company’s sustainable projects are inspired by a Green Compact with the National Heritage Institute that emphasizes the importance of balancing resource management with land preservation efforts. For example, the Cadiz Water Project will preserve habitats and desert ecology by installing pipeline alongside an active railroad track instead of on undisturbed lands and utilize the pipeline to generate new hydro-electric power.

The Parched West

                    Investors Are Mining for Water, the Next Hot Commodity                  
Private companies like Cadiz Inc. and Poseidon Water hope to turn a profit by slaking the mounting thirst of California and the West. But the obstacles are formidable.
By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ














                    U.S. Approves Water Plan in California, but Environmental Opposition Remains                
With California facing a year-end federal deadline to reduce its dependence on Colorado River water, the Interior Department has given its go-ahead to a $1 billion, 50-year plan to store and pump water from beneath private land in the Mojave Desert. The Bush administration's decision removes a major obstacle to the project, proposed by a private company, Cadiz Inc., to help the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California make up future water shortfalls. The plan still faces opposition, which has been led by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, on environmental grounds. It has not yet been approved by the water district's board.











                    Former Interior Secretary to Develop Water Projects in the Middle East                
Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior under President Bill Clinton, has announced that he will become chairman of a company that will develop huge water projects in the Middle East, including Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia. The newly formed company does not yet have a name, but it will be a subsidiary of Cadiz Inc., a little-known but politically well-connected company based in California that has been battling environmentalists for years to sell large amounts of water from deep under the Mojave desert.











                    Private Sector Sets Water Sale To Californians                
In an agreement that would introduce a new level of market influence over the management of water in Southern California, the government agency that supplies roughly 17 million people in the Los Angeles area plans to buy large volumes of privately owned water for the first time. The decision, which effectively relaxes the tight government controls that have always prevailed over this scarce and basic resource, comes after a shift in federal policy and projected shortages of water in the years ahead.

We are a publicly-held natural resources company that owns 70 square miles of property and water resources in Southern California.  Since the 1980s we have operated an agricultural development in the Cadiz Valley of eastern San Bernardino County, California and are presently focused on partnering with public water agencies to implement the Cadiz Water Project, which will create a new water supply for approximately 100,000 Southern California families and make available up to 1 million acre-feet of new groundwater storage capacity.  Guided by a holistic land management strategy, we are dedicated to pursuing sustainable resource development projects and practicing responsible stewardship of our unique land and water assets.
