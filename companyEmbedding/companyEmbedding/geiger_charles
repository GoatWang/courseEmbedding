Geiger is a socially conscientious company that has been in operation for over 130 years. We appreciate your business and are taking measures to maintain your confidence and trust in our services. You deserve a company that does the best job of providing proactive, comprehensive compliance solutions.Click here to learn more about Geiger's commitment to safety.Geiger has a full-time Product Safety department committed to protecting you and your brand. We strive to provide products that are in compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Initiative (CPSIA), Proposition 65 requirements and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our goal is to enhance and protect your brand, not put the reputation of your brand at risk. You can trust Geiger!Our Pledge To You.A number of high-profile news events have brought to light areas of concern that could potentially impact anyone who distributes products manufactured overseas. As a result, here are the initiatives we are taking to insure the safety of the products we distribute:Preferred Vendors.We have strong relationships with our production partners. These vendors have years of proven experience and are proactive in many areas, including product safety and social compliance. They have put their products through testing beyond that being done by inspectors overseas.Factory Visits.We feel that it is not enough that our key production partners monitor their overseas production facilities. We are also taking on active role by doing factory visits to see firsthand how the products are manufactured, to ensure safe working conditions and responsible labor practices are being met. We also work with FLA-certified sources of supply that have to go through regular, rigorous, independent testing to ensure factories are safe and do not employ “sweatshop” labor practices or child labor.Independent Testing.In some cases an independent testing process is available to further validate prior testing results. These products are tested for lead content as well as other chemicals that could be harmful for the user. Products that will be used by children are tested for child safety. Many of the items tested are products that we use on a regular basis for programs and clients nationwide.OUR COMPANY’S COMMITMENT TO ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT  Our Company believes we must not only meet the expectations of our customers and consumers, we must exceed those expectations. To that end, we have adopted standards for the safety, quality and integrity of our products and processes and we are committed to respecting the rights of individuals and protecting the environment. We are dedicated to complying with all applicable laws and to conduct business in an ethical and responsible manner.                       SHOP BYApparelAuto, Health & HomeBags & TotesDrinkwareFun & OutdoorsOfficeRush ServiceSpecialty StoresTrade Shows & EventsWritingSpecialty StoresCloseoutsCorporate GiftsEco FriendlyHealth Care PromotionsMade in the USAEducationNew ProductsHolidayTop SellersOn SaleAbout GeigerPrivacy PolicyTeam, History, and PhilosophyGeiger CaresGreen InitiativesEmployment Opportunities Become a Sales Partner Our Executive TeamSafety TestimonialsTerms of UseServicesFrequently Asked QuestionsProgram Capabilities Geiger Gets It Geiger ExpoPromo BlogGeiger, Geiger Customer Service, PO Box 1609, Lewiston, ME 04241 | 1-888-953-9340 | geigerorders@geiger.com©2017 GEIGER All Rights Reserved.Green Initiatives | geiger.com

We feel that it is our responsibility as a company and as individuals to take an active role in becoming more eco-friendly and energy efficient.UPS® carbon neutral shippingGeiger continuously works towards social responsibility and a declining carbon footprint.  As a pioneer in the Promotional Products industry, we have contracted with UPS to have a carbon offset for every package we ship.The carbon emissions of our UPS shipments to every customer and from every supplier will be fully negated resulting in each shipment being carbon neutral.  Due to our package volume, we are one of the top 10 carbon neutral shippers in the U.S. who have a contract with UPS for all of our shipments.UPS calculates the carbon emissions for Geiger’s UPS shipments, then purchases and retires offsets equaling that amount.  Projects include reforestation, renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass, hydroelectric), methane and landfill gas destruction, wastewater treatment and destruction of industrial pollutants.These projects are carefully chosen by UPS to ensure that they are high-quality, meeting international standards.  UPS’s carbon calculation methodology and processes are certified by The CarbonNeutral Company and verified by Societe’ Generale de Surveillance (SGS).For more, visit the UPS carbon neutral shipping website.  Green at GeigerOur company has already achieved significant reductions in energy consumption by, among other things….Automation of boiler circulation pumps and envelope temperature saves 60,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 12,000 gallons of heating fuel/year.New variable speed air compressor saves 95,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity/year.Heat reclamation from air compressors saves 3,200 gallons of heating oil/year.Replacement of over 1300 light fixtures with high efficiency units and motion sensors saves over 400,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity/yr.Automation of air-conditioning in graphics saves over 50,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity/yr.These changes, alone, result in an annual reduction of electricity usage by 840,000 kilowatt hours and 14,000 gallons of fuel oil. We will keep 816 tons of greenhouse gases out of the air, the equivalent of taking 136 cars off the road.In addition…The company also invested $120,000 to remove 87,000 square feet of roof drain out of the city’s sewer system and 48,000 square feet of roof drain water out of Hart Brook, an endangered inner-city waterway. We have re-piped the entire roof surface drain system out with a new RipRap, Plunge Pool, and Level Lip Spreader at the lower elevation end of our property designed to slow, cool settle, filter and disperse our roof rain water. The project went live in time for the first thunderstorm in late June 2008.And this is just the beginning… Note: The above calculations were made by our Facilities Manager, using these resources: http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html http://www.uwsp.edu/CNR/wcee/keep/Mod1/Flow/Greenhouse_Gas.htm http://www.dpsdesign.org/files/file/presentations/CSI_slides.pdf                      SHOP BYApparelAuto, Health & HomeBags & TotesDrinkwareFun & OutdoorsOfficeRush ServiceSpecialty StoresTrade Shows & EventsWritingSpecialty StoresCloseoutsCorporate GiftsEco FriendlyHealth Care PromotionsMade in the USAEducationNew ProductsHolidayTop SellersOn SaleAbout GeigerPrivacy PolicyTeam, History, and PhilosophyGeiger CaresGreen InitiativesEmployment Opportunities Become a Sales Partner Our Executive TeamSafety TestimonialsTerms of UseServicesFrequently Asked QuestionsProgram Capabilities Geiger Gets It Geiger ExpoPromo BlogGeiger, Geiger Customer Service, PO Box 1609, Lewiston, ME 04241 | 1-888-953-9340 | geigerorders@geiger.com©2017 GEIGER All Rights Reserved.

The company was founded in 1878, when brothers Andrew and Jacob took over their father’s two-room print shop in Newark, New Jersey. A staff of 4 – the brothers, a printer, and a bookkeeper – produced a small line that included advertising calendars, fans, and greeting cards. In the early 1900s, the second generation brothers, Frank, Charles, and George added date books and diaries to their expanding line. In 1930s, Frank's two sons, Ray and Frank, led the firm into the distribution of advertising specialty products made by other companies. Meanwhile, Ray acquired the famous Farmers' Almanac™, becoming its 6th editor and tireless promoter for 60 consecutive years! In 1955, the company moved to its current location in Lewiston, Maine. Two of Ray’s sons, Gene and Peter, manage the company today. Under their guidance, Geiger has experienced unprecedented growth and success which has earned numerous business and civic honors.Each generation has enhanced and reinvigorated the business, but the Geigers themselves are only part of the story. Some 500 talented associates work in the Lewiston and field offices supporting a sales force of more than 450 promotional consultants in nearly every state and more than 50,000 customers. The Geiger WayCustomer Focus1.

The company was founded in 1878, when brothers Andrew and Jacob took over their father’s two-room print shop in Newark, New Jersey. A staff of 4 – the brothers, a printer, and a bookkeeper – produced a small line that included advertising calendars, fans, and greeting cards. In the early 1900s, the second generation brothers, Frank, Charles, and George added date books and diaries to their expanding line. In 1930s, Frank's two sons, Ray and Frank, led the firm into the distribution of advertising specialty products made by other companies. Meanwhile, Ray acquired the famous Farmers' Almanac™, becoming its 6th editor and tireless promoter for 60 consecutive years! In 1955, the company moved to its current location in Lewiston, Maine. Two of Ray’s sons, Gene and Peter, manage the company today. Under their guidance, Geiger has experienced unprecedented growth and success which has earned numerous business and civic honors.Each generation has enhanced and reinvigorated the business, but the Geigers themselves are only part of the story. Some 500 talented associates work in the Lewiston and field offices supporting a sales force of more than 450 promotional consultants in nearly every state and more than 50,000 customers. The Geiger WayCustomer Focus1.

As a company and individuals, we seek to be leaders in education, charity and civic affairs.”Community InvolvementGeiger is committed to making a difference in communities where we live and work and do business. This commitment was emphasized during the opening ceremony at our new Maine facility (April 1955) when Ray Geiger proudly announced that Geiger would be leaders in giving to the community.

Peter is also a board memeber of the Maine State Board of Education.In 2007 the city of Lewiston broke ground for a new state-of-the-art elementary school. Without hesitation the school board selected to name the new school the Raymond A Geiger as a way to show appreciation for all the support that Geiger and the Geiger family have provided the community over the years. The school opened in September 2009 and serves as a model for quality education.We encourage our Associates to be involved in the community, and they are.Industry InvolvementWe encourage our management staff to be involved in business and industry groups.
