Frequently Asked Questions

Do you have spare parts for the 7 Ton ?
Yes, as we design and produce these machines, we carry a full set of spare parts so if you need anything in the future, just give us a call and we can post them to you.  You can also call to our workshop with your machine and we can carry out servicing or any necessary repairs – please phone ahead to book in a time.
How much does delivery cost and how long does it take?
Delivery nationwide is €30.  Because of the weight of the machine, it will arrive on a pallet.  Delivery normally takes 1-3 days.
Is the 7 Ton easy to use?
Yes, anyone can use the 7 Ton log splitter.  For safety it has a 2-hand operating system, so you push a button with one hand and push a handle with the other hand and the machine does the rest.  This keeps your hands away from the axe and therefore out of danger.
Can it break any log?
The 7 Ton machine has its limits.  It is fine for domestic use.  It is perfect for splitting soft woods and can manage some clean hardwoods ie no knots.  If your logs are very well seasoned and have been there for while, then the 7 ton may struggle to break them.  If you have a mix of varieties and have the budget then we would recommend going for one of our vertical machines.  You are welcome to bring some sample logs to test out our full range of log splitters.
What is the difference between the horizontal and vertical machines?
Apart from the fact that a vertical machine is more heavy duty due to its design, it is easier to split logs with a vertical machine.  This is mainly because you can place the log on the workplate and chop the log into sections just like cutting a cake and it stays in the one place.  Whereas when operating the horizontal machine the split log falls to the ground and you must bend down and pick it back up again if you want to split it again.  Having said that, the 7 Ton, due to its economical pricing, is very popular.  In my opinion, if you have a good supply of your own trees, they will grow in many shapes, types and forms and the wind decides which one is next for splitting, then the vertical machine will cope with all types and shapes that you can present to it. 
The vertical machine offers much better precision cutting on knotty timber
 What kind of oil does the 7 Ton need?
It takes Hydraulic 32 or Hydraulic 46 oil.  The log splitter already has oil in it when you buy it.  An oil change is recommended after 50 hours work.  You can buy this replacement oil on our website.
 Does the 7 Ton work with a regular domestic power plug and socket?
Yes, the 7 ton has a regular 13amp 3 pin plug that you use with any domestic appliance. 
 Do you offer a warranty with your 7 Ton log splitter?
Yes, we offer a 12 month warranty with all of our products.  And that is a genuine warranty.  If, in the unlikely event that you have a problem with your log splitter, we will be able to get it sorted for you – that is our promise. We’ve designed these machines and know how they work inside out.  There are some stores selling log splitters that have no expertise at all when it comes to how the machines actually work.  When you encounter a problem all they can do is offer you your money back – leaving you without what you need – a log splitter.
Can I bring a log to your showroom and test out your log splitter?
Yes, you are welcome to bring sample logs and test out all of the log splitter models.  We can then best advise you on what machine will suit you and your timber.
 Vertical Log Splitters
What’s the main difference between your 9 Ton and 10 Ton models?
Besides the fact that there is a 1 ton difference in the splitting force, the 10 Ton is a taller machine.  For a tall person the 10 ton is a more comfortable machine to use as the arms are 6 inches higher than the 9 ton arms. 
Do you have spare parts for the vertical log splitters?
Yes, as we design and produce these machines, we carry a full set of spare parts so if you need anything in the future, just give us a call and we can post them to you.  You can also call to our workshop with your machine and we can carry out servicing or any necessary repairs – please phone ahead to book in a time.
How much does delivery cost and how long does it take?
Delivery nationwide is €30.  Because of the weight of the machine, it will arrive on a pallet.  Delivery normally takes 1-2 days.
Are the vertical log splitters easy to use?
Yes, anyone can use the our vertical log splitters.  For safety it has a 2-hand operating system.  This keeps your hands away from the axe and therefore out of danger.
Can your log splitters break any log?
Every log splitter has its limits.  That is why there are 8, 9, 10, 12 and 40 ton log splitters.  It depends on the type of wood you have and the size of the logs.  However, our vertical models are very impressive.  If you have mostly softwoods but and do a good bit of splitting then for comfort we would go for the 8 ton rather than the 7 ton.  You’re upright when using and it will be a long term investment  so is worth the extra few bob.  If your logs are mostly hardwoods then we would recommend moving up to the 9, 10 and 12 ton models.  You are welcome to bring some sample logs to test out our full range of log splitters.
What is the difference between the horizontal and vertical machines?
Apart from the fact that a vertical machine is more heavy duty due to its design, it is easier to split logs with a vertical machine.  This is mainly because you can place the log on the workplate and chop the log into sections just like cutting a cake and it stays in the one place.  Whereas when operating the horizontal machine the split log falls to the ground and you must bend down and pick it back up again if you want to split it again.  Having said that, the 7 Ton, due to its economical pricing, is very popular.  In my opinion, if you have a good supply of your own trees then you will have many shapes, species and densities of log and it is the wind that usually decides which one is next for splitting.  In this case, our vertical machines will cope with all types and odd shapes that you can present to it.  The vertical machine offers much better precision cutting on knotty timber
What kind of oil does vertical log splitter need?
It takes Hydraulic 32 or Hydraulic 46 oil.  The log splitter already has oil in it when you buy it.  An oil change is recommended after 50 hours work.  You can buy this replacement oil on our website.
What kind of power supply does the vertical log splitter need?
The MAX AXE 10 Ton is a single phase machine (230V – 50Hz).  It comes with a circular blue 16amp plug (male end) which requires a female end socket.
Can I change the plug to a regular 13amp 3 pin plug?
We do not recommend changing the plug as your machine will not be getting enough power flowing for the 3000W motor and you may damage your motor as a result.  If you do not already have a socket for a 16amp plug then they are readily available and your electrician will easily wire it up for you.
Do you offer a warranty with your log splitters?
Yes, we offer a 12 month warranty with all of our products.  And that is a genuine warranty.  If, in the unlikely event that you have a problem with your log splitter, we will be able to get it sorted for you – that is our promise. We’ve designed these machines and know how they work inside out.  There are some stores selling log splitters that have no expertise at all when it comes to how the machines actually work.  When you encounter a problem all they can do is offer you your money back – leaving you without what you need – a log splitter.  Down the road, when you are out of warranty we can always offer you servicing or repair
Can I bring a log to your showroom and test out your log splitter?
Yes, you are welcome to bring sample logs and test out all of our MAX AXE log splitter models.  We can then best advise you on what machine will suit you and your timber.
Is it easy to move the log splitter around?
There are two wheels at the back of the machine and a handle at the top so you can lean the log splitter back and wheel it into position, similar to a wheelie bin.
I’ve seen a log splitter for sale with two axes, one at each end.  It’s advertised as a 10 Ton log splitter. It’s a lot cheaper and smaller than yours. What is the difference between your MAX AXE 10 Ton Model and that one?
The log splitter that you have seen advertised as a 10 Ton is, in fact, a 5 Ton machine.  Just because it has a second axe doesn’t magically turn it into a 10ton.  That is like adding a second axe to my 7 ton and then calling it a 14ton – this is impossible.  To get 10 tons of splitting force you, firstly, require a 3000W motor (single phase) which our MAX AXE 10 Ton has.  Secondly, for a machine to withstand 10 tons of splitting force it is essential that the machine has a heavy duty body and ram as seen with all our MAX AXE Vertical Log Splitters – our 10Ton weighs in at a hefty 151kgs.  As everyone knows, putting a second exhaust pipe on a 1litre car does not turn it into a 2litre car – it is just a gimmick.
