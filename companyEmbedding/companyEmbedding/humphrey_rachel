  LEADERSHIP DESIGN   

 
 
                                 IntroductionWelcomeApproachBackgroundFor IndividualsFor OrganizationsThey Say...ClientsContact  IntroductionWelcomeApproachBackgroundFor IndividualsFor OrganizationsThey Say...ClientsContact     WELCOME Leadership DesignFacilitating Personal, Organizational, and Social ChangeI believe that inspired and effective leadership is critical to addressing the biggest issues of our time. And, leadership - whether our own or someone else's - can also greatly color our day-to-day experiences. If leadership, either by an organization or an individual, has such potential for impact on the biggest and smallest aspects of our lives, why not proactively DESIGN it rather than just leave it to chance? I offer consulting and coaching services to help organizations and individuals design their leadership. I see this as a way to pursue my personal mission of facilitating personal, organizational and social change.    APPROACHMy approach is facilitative and participatory in nature. I bring coaching methods to all of my engagements, knowing that when individuals or groups come to their own insights and solutions, both the level of ownership and likelihood of follow through skyrocket. With that in mind, I design processes for inclusive participation, effective collaboration, decisive action, and critical reflection and learning. I approach each engagement first with deep listening skills so I can best understand your needs and culture, and together we develop a design that is customized, flexible, and appropriate. Based on what we decide, I may use a variety of facilitation, research, and assessment methods. I also draw on my 20 years’ experience in the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors to share best practices and resources, as appropriate.     BACKGROUNDRachel has worked extensively in the areas of leadership, change management and strategy development for local, national and international nonprofits and philanthropies. She is a Professional Certified Coach (PCC) through the International Coach Federation and holds a Master’s degree in Nonprofit Administration from the University of San Francisco. She has trained in participatory facilitation and consulting methods with Robert Gass’ Social Transformation Project, Community at Work, Institute of Cultural Affairs, Interaction Institute for Social Change, and the Center for Right Relationships. In addition, Rachel has been a student of Buddhism and yoga since the age of 15, both of which inform her work in coaching and consulting. She is a certified yoga instructor with 300 hours of intensive training with Rusty Wells and nearly 200 hours training with Janet Stone – two internationally renown Bhakti yoga teachers. Rachel has worked both inside of and as a consultant to a number of philanthropic institutions. She currently serves as Program Director for Bay Area Justice Funders Network, where she runs a comprehensive leadership development program for grantmakers. Rachel has led cohort-based capacity building programs with the James Irvine Foundation, Kern Community Foundation, and First 5 Santa Clara; conducted extensive field research for Anne Ray Charitable Trust and the LGBTQ Racial Justice Fund; developed strategy for May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust and the California Communications Access Foundation; and provided customized training and team-building activities for The Christensen Fund and the Global Fund for Women. A long-time champion of human rights, Rachel is Chair of the Board of the International Accountability Project, a human rights advocacy organization that seeks to create development policies and practices that respect people's homes, environment and human rights.    FOR INDIVIDUALSAs I currently have very few openings for coaching clients, I am focusing on providing executive coaching for nonprofit and philanthropic leaders working for social justice Design Your LeadershipExecutive CoachingExecutive coaching is a powerful, professional alliance in which leaders receive customized support to help them lead confidently and effectively. Using proven tools and techniques, I guide you through a process to assess where you are in your leadership and where you want to be. Together, we set goals, create and implement plans, and celebrate successes as you become a more effective leader. As your coach, I can help you:Develop your leadership styleSucceed through empowering othersCommunicate powerfully and authenticallyManage organizational growth and transitionsSustain yourself through a healthy work/life balanceProblem-solve complex or politically-charged situationsCoaching provides invaluable support to leaders at any stage of their career. If you are in a new position, coaching can help you start off on the right foot. If you are reaching a plateau, coaching can help you identify areas of growth or new goals that reinvigorate your work. And, if you are an Executive, coaching can be particularly beneficial in providing you with an appropriate, confidential, and unbiased sounding board. Two recent executive coaching clients described the benefits of our work together as follows: "Rachel helped me clarify my own goals. These conversations helped me understand how to approach each challenge in a way that was best for both the organization and for the organization's grantees and beneficiaries. Her questions helped me understand and see the impacts of everyone's choices. Rachel's commitment to social justice activism is fantastic, and gave me the confidence that we approached these questions from the same set of values."- Executive Director of an international foundation "After 6 months of coaching with Rachel, my relationships with my Board and staff are night and day from where they were. I am much less critical of the Board, and vice versa, and we're able to work together much better now. A key staff member who was a real problem is now performing strongly, and another is stepping up to new challenges successfully. Moreover, I've learned a lot about myself. I've become a better listener and am able to self correct. I am managing challenges thoughtfully and strategically rather than with insecurity or defensiveness.”- Executive Director of a large, local nonprofit organization   FOR ORGANIZATIONSBelow are a few of the consulting services I offer for nonprofit organizations and foundations.This is not the full menu, but rather a sampling to give you a flavor of my work.  Depending on your focus, some of the services may be provided through my role as Program Director at Bay Area Justice Funders Network.  Designing StrategyA participatory and inclusive approach to strategyMany organizations find strategic planning either expensive, a waste of precious time, or both. My approach is to create a strategic planning process that is the appropriate size and scope to fit with your organization’s needs and constraints. I begin with learning about your past planning efforts, organizational culture, and key strategic questions. I then work closely with you to design and facilitate an inclusive and thorough process that allows you to create the plan that best represents your vision for your organization. I often use the Technology of Participation planning method, which is particularly effective in developing consensus and involving people at all levels of the organization. Building CapacityStrengthening leaders, organizations and movementsI design and implement capacity-building programs of all shapes and sizes, calling on my training, facilitation and coaching skills as well as my knowledge of nonprofit management and organizational effectiveness. Often beginning with individual and/or organizational assessment (including Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, StrengthsFinder, and organizational diagnosis), I then create and lead a process for reflection, discovery and action. This may include cohort-based workshop series, peer learning networks or communities of practice, and coaching for individuals and/or teams.Managing ChangeHelping groups navigate change gracefullyOrganizations must manage change as much as they work to create it. Rapid growth, loss of funding, leadership transition, or launching a new program can all present unforeseen structural, operational, and cultural challenges for organizations. I can help organizations plan for (or respond to) critical transition points, helping them be resilient and adaptable in the face of change. Knowing that "the soft stuff is the hard stuff" and that "culture eats strategy for lunch," I focus on the interpersonal and cultural aspects of organizational change as much as the technical and structural.   DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME:HERE'S WHAT CLIENTS SAY James Irvine FoundationGrantee Capacity Building“Rachel is such a wise soul. Her trainings and coaching for our organization have been incredible, and have brought energy and focus to our team during a time of great change. She has been a fantastic facilitator of our Central Coast peer learning network, bringing a wealth of knowledge and tools to our group. We feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to reflect and grow as individuals and an organization under her guidance.”Karyl Lynn BurnsProducing Artistic DirectorRubicon Theatre(Arts Regional Initiative Grantee)Global Citizen YearStaff Training“Rachel provided invaluable training to our global staff on vital organizational issues like decision-making, communication, and managing commitments in our fast-paced, growing organization. She struck the perfect balance between sharing her knowledge and drawing out our own. Moreover, we felt closer as a team and ready to take on the challenges ahead of us after the workshop. I highly recommend her for your next training, workshop or retreat!” Lee LuccaChief Operating OfficerGlobal Fund for WomenFacilitation “Rachel is adept at striking a balance between relationships and results. Ensuring that everybody's voice gets heard while making progress toward desired outcomes isn't easy, but Rachel has an intuitive ability to do just that. Her balanced facilitation style ensures that decisions are reached in a collaborative, supportive environment that strengthens interpersonal relationships in the process.” Kelly McVickerDevelopment OfficerInternational Accountability ProjectExecutive Coaching“Executive coaching has far exceeded my expectations: not only has Rachel helped me grow as a leader, but staff has expressed that 'the work with Rachel has benefited the whole organization.' Weekly coaching has created a vital space for me to address truly important issues which otherwise are overshadowed by an endless stream of other pressing problems. I am proud of all that my organization has achieved since I began as ED, and Rachel has been an integral part of that success.”  Joanna LevittExecutive Director     PARTIAL CLIENT LISTBelow is partial list of past and current clients for coaching and consulting: Philanthropic Institutions:American Jewish World ServiceAnne Ray Charitable TrustCalifornia Communications Access FoundationCollege Access Foundation of CaliforniaDisability Rights FundEnergy FoundationFirelight FoundationFIRST 5 Santa Clara CountyFresno Regional FoundationFRIDA the Young Feminist FundGlobal Fund for WomenGoldman Environmental FoundationInternational Funders for Indigenous PeoplesInternational Human Rights Funders GroupJames Irvine FoundationKern Community FoundationLGBTQ Racial Justice FundMarin Community FoundationMarra FoundationMay and Stanley Smith Charitable TrustOak FoundationOne World Children's FundPartners AsiaPresent Purpose NetworkThe Christensen FundUNWomenUrgent Action Fund for Women's Human RightsWikimedia Foundation Nonprofit Organizations:Action Aid InternationalAmerican Center for International Labor SolidarityAnswerAshoka's ChangemakersAsylum AccessBiodynamic Farming and Gardening AssociationCARE USACasa SerenaCenter for Environmental HealthCeresCornerstone TheaterDavis Art CenterFair Trade USAGirls Inc. of ChattanoogaGlobal Citizen YearGRAIN  Initiative for Conservation in the Andean AmazonInternational Accountability ProjectIPEN - A Toxics-Free FutureL.A.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- CytomX, a biotechnology company developing Probody™ therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, today announced the appointment of Rachel Humphrey, M.D., to its board of directors. Dr. Humphrey previously led immuno-oncology at AstraZeneca and prior to that was responsible for the clinical development of both Yervoy® (ipilmumab) at Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nexavar® (sorafenib) at Bayer.
"Rachel is a foremost authority in oncology clinical development, with a demonstrated ability to advance novel therapeutics that provide tremendous benefit to patients," said Sean McCarthy, D. Phil., chief executive officer of CytomX. "Her deep experience in immuno-oncology and other therapeutic modalities will be invaluable to CytomX as we progress our wholly-owned pipeline of Precision Cancer Immunotherapies and Probody Drug Conjugates to the clinic."
Added Dr. Humphrey, "Probody technology stood out to me as a unique and highly innovative way to unlock the full potential of therapeutic antibodies. The Probody platform has the potential to enable the next generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics, first-in-class monotherapies and combinations, expand the target space for antibody drug conjugates as well as to improve targeting of bispecifics and engineered T-cell therapeutics. I look forward to working with the CytomX board and management team to help realize the company's vision of creating safer, more effective therapies."
Dr. Humphrey recently served as senior vice president and head of immuno-oncology at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. In this capacity, she was responsible for leading the therapeutic area's strategy and oversaw all aspects of the development of its PD-L1 inhibitor (MEDI4736), tremelimumab and the combination. Before this, she was executive vice president and chief medical officer at Mirati Therapeutics, where she helped advance multiple assets through early stage clinical investigation. Prior to Mirati, she served as vice president of product development at Bristol-Myers Squibb. In this capacity, she led all aspects of the clinical development of Yervoy through the submission of global biologics license applications (BLA) and to global launch. Dr. Humphrey also held multiple positions in development at Bayer, where she supervised clinical development of Nexavar for treatment of renal cell carcinoma. She began her career as an oncology fellow and staff physician at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Humphrey received her medical doctorate from Case Western Reserve University and received her bachelor's degree from Harvard University. 
About CytomX Therapeutics CytomX Therapeutics develops Probody™ therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Probodies are masked antibodies that remain inert in healthy tissue but are activated specifically in the disease microenvironment. The Probody approach is designed to blunt systemic toxicities associated with antibodies and expand the therapeutic window of these drugs, unlocking new therapeutic targets. The Company is initially focusing this highly innovative platform to discover and develop new immunotherapy and antibody drug conjugate therapies to treat areas of major unmet medical need in oncology. CytomX has attracted multiple strategic collaborations with industry-leading pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer Inc., ImmunoGen and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
