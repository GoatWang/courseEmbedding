Our Process
In today’s information driven markets, equity prices normally reflect reasonable valuations based on the long term fundamentals of issuing companies. There are, however, often situations in which a security can be temporarily mispriced relative to the issuing company’s prospects for the future. Understanding a company’s long term fundamentals and prospects – and their influence on a security’s value today – is the key to successful fundamental value investing. At Palouse Capital, our seasoned team of investment professionals applies a fundamental value approach to every decision we make on behalf of our clients. We strive to understand the long term prospects of each company we analyze. If we believe that the current price of a security is materially lower than a reasonable fundamentally driven estimate of long term value, we consider the security for purchase. When we believe a current portfolio holding has reached our current estimate of value we consider the security for sale.

Strategies
Small/Mid Value StrategyPCM’s Small/Mid Value (“SMV”) Strategy seeks long term capital appreciation using PCM’s fundamental value approach to security selection. The SMV Strategy is invested primarily in equities with market capitalizations in the $150 million to $5 billion range.

Diversified Income StrategyThe Diversified Income (“DI”) Strategy’s objective is to provide income from diversified asset classes by opportunistically focusing on investments we believe offer relatively high income potential while attempting to avoid asset classes that we believe have relatively high risk.


 Large-Cap Value Total Return StrategyPCM’s Large Cap Total Return (“TR”) Strategy seeks long term capital appreciation while providing an above average level of dividend yield.

All Cap Tilt StrategyPCM’s All Cap Tilt (“ACT”) Strategy uses a mix of large cap passive investment vehicles and actively managed small to mid-cap equities to achieve enhanced all-cap index performance.

Large Cap Value StrategyPCM’s Large Cap Value (“LCV”) Strategy seeks long term capital appreciation using PCM’s fundamental value approach. The LCV Strategy is invested primarily in equities in the $10 billion and higher market cap range.




About Our Name
The Palouse is a grain growing region in Washington and Idaho. The Palouse is known for its rolling grassy hills that are ideal for farming. Kenneth Roberts, our founder, grew up at his family’s homestead in the Palouse region. Like most farm kids, Mr. Roberts helped out with the family farm long after going away to college. The link between the Palouse and Ken is inextricable – and this is why we felt that the Palouse name was appropriate to carry on Ken’s legacy.

LARGE CAP VALUE STRATEGY
PCM’s Large Cap Value (“LCV”) strategy seeks long term capital appreciation using PCM’s fundamental value approach. The LCV strategy is invested primarily in equities in the $10 billion and higher market cap range. We consider the S&P 500® index as the primary universe from which we select securities for the LCV strategy and therefore we sometimes invest in equities with market caps below $10 billion. PCM’s LCV strategy is team managed.

DIVERSIFIED INCOME STRATEGY
PCM’s Diversified Income (“DI”) strategy is managed to generate income and long term capital appreciation. The DI strategy’s investable universe is very large and includes dividend paying common equities, preferred stocks, exchange traded funds and bonds. The DI strategy is tactically allocated to maximize income while controlling risk via asset class diversification. While we generally apply PCM’s fundamental value approach to common equity selection, we prioritize income with all investment decisions. Therefore, we seek to invest in common equities with higher than average dividend yields and dividend potential. PCM’s DI strategy is team managed.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (1.26% upside)

Our Process
In today’s information driven markets, equity prices normally reflect reasonable valuations based on the long term fundamentals of issuing companies. There are, however, often situations in which a security can be temporarily mispriced relative to the issuing company’s prospects for the future. Understanding a company’s long term fundamentals and prospects – and their influence on a security’s value today – is the key to successful fundamental value investing. At Palouse Capital, our seasoned team of investment professionals applies a fundamental value approach to every decision we make on behalf of our clients. We strive to understand the long term prospects of each company we analyze. If we believe that the current price of a security is materially lower than a reasonable fundamentally driven estimate of long term value, we consider the security for purchase. When we believe a current portfolio holding has reached our current estimate of value we consider the security for sale.

About Our Name
The Palouse is a grain growing region in Washington and Idaho. The Palouse is known for its rolling grassy hills that are ideal for farming. Kenneth Roberts, our founder, grew up at his family’s homestead in the Palouse region. Like most farm kids, Mr. Roberts helped out with the family farm long after going away to college. The link between the Palouse and Ken is inextricable – and this is why we felt that the Palouse name was appropriate to carry on Ken’s legacy.
