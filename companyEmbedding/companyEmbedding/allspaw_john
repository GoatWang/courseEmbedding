Blameless PostMortems and a Just Culture

 
                Posted by John Allspaw  on May 22, 2012            

Last week, Owen Thomas wrote a flattering article over at Business Insider on how we handle errors and mistakes at Etsy. I thought I might give some detail on how that actually happens, and why.
Anyone who’s worked with technology at any scale is familiar with failure. Failure cares not about the architecture designs you slave over, the code you write and review, or the alerts and metrics you meticulously pore through.
So: failure happens. This is a foregone conclusion when working with complex systems. But what about those failures that have resulted due to the actions (or lack of action, in some cases) of individuals? What do you do with those careless humans who caused everyone to have a bad day?
Maybe they should be fired. Or maybe they need to be prevented from touching the dangerous bits again. Or maybe they need more training.
This is the traditional view of “human error”, which focuses on the characteristics of the individuals involved. It’s what Sidney Dekker calls the “Bad Apple Theory” – get rid of the bad apples, and you’ll get rid of the human error. Seems simple, right?
We don’t take this traditional view at Etsy. We instead want to view mistakes, errors, slips, lapses, etc. with a perspective of learning. Having blameless Post-Mortems on outages and accidents are part of that.
A Blameless Post-Mortem
What does it mean to have a ‘blameless’ Post-Mortem?
Does it mean everyone gets off the hook for making mistakes? No.
Well, maybe. It depends on what “gets off the hook” means. Let me explain.
Having a Just Culture means that you’re making effort to balance safety and accountability. It means that by investigating mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process of individuals proximate to the failure, an organization can come out safer than it would normally be if it had simply punished the actors involved as a remediation.
Having a “blameless” Post-Mortem process means that engineers whose actions have contributed to an accident can give a detailed account of:

what actions they took at what time,
what effects they observed,
expectations they had,
assumptions they had made,
and their understanding of timeline of events as they occurred.

…and that they can give this detailed account without fear of punishment or retribution.
Why shouldn’t they be punished or reprimanded? Because an engineer who thinks they’re going to be reprimanded are disincentivized to give the details necessary to get an understanding of the mechanism, pathology, and operation of the failure. This lack of understanding of how the accident occurred all but guarantees that it will repeat. If not with the original engineer, another one in the future.
We believe that this detail is paramount to improving safety at Etsy.
If we go with “blame” as the predominant approach, then we’re implicitly accepting that deterrence is how organizations become safer. This is founded in the belief that individuals, not situations, cause errors. It’s also aligned with the idea there has to be some fear that not doing one’s job correctly could lead to punishment. Because the fear of punishment will motivate people to act correctly in the future. Right?
This cycle of name/blame/shame can be looked at like this:

Engineer takes action and contributes to a failure or incident.
Engineer is punished, shamed, blamed, or retrained.
Reduced trust between engineers on the ground (the “sharp end”) and management (the “blunt end”) looking for someone to scapegoat
Engineers become silent on details about actions/situations/observations, resulting in “Cover-Your-Ass” engineering (from fear of punishment)
Management becomes less aware and informed on how work is being performed day to day, and engineers become less educated on lurking or latent conditions for failure due to silence mentioned in #4, above
Errors more likely, latent conditions can’t be identified due to #5, above
Repeat from step 1

We need to avoid this cycle. We want the engineer who has made an error give details about why (either explicitly or implicitly) he or she did what they did; why the action made sense to them at the time. This is paramount to understanding the pathology of the failure. The action made sense to the person at the time they took it, because if it hadn’t made sense to them at the time, they wouldn’t have taken the action in the first place.
The base fundamental here is something Erik Hollnagel has said:
We must strive to understand that accidents don’t happen because people gamble and lose.
Accidents happen because the person believes that:
…what is about to happen is not possible,
…or what is about to happen has no connection to what they are doing,
…or that the possibility of getting the intended outcome is well worth whatever risk there is.
A Second Story
This idea of digging deeper into the circumstance and environment that an engineer found themselves in is called looking for the “Second Story”. In Post-Mortem meetings, we want to find Second Stories to help understand what went wrong.
From Behind Human Error here’s the difference between “first” and “second” stories of human error:



First Stories
Second Stories


Human error is seen as cause of failure
Human error is seen as the effect of systemic vulnerabilities deeper inside the organization


Saying what people should have done is a satisfying way to describe failure
Saying what people should have done doesn’t explain why it made sense for them to do what they did


Telling people to be more careful will make the problem go away
Only by constantly seeking out its vulnerabilities can organizations enhance safety



 Allowing Engineers to Own Their Own Stories
A funny thing happens when engineers make mistakes and feel safe when giving details about it: they are not only willing to be held accountable, they are also enthusiastic in helping the rest of the company avoid the same error in the future. They are, after all, the most expert in their own error. They ought to be heavily involved in coming up with remediation items.
So technically, engineers are not at all “off the hook” with a blameless PostMortem process. They are very much on the hook for helping Etsy become safer and more resilient, in the end. And lo and behold: most engineers I know find this idea of making things better for others a worthwhile exercise.
So what do we do to enable a “Just Culture” at Etsy?

We encourage learning by having these blameless Post-Mortems on outages and accidents.
The goal is to understand how an accident could have happened, in order to better equip ourselves from it happening in the future
We seek out Second Stories, gather details from multiple perspectives on failures, and we don’t punish people for making mistakes.
Instead of punishing engineers, we instead give them the requisite authority to improve safety by allowing them to give detailed accounts of their contributions to failures.
We enable and encourage people who do make mistakes to be the experts on educating the rest of the organization how not to make them in the future.
We accept that there is always a discretionary space where humans can decide to make actions or not, and that the judgement of those decisions lie in hindsight.
We accept that the Hindsight Bias will continue to cloud our assessment of past events, and work hard to eliminate it.
We accept that the Fundamental Attribution Error is also difficult to escape, so we focus on the environment and circumstances people are working in when investigating accidents.
We strive to make sure that the blunt end of the organization understands how work is actually getting done (as opposed to how they imagine it’s getting done, via Gantt charts and procedures) on the sharp end.
The sharp end is relied upon to inform the organization where the line is between appropriate and inappropriate behavior. This isn’t something that the blunt end can come up with on its own.

Failure happens. In order to understand how failures happen, we first have to understand our reactions to failure.
One option is to assume the single cause is incompetence and scream at engineers to make them “pay attention!” or “be more careful!”
Another option is to take a hard look at how the accident actually happened, treat the engineers involved with respect, and learn from the event.
That’s why we have blameless Post-Mortems at Etsy, and why we’re looking to create a Just Culture here.

Thanks for posting this. I really don’t see why anyone would be playing the ‘blame’ game, especially in an environment with 30+ developers or so.
Anyone can make a mistake at any given time. Regardless of knowledge, time working for the company, etc. To assume that ‘mistakes’ are representative of the quality of a worker  seems incredibly naive. Moreover, it denotes ‘arrogance ‘ rather than ‘progress’.
Mistakes are learning and improvement opportunities. I think it is awesome that you guys are putting a label on it and making it ‘official’. While some companies *may* be implementing a  ‘Just Culture’ already, I firmly believe that making it KNOWN to employees and even outside the organization itself, is the right way to promote openness and to make it an ‘easy’ topic for discussion (and hence adoption of the same).
Second stories and Post-Mortem reviews can only add value to an organization. Congrats!

You can foster a blameless attitude even when choosing how to investigate source code changes. svn blame has three aliases to choose from: svn praise, svn annotate and svn ann. Unfortunately git-blame lacks these aliases.

This is a great post.  I was fortunate to receive advice early in my career as a manger from a wise veteran who told me to live by the mantra “Fix the problem, not the blame”.  This was a great simple statement of something I have found to have great depth over the years.  This is a notion that came out of a lot of the discussions of how Japanese companies manage differently from US companies.  Toyota (as usual) is the one most cited.
To be sure, a lot of the tendency to blame comes from culture, so I have developed a number of techniques for de-fusing it.  And a lot of that comes from how you define the problem.  One of my favorite tools for gaining perspective on the problem definition is the “5 whys”.  This guy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmrAkHafwHI does a fabulous job of explaining the basic concept in 3 minutes flat.

Very well said. I couldn’t agree more – in places where blamestorming is the response to an incident, the natural consequence is that those involved become less and less forthcoming with the information required to make the systems safer.
One thing I would add: it’s also critical for a successful process that the output of post-mortems be acted upon in a *timely* and *visible* manner. If someone spends their time doing a bunch of analysis and comes up with recommendations on how to avoid problems but then feels like those recommendations are ignored or not appreicated, that also is highly disincentivizing future analysis. I’m sure Etsy doesn’t have this problem, but I’ve seen it happen in other organizations, especially as they get larger.

Constructolution: Indeed, you’re right. Not acting on remediation items is akin to paying lip-service and essentially dismissing the learning out of hand.
At the moment, in Etsy’s case, we have a 30 days (this is likely too long) due date on remediation tasks to get done, and they are essentially actionable tickets that trump any other work that the engineer is currently working on, including shipping product.
Excellent catch, thanks. 🙂

This was a great article (definitely going to share this link).  I might also add that it would be a good idea to put monitoring in place as well, whenever possible to help avoid the problem.  Whether it be change control or thresholds on key metrics that might have changed drastically when the problem was implemented.  That is our philosophy at LogicMonitor.  We too are aware that people make mistakes, but if you can track when the mistake gets introduced with monitoring you can typically thwart it much quicker and possibly cause less damage than you would have if you didn’t have monitoring in place.  Just another method of providing failsafes.

Great article.  I’m curious what Etsy would do if the problem was not caused by a mistake made, but rather inaction.  I’m thinking of operational type support roles where if action isn’t taken, it can cause an outage.
Then, as a follow up, I’d ask what Etsy does if there were an recurring pattern.
Thanks!

            4 years ago 
Hey Jason, thanks for the comments and questions.
There’s certainly something there in what you’ve mentioned: inaction or in some cases, indecision. In those cases, not acting can be the result of a number of things:
– Perceptual recognition (was the font too small or color not salient enough in a signal that told you to take action?)
– Data overload (are we not detecting when to take action? If we are, is the information that accompanies an alert informative or noisy?)
– Lots of other things that I can’t imagine 🙂
Regarding recurring patterns
This is a question that comes up many times in conversations about this approach. What to do when the same mistake happens again? Or what can look like a recurring pattern? There are a number of questions we can ask about that…
1. If there is a pattern, what allows for that pattern to emerge, if we’re looking at each event? In other words, what *didn’t* we address in previous postmortems that allowed it to happen again?
2. What other ways can we explore events? If we see similar things happening again and again, what perspectives are we not covering?
If we find that the answer to recurring patterns is something that sounds like “I guess that person is just clumsy or not paying attention” or finding that the “pattern” is a person, and not a dynamic or mechanism…then it’s an indication that we’re not digging deep enough for second stories.
Thoughts?

Well reasoned responses.  I’m wondering if there’s value in taking this approach with additional roles in IT.  I’m guessing that you’re focused on development or code teams…  which is great.  I can see parallels in operational teams, even roles like Business Analysts.
With Operational or Run teams it’s often inaction that can cause outages, a missed alert for a filling drive, or failure to head a hardware vendor’s recommendation to upgrade firmware, failure to test backup strategies, etc.
I appreciate your time responding to my questions!

It’s a bit late to comment, but NASA runs the Aviation Safety Reporting System which gives immunity from prosecution to any flight crew that reports on an unsafe incident.

The idea is to avoid people covering up mistakes.  It is more important to report a mistake than it is to punish someone for making a mistake.
It could be one reason why aviation is so safe in the US.
It certainly is an unusual program for the government.

I love this piece, but there are two implicit assumptions it makes that (in my experience) don’t hold true in the real world very often: 
(1) The action that contributed to a failure or incident was an action taken by an Engineer, not a Manager, and
(2) A “blameful” approach will result in reduced quality of work experience over time because of reduced information flow from Engineering to Management.
In my career thus far (a decade and counting), I’ve observed that it’s much more likely for a failure or incident to have a root cause in Management, not in Engineering. My favorite example is when our Management signed a contract for a vendor to provide a critical service through an API, without even checking to see whether that vendor provided that particular service (they didn’t) or even had an API (they don’t). You can’t blame Engineering for being unable to use a product when that product literally doesn’t exist; that sort of logical atrocity is unique to the profession of Management. I’ve never seen an Engineering decision result in anything worse than a small amount of lost data or a few hours of downtime; but I’ve seen Management decisions result in company-wrecking calamities. There’s not even a contest.
Unfortunately, unlike Engineers, there is no mechanism in a corporate hierarchy to “punish, shame, blame, or retrain” a Manager when their action led to a failure or incident. Even when it is clear to everyone studying the situation that a particular Management decision is the direct cause of a failure, the political reality of living in a capitalist society prevents that person from being blamed or held responsible in any way. So, if avoiding blame is truly a better approach for minimizing failure over time — if the claim of this article is indeed true — then we would expect the areas of a company that are intrinsically shielded from blame to be the areas with the LOWEST rates of failure. Instead, we observe them to be the areas with the HIGHEST rates of failure. In other words, failure has an inverse correlation to blame, not a positive correlation as this article suggests.
You rightly point out that “human error is seen as the effect of systemic vulnerabilities deeper inside the organization.” However, those systemic vulnerabilities are all, categorically, the purview of Management. There is no part of the system of a company that is outside the authority of Management to control; ergo, any systemic vulnerability that has been identified and documented, but not eliminated, must exist BECAUSE OF (rather than despite) Management’s choices. When you are talking about Engineering, you can clearly separate the humans from the system they work within, because that system is created and maintained independently of the actions of the Engineers. But when you are talking about Management, there is NO distinction between human failure and systemic failure, because the “system” is entirely the product of human action — in particular, the actions of the humans called Managers. To put it another way, what we call “the system” is simply the collective actions and decisions of Management, so if “the system” fails, then by definition a Manager’s action (or decision not to act) is the cause of that failure.
You might be able to address SOME Engineering failures by avoiding blame and drawing distinctions between human and systemic failures. But you will never be able to minimize failure across an entire company by this approach because (a) people who expect to never be blamed can objectively be seen to fail more often, and (b) the distinctions between human and systemic failures are mostly fictional.

An Open Letter To Monitoring/Metrics/Alerting Companies

Cognitive Systems Engineering, Tools, WebOps /

I’d like to open up a dialogue with companies who are selling X-As-A-Service products that are focused on assisting operations and development teams in tracking the health and performance of their software systems.

Note: It’s likely my suggestions below are understood and embraced by many companies already. I know a number of them who are paying attention to all areas I would want them to, and/or make sure they’re not making claims about their product that aren’t genuine. 

Anomaly detection is important. It can’t be overlooked. We as a discipline need to pay attention to it, and continually get better at it.
But for the companies who rely on your value-add selling point(s) as:

“our product will tell you when things are going wrong” and/or
“our product will automatically fix things when it finds something is wrong”

the implication is these things will somehow relieve the engineer from thinking or doing anything about those activities, so they can focus on more ‘important’ things. “Well-designed automation will keep people from having to do tedious work”, the cartoon-like salesman says.
Please stop doing this. It’s a lie in the form of marketing material and it’s a huge boondoggle that distracts us away from focusing on what we should work on, which is to augment and assist people in solving problems.

Anomaly detection in software is, and always will be, an unsolved problem. Your company will not solve it. Your software will not solve it. Our people will improvise around it and adapt their work to cope with the fact that we will not always know what and how something is wrong at the exact time we need to know.

My suggestion is to first acknowledge this (that your attempts to detect anomalies perfectly, at the right time, is not possible) when you talk to potential customers. Want my business? Say this up front, so we can then move on to talking about how your software will assist my team of expert humans who will always be smarter than your code.
In other words, your monitoring software should take the Tony Stark approach, not the WOPR/HAL9000 approach.
These are things I’d like to know about how you thought about your product:

Tell me about how you used qualitative research in developing your product.
Tell me about how you observed actual engineers in their natural habitat, in the real world, as they detected and responded to anomalies that arose.
Show me your findings from when you had actual UX/UI professionals consider carefully how the interfaces of your product should be designed.
Demonstrate to me the people designing your product have actually been on-call and have experience with the scenario where they needed to understand what the hell was going on, had no idea where to start looking, all under time and consequence pressure.
Show me the people who are building your product take as a first design principle that outages and other “untoward” events are handled not by a lone engineer, but more often then not by a team of engineers all with their different expertise and focus of attention. Successful response depends on not just on anomaly detection, but how the team shares the observations they are making amongst each other in order to come up with actions to take.

 
Stop thinking you’re trying to solve a troubleshooting problem; you’re not.
 
The world you’re trying to sell to is in the business of dynamic fault management. This means that quite often you can’t just take a component out of service and investigate what’s wrong with it. It means diagnosis involves testing hypotheses that could actually make things a lot worse than they already are. This means that phases of responding to issues have overlapping concerns all at the same time. Things like:

I don’t know what is going on.
I have a guess about what is going on, but I’m not sure, and I don’t know how to confirm it.
Because of what Sue and Alice said, and what I see, I think what is going on is X.
Since we think X is happening, I think we should do Y.
Is there a chance that Y will make things worse?
If we don’t know what’s happening with N, can we do M so things don’t get worse, or we can buy time to figure out what to do about N?
Do we think this thing (that we have no clue about) is changing for the better or the worse?
etc.

Instead of telling me about how your software will solve problems, show me you’re trying to build a product that is going to join my team as an awesome team member, because I’m going to think about using/buying your service in the same way I think about hiring.
Sincerely,
John Allspaw

hi John. First of all, I wish to congratulate you on this commendable and unconventional take on monitoring solutions. I do completely agree with you the success criteria for finding the right solution. I have come across several tools as a monitoring solution consultant, however, a very few actually follow this ideology that is important to stand up a real monitoring solution. I like how you start by saying anomaly detection is just not truly possible beyond marketing as I have first hand experience with such problems and I know it’s the real truth behind all the fad. Thanks for the nicely carved out comments and suggestions









Steven Acreman   •  


Hi, I probably work for one of the companies being addressed. We don’t have one of the flashy marketing sites that fill the internet promising instant fixes through machine learning, anomaly detection and a bunch of other snake oil, but I’ve seen them and to some extent I can see why it happens.
I think the marketing hype is fuelled by how investment works. Having sat in numerous VC meetings now presenting on ‘how we are different’ I can say that it’s a real struggle to convey how important it is to solve the basics. Monitoring is too complex, takes too long and often gets in the way of humans. Yet that story is weak compared to ‘we solve big data issues through the use of patented algorithms’. Nobody wants to invest in going back to the beginning to fix the fundamental problems, so what you end up with is companies funded that are a feature on top of what existed before.
A lot of companies therefore have marketing websites that far exceed the quality of their product. Luckily with SaaS you get to try before you buy and it’s a technical sale usually to fairly knowledgable people who try a few products before settling (or like many use quite a few tools).









Jason Simpson   •  


Hey John, overall great post.  I especially liked the bullet points under “These are things I’d like to know about how you thought about your product”.  I got a chance during the early release stage of our product to sit in several large data centers and observe how end users interacted with our product.  I completely agree this type of feedback is critical to help deliver a quality product.  Working with end users should be the golden rule for any product owner.

Yoni Leitersdorf (indeni)   •  


Great letter John.
I read it at an interesting timing as I just got off a call with a customer who said he compares indeni to FTE (full-time equivalent). For those unfamiliar with this comparison – the customer asked himself how many people he needs to hire to get done the same work that indeni does. He said that no other product can do what we do and humans are generally bad at doing it, therefore replacing humans for the task of finding misconfigurations in their infrastructure with software made sense. However, it is humans who need to digest the output from our software – an observation of his that I agree with.
The questions you ask are great, however I noticed that most customers don’t go that far. They ask simpler questions:
1. What can your product find that others can’t? (we share a list of sample issues)
2. How much work do I need to invest to get it up and running? (45 minutes – they don’t believe us and then try and find out its true)
3. How much do I need to invest to keep it running on a weekly basis? (generally, a few minutes a day to review the daily reports)
4. How much does it cost? (an arm and a leg 🙂 )
This has led us to focus our product on being extremely easy to set up and use and assume that 99.99% of the time the UI isn’t even open – the users rely on the emails the system sends them.
And you’re right – watching people in action, fighting issues regularly, is the best way to come up with this conclusion.









Richard Cook, MD   •  


Great post & revealing comments. Adding layers of automation to bawky, awkward automation is rarely productive even if those layers are graceful. 
This was described in the past as “nosocomial automation”. Nosocomial means ‘from those who tend the sick’ and refers to infections from bugs that, through constant exposure to antibiotics, have developed resistance to those antibiotics. The traditional approach to nosocomial infectious diseases has been to create even more powerful antibiotics, the use of which leads to an even more resistance. 
Nosocomial automation is put in place to overcome the difficulties with automation — more specificially, difficulties that we have making sense of what the automation that is already in place is actually doing. The result isn’t elegant or even pretty. The processes of functional accretion and extended size tend to pile up on again and again. 
There is a deeper problem here. Gathering and presenting data — even in sophisticated ways — are a fraction of the problem confronting the operator. From these data the operator must develop and test notions of what has happened, what is going on, and — most importantly — what can be done that will both fix the current problem and not spawn new ones. 
When we watch operators we discover that hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing are often combined with corrective action. Indeed, the way that things get diagnosed is often by fixing them, i.e. doing things in the reverse order to our cannonical notion of what ‘must’ be happening in ops. John Flach wrote about this in a funny paper entitled “Ready, Fire, Aim” [Ready, fire, aim: Toward a theory of meaning processing systems. Attention & Performance XVII, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999] and David Woods described the joining together of all these activities in his paper “The Alarm Problem and Directed Attention in Dynamic Fault Management” [Ergonomics 38(11), 2371-2393, 1995].
All of us are guilty of the “systems fallacy”. This fallacy is the idea that there is a system over there somewhere and that we are, ourselves, ‘outside’ the system, ie. independent of it. The central (but often ignored) notion of systems thinking is that system includes the operators and the managers and everyone and everything else that influences the processes at the center of our attention. In your setting ‘the system’ includes those things with the blinking lights and the stuff monitoring them and the people monitoring the stuff monitoring them and so forth. 
Perhaps the most stressful question facing the operator during an anomally is, “What will happen if I push that button?” The underlying automation is so complicated and indeterminate that the operator can only guess at source of the anomally. If pushing the button fixes the problem we will later conclude that he or she had the correct understanding. But at the moment, pushing the button is both a possible fix for the problem and a hypothesis about what the source is. In a funny way, the therapy becomes a diagnostic test. Failure of the therapy is an indication that the diagnosis was probably wrong. It is for this reason that operators usually proceed from pushing small buttons to pushing larger ones and even large ones before finally pulling down on the big red switch handle in the corner.
Nosocomial automation is identifiable by its inward, technological ‘view’. It seeks to make up for the underlying complexity of the automation. But the real challenge today is to find ways of aiding the operator, ie. taking an outwards, user-centered view. Is this all about UX? Well, better to say that there is a huge, unexamined area out there called OX. 
Nosocomial automation tends to make easy things easier while the hard stuff remains hard. The supreme irony of nosocomial automation is that it makes routine stuff seem easy to do. Because easy stuff is routine it’s entirely possible to apply nosocomial automation and feel that progress has been made. The existence of orderly call rotas and escalation processes is testament to this. They work — mostly — and so long as they do only one person doesn’t sleep soundly. But does anyone think that this is going to remain the case forever? 
My point (sorry about taking so long to get to it) is that monitoring is only one part of resilience. Its value depends a lot on what lies on the reacting, anticipating and learning that is happening elsewhere in the ‘system’ — mostly in the operators. Until our systems analysis includes them its just another systems fallacy.









Peco   •  


John, thank you for sharing your thoughts (which I largely agree with and find encouraging). Our industry is stuck in the vile circle of managing incidents vs systematically eliminating defects/flaws that could turn into incidents. Monitoring data is almost always looked at after the fact (when shit breaks I get alerted and I go investigate). What needs to happen to get past that? Question to both vendors AND operations ninjas.

Hi John, it looks like the link to “dynamic fault management” is broken. I was able to find the paper by searching for https://duckduckgo.com/?q=“dynamic+fault+management”
Thought you would want to know.
