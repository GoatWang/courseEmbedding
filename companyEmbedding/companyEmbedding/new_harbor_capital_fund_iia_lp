Our Strategy
New Harbor Capital is a private equity firm with a unique style – our Investment Team brings true passion, energy, and a commitment to doing good to its investment partnerships.
By working collaboratively with business leaders, New Harbor builds an environment of shared success that fosters sustained growth and long-term profitability.








StrategyOur Process

Investment Criteria
 




The New Harbor Approach
Offer Insight
New Harbor will focus our efforts in areas where we have prior experience, specific interests, and an ability to contribute measurable value. To accomplish this, we leverage the extensive knowledge of our Investment Team and Executive Advisors, as well as focused and directed research. Since 2000, the New Harbor principals have invested in over 180 businesses, and have deployed nearly $500 million of equity capital into investments within our focus areas.
Build Relationships
Relationships are foundational to our approach. New Harbor seeks to build long-term partnerships with sellers and management teams and maintains an active Board of Directors-level involvement with all of our portfolio companies. Many of the founders or CEOs of prior portfolio companies have partnered with, or become Executive Advisors to our affiliates, underscoring our success in building long-term relationships.
Encourage Creativity
Business owners in the lower middle market have complex estate planning, career, and legacy objectives. New Harbor takes pride in our ability to listen closely, and think outside the box to author unique and creative solutions to these often conflicting objectives. Our ability to problem-solve can be the difference maker for a business owner.
Provide Clarity
The core of our value creation approach is to work from a plan that is carefully developed in collaboration with the seller and management prior to making our investment. New Harbor clearly spells out milestones, roles, and success measures. Our approach minimizes the likelihood of misunderstanding or relationship breakdown following our investment.

To understand how New Harbor implements our proven strategy, explore Our Process.

PRESS RELEASE
Chicago IL – New Harbor Capital, a leading investor in the lower middle market focused on growth buyouts of founder-owned healthcare, education and business services companies, today announced the closing of its second private equity fund, New Harbor Capital Fund II, LP with $265 million in capital commitments. The fund was significantly oversubscribed and closed above the original target of $200 million, and above the hard cap of $250 million.
“We are deeply grateful for the near unanimous support of our Fund I investors and their continuing partnership with us in our second fund. We are also excited about the variety of high caliber new investors that are joining us in Fund II,” said Tom Formolo, Founder and Partner of New Harbor Capital. Investors in the Fund represent a diverse group of domestic and international pension funds, endowments, funds of funds, asset managers, family offices and high net worth individuals. Founder and Partner, Ed Lhee commented, “both Fund I and Fund II included significant capital commitments from our team of Executive Advisors. This team of 11 founders and former CEOs of private equity backed companies are vital to our success by providing us critical market insights, assisting in sourcing unique investments, and supporting our portfolio companies and management teams.” 





The strategy for Fund II will be unchanged from Fund I. Specifically, New Harbor utilizes a research-based approach to identify opportunities where it can invest $10 – $40 million per platform in direct partnership with founders and management teams of rapidly growing healthcare, education and business services companies. New Harbor prides itself on the enduring relationships which are fostered by its collaborative approach, creativity and responsiveness to the unique circumstances of business founders.
New Harbor raised its first fund in 2014 with $146 million in capital commitments.
Kirkland & Ellis served as legal advisor to New Harbor Capital.
