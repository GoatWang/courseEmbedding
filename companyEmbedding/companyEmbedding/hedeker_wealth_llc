The way we manage our clients’ hard-earned money will benefit their families for generations. We take that responsibility to heart every day.
Owner/Principal Dean R. Hedeker










Let’s face it,
What we want is an honest conversation with our investment advisor. We want a relationship of trust, sincerity, and honesty. A relationship where our advisor puts us first. After all, our financial wellbeing is of utmost importance to us. Our core values, wants, desires and needs are all tied up in our financial well-being. Our valued relationships with our family and others are deeply affected by our financial well-being. So, it’s important that our investment advisor considers this and above all, places our interests first.
But before we can begin on this journey of trust and honesty, we need to ask a few questions of you and truly understand you and your situation. We want to understand your background and your family.
We want to review your investment statements, your tax returns and your estate planning documents. We want to examine how your investments fit in with your taxes and your estate planning. You may be in a high tax bracket or a low one. You may have a sophisticated trust or a simple will. This all needs to be considered.
When was the last time your investment advisor asked for a copy of your tax return or even looked at your tax return? How can your investments be properly structured without knowing what your estate plan says or what your tax documents say?
In this world filled with hype and everybody promoting their latest gizmo or investment product, isn’t it important that somebody took the time to see that your investments are not only proper, but properly structured?
But the journey doesn’t end there, because as your lives change, so will your wants and needs. The investment advice will continually change as lives change.



Consistent, regular meetings are required to take advantage of the numerous financial and tax opportunities that will come your way on this journey. Questions will need to be asked and answered. Questions such as:

Are ray investments consistent with my risk tolerance?
Are my investments causing me to pay too much tax?
The tax law changed, what can I do to take advantage of the changes?
Are my investments titled properly, consistent with my estate planning?
How does creditor protection fit in with my investments?
How do I reduce the tax bill on my IRA?
How do I reduce the tax I pay on my Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)?
How do Roth Conversions work, and are they right for me?
How about paying for college expenses for my grandchildren?

Of course, there will be other questions and opportunities which will arise as time goes on.
“At Hedeker Wealth, it is not only important that your investments earn money, but that you keep the money you earn.”
Owner/Principal Dean R. Hedeker

You want a real expert with documented credentials helping you plan your financial future and invest your assets in the securities markets.


Real experts have valid, documented credentials that include degrees, experience, and high quality certifications.


Paladin Quality Rating: Paladin is the only SEC registered firm that vets and rates the quality of financial advisors and firms. A 5 Star rating means the advisor or firm scored in the 90th percentile or higher when Paladin rated the quality of their credentials, ethics, business practices, and services.


Experience: Years of experience is the best way for advisors to become real financial experts.


Education: Degrees should be from accredited institutions. Use the Internet to research schools you may not have heard of. Some advisors buy degrees to appear more knowledgeable than they really are.


Certifications: Also called designations, certifications are the best way for advisors to acquire specialized knowledge in shorter time periods. Some certifications are extremely valuable (CFA, CFP, CIMA, CPA). 35% of certifications are fake (Source: Paladin Research).


Associations: Membership in quality associations can also be a source of specialized knowledge if the organizations have continuing education requirements.


Firm Credentials: Some advisors represent firms that employ or license multiple professionals. Some of these professionals may impact your financial results.


Tip: Real experts have good educations, years of experience, and high quality certifications and designations.

April  4, 2017  |  Press Release
Ultimus Fund Solutions to Provide Fund Administration for Hedeker Wealth’s New Mutual Fund,

  Firm Launches First Mutual Fund through Capitol Series Trust

CINCINNATI, OHIO – APRIL 4, 2017  Ultimus Fund Solutions®, LLC (Ultimus®) announced today that it has been chosen to provide comprehensive fund administration services to Chicago, Illinois-based Hedeker Wealth, LLC (Hedeker), as the firm launches its first mutual fund. Hedeker is a registered investment advisory firm that specializes in asset management services for individuals, families, and institutional investors. The Hedeker Strategic Appreciation Fund (the “Fund”) is designed to help bring Hedeker’s separately managed account’s (SMA) strategy to a broader market.

With an already established SMA business, Hedeker will launch its mutual fund product through the Capitol Series Trust (CST), one of four series trusts serviced by Ultimus. As part of the series trust offering, Ultimus will provide the Fund with fund accounting, administration, distribution strategy, transfer agent, and shareholder services. Hedeker selected Ultimus based on the firm’s outstanding reputation and its knowledgeable approach to launching a mutual fund.

Now they can make their convertible bond strategy available to a broader audience,” said Bob Dorsey, CEO and Managing Director of Ultimus. “We are proud to partner with a quality firm like Hedeker whose strengths are their people, customized care, and personal touch in providing professional services. We are excited for the opportunity to serve their clients and continue providing them with the same high quality, high touch service that they are accustomed to receiving from Hedeker.”

“The Hedeker team is very excited to make available to the general investing public an investment strategy that has historically only been available to large institutional investors,” said Michael McClain, CFA Portfolio Manager. “Selecting a Fund Administrator for our convertible bond fund was easy, we went with the best-in-class which is Ultimus.”

The way we manage our clients’ hard-earned money will benefit their families for generations. We take that responsibility to heart every day.
Owner/Principal Dean R. Hedeker










Let’s face it,
What we want is an honest conversation with our investment advisor. We want a relationship of trust, sincerity, and honesty. A relationship where our advisor puts us first. After all, our financial wellbeing is of utmost importance to us. Our core values, wants, desires and needs are all tied up in our financial well-being. Our valued relationships with our family and others are deeply affected by our financial well-being. So, it’s important that our investment advisor considers this and above all, places our interests first.
But before we can begin on this journey of trust and honesty, we need to ask a few questions of you and truly understand you and your situation. We want to understand your background and your family.
We want to review your investment statements, your tax returns and your estate planning documents. We want to examine how your investments fit in with your taxes and your estate planning. You may be in a high tax bracket or a low one. You may have a sophisticated trust or a simple will. This all needs to be considered.
When was the last time your investment advisor asked for a copy of your tax return or even looked at your tax return? How can your investments be properly structured without knowing what your estate plan says or what your tax documents say?
In this world filled with hype and everybody promoting their latest gizmo or investment product, isn’t it important that somebody took the time to see that your investments are not only proper, but properly structured?
But the journey doesn’t end there, because as your lives change, so will your wants and needs. The investment advice will continually change as lives change.



Consistent, regular meetings are required to take advantage of the numerous financial and tax opportunities that will come your way on this journey. Questions will need to be asked and answered. Questions such as:

Are ray investments consistent with my risk tolerance?
Are my investments causing me to pay too much tax?
The tax law changed, what can I do to take advantage of the changes?
Are my investments titled properly, consistent with my estate planning?
How does creditor protection fit in with my investments?
How do I reduce the tax bill on my IRA?
How do I reduce the tax I pay on my Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)?
How do Roth Conversions work, and are they right for me?
How about paying for college expenses for my grandchildren?

Of course, there will be other questions and opportunities which will arise as time goes on.
“At Hedeker Wealth, it is not only important that your investments earn money, but that you keep the money you earn.”
Owner/Principal Dean R. Hedeker

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 08/01/2011
            

                BBB has determined that Hedeker Wealth LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
