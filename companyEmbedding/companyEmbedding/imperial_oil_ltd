Currently headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Imperial Oil was based in Toronto, Ontario, until 2005.[8]
Most of Imperial's production is from its vast natural resource holdings in the Alberta Oil sands[9] and the Norman Wells oil field in the Northwest Territories.[10]

History[edit]




Fifth Avenue Place Headquarters of Imperial Oil


The company was incorporated in London, Ontario, in 1880 (Filey 1998:62).[11] The company's association with ExxonMobil dates back to 1898 when the then-Standard Oil of New Jersey acquired controlling stake in Imperial Oil.[12]
Imperial Oil discovered the Leduc Woodbend Devonian oil reef in 1947, marking the beginning of the contemporary period in Canadian oil and gas development.[13] Drilling began on the landmark discovery well Leduc No. 1 on November 20, 1946.[13]
In 1989, Imperial Oil acquired Texaco's Canadian operations.[14]
Involvement with Hockey Night in Canada[edit]
From the 1934-35 season through the 1975-76 season, Imperial Oil was a sponsor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. program Hockey Night in Canada for both radio and television broadcasts.[15][16]
Corporate governance[edit]
In February 2013, Richard Kruger, President of ExxonMobil Production Co. and a Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corp., was appointed to be Chief Executive of Imperial Oil.[3] His predecessor, Bruce March, left to become senior vice president of global operations for ExxonMobil Chemical Co.[3]
Besides Richard Kruger, other members of the Board of Directors of Imperial Oil are Krystyna Hoeg, Jack Mintz, David Sutherland, Darren Woods, Sheelagh Whittaker and Victor Young.[4]
Retail[edit]
Imperial Oil has 1700 service stations with majority owned third parties and sold 497 stations in 2016.[17] In the late early 1990s Imperial Oil acquired retail operations from Texaco's Canadian unit Texaco Canada Incorporated.
With ExxonMobil having majority ownership, Imperial Oil uses its parent company's brands, including the Esso name for service stations, On the Run for convenience stores, and the Speedpass electronic payment system.

Imperial Oil Limited (French: L'Impériale) is a Canadian petroleum company.[2] It is Canada's second-biggest integrated oil company.[3] Exxon Mobil Corp. had a 69.6 percent ownership stake in the company as of December 31, 2012.[2] It is a significant producer of crude oil, diluted bitumen and natural gas, Canada’s major petroleum refiner, a key petrochemical producer and a national marketer with coast-to-coast supply and retail networks.[2] Its retail operations include Esso-brand service stations and On the Run/Marché Express and Tiger Express-brand convenience stores.[2][6] It is also known for its holdings in the Alberta Oil Sands.[3] Imperial owns 25 percent of Syncrude, which is one of the world’s largest oil sands operations.[2] Imperial is also in a joint venture oil sands mining operation with ExxonMobil Corp., called Kearl Oil Sands.[7]
Currently headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Imperial Oil was based in Toronto, Ontario, until 2005.[8]
Most of Imperial's production is from its vast natural resource holdings in the Alberta Oil sands[9] and the Norman Wells oil field in the Northwest Territories.[10]

History[edit]




Fifth Avenue Place Headquarters of Imperial Oil


The company was incorporated in London, Ontario, in 1880 (Filey 1998:62).[11] The company's association with ExxonMobil dates back to 1898 when the then-Standard Oil of New Jersey acquired controlling stake in Imperial Oil.[12]
Imperial Oil discovered the Leduc Woodbend Devonian oil reef in 1947, marking the beginning of the contemporary period in Canadian oil and gas development.[13] Drilling began on the landmark discovery well Leduc No. 1 on November 20, 1946.[13]
In 1989, Imperial Oil acquired Texaco's Canadian operations.[14]
Involvement with Hockey Night in Canada[edit]
From the 1934-35 season through the 1975-76 season, Imperial Oil was a sponsor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. program Hockey Night in Canada for both radio and television broadcasts.[15][16]
Corporate governance[edit]
In February 2013, Richard Kruger, President of ExxonMobil Production Co. and a Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corp., was appointed to be Chief Executive of Imperial Oil.[3] His predecessor, Bruce March, left to become senior vice president of global operations for ExxonMobil Chemical Co.[3]
Besides Richard Kruger, other members of the Board of Directors of Imperial Oil are Krystyna Hoeg, Jack Mintz, David Sutherland, Darren Woods, Sheelagh Whittaker and Victor Young.[4]
Retail[edit]
Imperial Oil has 1700 service stations with majority owned third parties and sold 497 stations in 2016.[17] In the late early 1990s Imperial Oil acquired retail operations from Texaco's Canadian unit Texaco Canada Incorporated.
With ExxonMobil having majority ownership, Imperial Oil uses its parent company's brands, including the Esso name for service stations, On the Run for convenience stores, and the Speedpass electronic payment system.

Imperial Oil Limited (French: L'Impériale) is a Canadian petroleum company.[2] It is Canada's second-biggest integrated oil company.[3] Exxon Mobil Corp. had a 69.6 percent ownership stake in the company as of December 31, 2012.[2] It is a significant producer of crude oil, diluted bitumen and natural gas, Canada’s major petroleum refiner, a key petrochemical producer and a national marketer with coast-to-coast supply and retail networks.[2] Its retail operations include Esso-brand service stations and On the Run/Marché Express and Tiger Express-brand convenience stores.[2][6] It is also known for its holdings in the Alberta Oil Sands.[3] Imperial owns 25 percent of Syncrude, which is one of the world’s largest oil sands operations.[2] Imperial is also in a joint venture oil sands mining operation with ExxonMobil Corp., called Kearl Oil Sands.[7]
Currently headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Imperial Oil was based in Toronto, Ontario, until 2005.[8]
Most of Imperial's production is from its vast natural resource holdings in the Alberta Oil sands[9] and the Norman Wells oil field in the Northwest Territories.[10]

History[edit]




Fifth Avenue Place Headquarters of Imperial Oil


The company was incorporated in London, Ontario, in 1880 (Filey 1998:62).[11] The company's association with ExxonMobil dates back to 1898 when the then-Standard Oil of New Jersey acquired controlling stake in Imperial Oil.[12]
Imperial Oil discovered the Leduc Woodbend Devonian oil reef in 1947, marking the beginning of the contemporary period in Canadian oil and gas development.[13] Drilling began on the landmark discovery well Leduc No. 1 on November 20, 1946.[13]
In 1989, Imperial Oil acquired Texaco's Canadian operations.[14]
Involvement with Hockey Night in Canada[edit]
From the 1934-35 season through the 1975-76 season, Imperial Oil was a sponsor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. program Hockey Night in Canada for both radio and television broadcasts.[15][16]
Corporate governance[edit]
In February 2013, Richard Kruger, President of ExxonMobil Production Co. and a Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corp., was appointed to be Chief Executive of Imperial Oil.[3] His predecessor, Bruce March, left to become senior vice president of global operations for ExxonMobil Chemical Co.[3]
Besides Richard Kruger, other members of the Board of Directors of Imperial Oil are Krystyna Hoeg, Jack Mintz, David Sutherland, Darren Woods, Sheelagh Whittaker and Victor Young.[4]
Retail[edit]
Imperial Oil has 1700 service stations with majority owned third parties and sold 497 stations in 2016.[17] In the late early 1990s Imperial Oil acquired retail operations from Texaco's Canadian unit Texaco Canada Incorporated.
With ExxonMobil having majority ownership, Imperial Oil uses its parent company's brands, including the Esso name for service stations, On the Run for convenience stores, and the Speedpass electronic payment system.

History[edit]




Fifth Avenue Place Headquarters of Imperial Oil


The company was incorporated in London, Ontario, in 1880 (Filey 1998:62).[11] The company's association with ExxonMobil dates back to 1898 when the then-Standard Oil of New Jersey acquired controlling stake in Imperial Oil.[12]
Imperial Oil discovered the Leduc Woodbend Devonian oil reef in 1947, marking the beginning of the contemporary period in Canadian oil and gas development.[13] Drilling began on the landmark discovery well Leduc No. 1 on November 20, 1946.[13]
In 1989, Imperial Oil acquired Texaco's Canadian operations.[14]
Involvement with Hockey Night in Canada[edit]
From the 1934-35 season through the 1975-76 season, Imperial Oil was a sponsor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. program Hockey Night in Canada for both radio and television broadcasts.[15][16]
Corporate governance[edit]
In February 2013, Richard Kruger, President of ExxonMobil Production Co. and a Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corp., was appointed to be Chief Executive of Imperial Oil.[3] His predecessor, Bruce March, left to become senior vice president of global operations for ExxonMobil Chemical Co.[3]
Besides Richard Kruger, other members of the Board of Directors of Imperial Oil are Krystyna Hoeg, Jack Mintz, David Sutherland, Darren Woods, Sheelagh Whittaker and Victor Young.[4]
Retail[edit]
Imperial Oil has 1700 service stations with majority owned third parties and sold 497 stations in 2016.[17] In the late early 1990s Imperial Oil acquired retail operations from Texaco's Canadian unit Texaco Canada Incorporated.
With ExxonMobil having majority ownership, Imperial Oil uses its parent company's brands, including the Esso name for service stations, On the Run for convenience stores, and the Speedpass electronic payment system.

Company overview















Over 130 years of industry leadership and innovation
Since 1880 Imperial has consistently demonstrated unwavering high standards, pioneering Canadian spirit, innovation and leadership in the challenging energy industry.  

While much has changed over 130-plus years, remaining true to these fundamentals has kept us at the forefront of the race to meet the world’s growing demands for energy.  Our goal is to do business in an economically, environmentally and socially responsible manner while delivering superior long-term value.  

At Imperial, we believe that we can have reliable and affordable energy, a strong economy and a clean environment, and we're committed to making it happen.

What we do

As an integrated energy company, we explore for, produce, refine and market products essential to society.

Whether it's finding oil and gas, making and selling high-quality petroleum products, or investing in innovative research, our business helps ensure Canada's quality of life and energy future. 

In our upstream business, we are contributing to reliable, affordable supplies of oil and gas for Canadians.  From coast to coast to coast we play a major role in developing Canada's oil and gas resources, investing billions of dollars to select the highest quality resources from opportunities in diverse geological and geographical environments.  

We are Canada's largest refiner of petroleum products.  We refine raw hydrocarbons into about 650 petroleum products essential to consumers and businesses: gasoline, diesel, heating oil, natural gas, lubricants, and chemicals used to make plastics.  It’s hard to imagine life without the products manufactured from hydrocarbons.  They fuel our economies, heat our homes and make our lives easier and more enjoyable.  Like you, we are concerned about the effects of chemicals on health and the environment and we have integrated Responsible Care® into our business practices.

Imperial offers these products and services to consumers across Canada as well as in export markets.  In total, we manufacture and sell about a quarter of the petroleum products used every day by Canadians.  We are a leading marketer of fuels, lubricants, asphalts and specialty products.

In addition to Imperial’s industrial and wholesale businesses, our retail brands, Esso and Mobil, are familiar fixtures across Canada. 

How we do it 
We start by hiring the best and brightest and insist on maintaining the highest standards in ethical conduct and legal compliance to bring integrity to all aspects of our business.

The safety of our workforce is a company-wide priority and is a value that guides us to strive to achieve a very simple objective – Nobody Gets Hurt.  

We apply innovative thinking and continually invest in research and technology, growth projects and the communities where we operate.

To uphold our commitment to responsible development we strictly adhere to government regulations and follow detailed management systems.  While we are pleased with our progress in our environmental performance, we know there is still more work to be done. We will not relent in our efforts to reduce the impact of our operations.

Our stakeholders have an important voice in how we conduct our business.  Open and constructive dialogue provides an understanding of the issues that concern government, community and environmental groups, Indigenous communities and the public, and it helps us collaborate on solutions. We are building long-lasting relationships with our neighbours.

We take a long-term view, drawing on best practices and decades of experience to advance projects efficiently and responsibly in phases, allowing us to incorporate new best practices and technologies. 

Standing out from the crowd: research and technology
Imperial is distinguished for its long-term commitment to research and technology. We are one of the select few energy companies in Canada with dedicated research facilities.  Scientists at our Calgary and Sarnia facilities conduct research and also partner with academic experts and scientists at ExxonMobil. Together, these efforts create better ways to recover energy resources, reduce environmental impacts and produce new or improved products for Canadians.
