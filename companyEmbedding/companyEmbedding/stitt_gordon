The Light Reading Interview
In the Spotlight: Gordon Stitt, president, CEO, and chairman, Extreme Networks


In the often staid world of networking, any company that embraces bathroom humor, encases its products in deep purple plastic, and keeps a bottle of tequila in its conference room might be labeled a bit extreme.

Of course, when the company calls itself Extreme Networks Inc. (Nasdaq: EXTR), all the above fits right in.

At the helm of this operation is longtime networking veteran Gordon Stitt, who in a previous life was a founder of Network Peripherals, a pioneer in the field of network switching. Five years ago, Stitt, along with Stephen Haddock and Herb Schneider (also Network Peripherals veterans), started Extreme, betting that Ethernet switches could do the work of routers, more quickly and at a lower cost.

So far, the company's plan has been a success, as Extreme claims to have sold product to support 3 million Ethernet ports, making it a leader in the Layer 3 switch market. But as Extreme looks to expand into new markets -- especially those outside its large-enterprise comfort zone -- Stitt might be wise to keep the salt and limes nearby.

Competitively, Extreme faces challenges from above and below. Its main foe is Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO), which Extreme says it sees head-to-head in 80 percent of its potential deals -- something like playing the Yankees four days out of five. Extreme, with just 1,000 or so employees, knows it can't be Cisco, so it must find other ways to compete with the giant.

On the startup side, Extreme has competition from Foundry Networks Inc. (Nasdaq: FDRY) and Riverstone Networks (Nasdaq: RSTN), though it faces them with confidence. Extreme's swagger is reinforced by internal marketing messages in the company's men's room – where plastic urinal screens have the words "Foundry Networks" printed on them, and a poster above the urinal proclaims: "Riverstone Networks – You're Soaking in it." (The poster also contains some product-comparison stats, as well as a warning: "Don't fall in.")

Extreme's corporate sense of humor could come in handy in the near future, as the company tries to push into tougher-sell markets (like the metro service-provider arena) while weathering the public-market meltdown.

Fiscally, Extreme will stick to its guns in not offering vendor financing, instead looking for deep-pocketed customers who are fully funded. Internally, Extreme shows restraint by  eschewing fancy espresso machines in favor of a popcorn wagon in its kitchen – more in line with what one employee calls the "cold pizza and diet coke" culture of a company named after its founder's love for extreme skiing.

The 44-year-old Stitt, who isn't afraid to wear a deep purple, logoed, button-down shirt to an interview, says he's still excited by the promise of high-speed networking, a rush that makes his job more fun than anything else he could imagine.
 
Read on as Gordon Stitt explains his extreme thinking on:
Acquisitions and Wall Street
Strategic investment and the funding crunch
Standards, the market, and the competition
Ethernet, wineries, and the future

"Why bother posting? If LR disagrees with you, they delete your post as they have many of mine"Why did they do that?  Were you posting derogatory comments, profanity etc?  You are making a very serious accusation, so you should feel obliged to back it up.

 Director’s Statement
Whether it is a stunningly crisp image of the elevated Dover Station subway stop in Boston’s South End or a darkly comic self portrait (after Velasquez’s Don Luis de Góngora); a brilliant spring Fenway landscape or a luscious still-life with apples—in all these instances Ed Stitt’s hand and eye celebrate light, offer insight, and cause us to fall in love again with the thingness of things. Stitt has assiduously documented his world for four decades, revealing afresh Back Bay and Commonwealth Avenue, Boston Public Garden, Kenmore Square, Trinity Copley, and hundreds of other beloved sites—offering us the Boston we think we know in sometimes startlingly surprising relief.
Ed Stitt studied painting with Jack Beal, Paul Rahilly, and George Nick—all influential realist painters—and completed his MFA at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. His work has been exhibited regularly at Gallery NAGA in Boston, and he has shown in New York at Tibor de Nagy and Gallery Henoch. His work is in many important private and public art collections, and his patrons have come out of the woodworks to loan these works for the retrospective.
Gordon College is grateful for the many generous loans of Ed Stitt’s works from 1976 to 2016—and we believe that this landmark exhibition for the artist will be the first chapter of the next forty years of his brilliant career!
—Bruce Herman, Gallery Director

      King, The History of the Hongkong and Shanghia Banking Corporation.
      Volume III, p. 300. 
PAGE IN PROGRESS: Updated August
      16, 2006 
Gordon H. STITT worked for the HSBC in the Far East and is another person
        connected to Sir Thomas JACKSON through links of family and geography.
        In the notes beneath - which are rather disjointed at present - I have
        included all the bits that have led me to make the connection with the
        JACKSON family. It also helped that Sir Thomas JACKSON's mother repeatedly
        suggested that her son hire Gordon STITT and also mentioned his grandfather,
        Gordon HOLMES who was the sub-inspector of police for Crossmaglen.
 Also, Elie RYDER of Bangor, Co. Down was a great help as she remembered "Uncle
        Gordie" and also recalled that he was cared for by an aunt after
        his mother died. He was known to be generous to the SPEIR (AKA SPEER)
        family of Cullyhanna - this would be his youngest sister's family. When
        he died, four gold cups were were part of what was sent to Cullyhanna
        from his estate. 



PARENTS & SIBLINGS OF Gordon Holmes STITT  
This is as far as I can get right now. The records of the first three
                  children are from Creggan Church records, the dates for Gordon
                  & Anna from other sources, and the last children are from Vital
                  Statistics. This break in the records needs more attention before
                I can be certain that I have it all correctly recorded.

This photo  is included in the first
                Album of photos at Gilford Castle. It has been generously shared
                with me by Christine WRIGHT of Gilford Castle. The inscription
                on the back of the photo reads: Mrs. Stitt of
                Derryalone (although the latter word borders on illegibility).





There is a townland named "Derryfalone", and given the loosey-goosey
        approach to spelling (a trait that I share to my personal regret), I
        shall presume that “Derryfalone” and “Derryalone” are one and the same. Other clues to go on? There is also a physical resemblance
        to Susan DONALDSON (see: CORR
        family photos as well as: DONALDSON
        family photos), but also to Mary DICKIE (see: DICKIE
        family photos) and so on. The intermarriages
        in the region - along with what appears to be a dominant gene - bequeathed
          a long face and strong chin  to many extended family members (also
        check out many of the JACKSON group). This
        being the case, using mere resemblance as a clue is pretty far fetched.
        
        Initially I thoought that this photo was of  the mother of Gordon
        STITT, but now I am leaning towards her being a DONALDSON who married
        a STITT and hence an aunt- possibly the one who raised the children when
        Gordon's mother died leaving at least ten children ranging in age from
        five years old to eighteen.        
 The residents
        of Derryfalone in the Griffiths of 1848-1864 include the following (I
        have highlighted John T. DICKIE because of his place in our family tree)

In Creggan Cemetary, there is an inscription: Here lieth the body
          of John Stitt of Freeduff who departed this life the 15th day
          of September aged 88(?) 82(?) years; also the body of his wife Letitia
          (?) Stitt who departed this life the 18 (?) day of April 1776 aged
          ... years. SOURCE: p26, Guide to Creggan Church & Graveyard by
          Kevin McMahon & Jem Murphy. 
Presumably, this is the John STITT who shows up in the 1766 Creggan
        Census.

 In the table above, I have bolded the STITT names as well as those
        of MCBRIDE and WRIGHT. According to family lore, James Francis WRIGHT
        (also of HSBC in the Far East) and later of Gilford Castle, Co. Down
        bought land from a Dr. STITT who was a
        cousin of Eilie McBRIDE’s
        father (Dr. William McBRIDE of Crossmaglen) and they inherited the two
        farms. Following along that track, there is a STITT-McBRIDE marriage
        of interest: Also one of the STITT daughters married a SPEERS - so it
        is all quite tightly connected.

One more HSBC connection to Freeduff is that Margaret Louise JACKSON,
        the widow of HSBC manager David JACKSON (d. 1903, Yokohama) lived at
        Freeduff after her second marriage and died there in 1945. After years
        of high living with a second husband, she had run through her financial
        resources (so the story goes) and had to be supported by her brother,
        James Francis WRIGHT. 
One
        last fish to net - which is likely to be a cousin - is the birth
        of a male child - last name of STITT in Crossmaglen:

Gordon H. STITT and his career with HSBC (here we are
      firmer factual ground) .


SOURCES: Archival records as well as Frank H.H.
            King, The History of the Hongkong and Shanghia Banking Corporation


STITT first went East in 1889 and I am guessing that he likely started
        in Hong Kong since he was a junior there a year later when he signed
        a thank-you letter to Sir Thomas Jackson (along with other appreciative
        juniors) . He served in Hong Kong for three years and was then assigned
        to Hiogo but apparently from 1898 to 1908 he actually served at Penang
        and Singapore. 
In July of 1896, he received a staff evaluation from G.T. HOW at Kobe
        which described him as follows:  A good worker and very steady. His
        conduct in and out of office is all I can desire – takes a great
        interest in his work and is a great favourite. In July of 1897,
        when he was in Penang, he continued to receive similar reviews for his
        work there from 1897-1900. Then, there is a gap in the record and he
        is reviewed again in Penang in 1905 with similar praise. In 1908, his
        staff performance review (again stellar) indicates that he has been serving
        as the Accountant at Penang. From there, he went to Japan where he served
        as Sub-Manager at Yokohama (then the main branch in Japan). After this,
        he  served for seven years during WWI as Manager in Kobe (from 1913-1919).
        In 1920, he was appointed Acting Manager in Shanghai during the leave
        of the current Manager (STEPHEN). When STEPHEN became Chief Manager,
        STITT "was
        appointed Manager Shanghai until his resignation in 1926 with 36 1/2
        years Eastern service. He then received a gratuity of ₤12,000 and
        a pension of ₤700
        per annum until he died in May 1949, aged 83.”
The two lions which were installed in front of the new HSBC building
        in Shanghai were named after STITT and STEPHEN:








The lion named STITT -  likely named by
                the local Chinese in appreciation for STITT's success
            with the HSBC in Shanghai.


According to James CALDWELL who worked in Shanghai in 1926, Gordon STITT
      was 

... a very jovial character who had been put there, you might
            say, as a public relations officer. He was very popular and many
            stories have been told about him, and one in particular when he was
            Agent in Kobe before he went to Shanghai in the First War. Being
            typically Irish, there was an auction to get money for some of the
            war relief funds, and he took off his Irish tweed trousers and had
            them sold at the auction. I think they went for £200,
          and he walked back to the Bank along the street in Kobe just in his
            underpants.
I was there with him at a point-to-point meeting ... he was a very keen rider
          and the ponies there were these Mongolian ponies which were very strong and
          sturdy but short, and this lady came up to him dressed in his tweeds and
          said, I think you should be ashamed of yourself with a stomach like yours,
          Mr Stitt, going to ride a little pony like that. He said, oh, the pony will
          carry me all right, don't worry about that. But if you think I'm doing anything
          about this stomach of mine, you have got another think coming. I've had so
          much fun getting it.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
