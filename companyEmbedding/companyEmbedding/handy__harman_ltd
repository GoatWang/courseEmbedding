            JOINING MATERIALS
            HANDY & HARMAN's Precious Metal activities include the fabrication of precious metal and their alloys into brazing alloys and the utilization of precious metal in precision electroplating. HANDY & HARMAN's profits from precious metal products are derived from the "value added" of processing and fabricating and not from the purchase and resale of precious metal. In accordance with general practice in the industry, prices to customers are a composite of two factors: (1) the value of the precious metal content of the product and (2) the "fabrication value", which includes the cost of base metals, labor, overhead, financing and profit. Fabricated precious metal brazing alloys are used in many industries including automotive, air conditioning, general industrial and other metal-joining industries. HANDY & HARMAN is engaged in precision electroplating (often using gold, silver, palladium and various base metals) of electronic and electrical components primarily for use for use in the automotive industry.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains certain ?forward-looking statements? within
      the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
      and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that
      reflect HNH?s current expectations and projections about its future
      results, performance, prospects, and opportunities. HNH has tried to
      identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as ?may,?
      ?should,? ?expect,? ?hope,? ?anticipate,? ?believe,? ?intend,? ?plan,?
      ?estimate,? and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements
      are based on information currently available to HNH and are subject to a
      number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause its
      actual results, performance, prospects, or opportunities in 2016 and
      beyond to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by,
      these forward-looking statements. These factors include, without
      limitation, HNH?s need for additional financing and the terms and
      conditions of any financing that is consummated, customers? acceptance
      of its new and existing products, the risk that HNH will not be able to
      compete successfully, the possible volatility of HNH?s stock price, and
      the potential fluctuation in its operating results. Although HNH
      believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking
      statements are reasonable and achievable, such statements involve
      significant risks and uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that
      the actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking
      statements. Investors should read carefully the factors described in the
      ?Risk Factors? section of HNH?s filings with the SEC, including HNH?s
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for information
      regarding risk factors that could affect HNH?s results. Except as
      otherwise required by Federal securities laws, HNH undertakes no
      obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
      whether as a result of new information, future events, changed
      circumstances, or any other reason.
