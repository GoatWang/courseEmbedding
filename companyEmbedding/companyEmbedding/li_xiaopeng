Li Xiaopeng (simplified Chinese: 李小鹏; traditional Chinese: 李小鵬; pinyin: Lǐ Xiǎopéng; July 27, 1981 in Changsha, Hunan) is a male Chinese gymnast, who specializes in parallel bars and vault. He currently holds 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China.[1] On 29 August 2009, he was the torch bearer for the torch relay of the East Asian Games in Hong Kong. He retired from the sport in late 2009.[2]

Early years[edit]
He began gymnastics training at Changsha Spare-time Sports School in Hunan Province at the age of 6 and was a member of the Hunan provincial team at 12. Li's diligence and skill soon set him apart from his peers, which could be proved by his several provincial titles. At the age of 15, he was selected into the national team.
National team[edit]
At 16, Li Xiaopeng became China's youngest world (team) gymnastics champion ever when he and his teammates won the men's team final at the 1997 Lausanne World Championships. At the same event, Li also received a silver medal for parallel bars, just second to his teammate Zhang Jingjin, and a bronze for floor exercise.
At the 1999 Tianjin World Championships, Li was part of the Chinese team to become men's team champion. Individually, he won his first gold medal in vault. However, his failure in parallel bars left something to be desired, which pushed him to train harder for the Sydney Olympics.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Li and his teammates gave an outstanding performance, earning them the gold medal at the prestigious men's team event, a first for Chinese gymnasts. Li also won an individual gold medal in parallel bars.
At the 2003 Anaheim World Championships, Li Xiaopeng was the only person to win three gold medals, namely for men's team final, vault and parallel bars. Thus he was voted as the 2003 World Gymnast of the Year.[3]
However, due to a severe foot injury, Li's performance at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games was unsatisfactory. China finished 5th at the men's team final, and Li could only get a bronze in parallel bars, after being undefeated in major competitions since 2000. He was the fourth athlete to compete in the vault event finals, but unfortunately shuffled during the initial sprint and fell on the first jump.
Li had been suffering from a chronic ankle injury and had an operation in 2005. He rested for that whole year, refraining from participating in any competitions.
In 2006, he made a successful comeback by winning a gold in parallel bars at the São Paulo World Cup Series Final. By then he had tied with his idol, China's gymnastic legend Li Ning, by winning a record of 14 world titles.[4]
In 2008, after suffering from toe injury, he came back and won titles for parallel bars at the two gymnastics World Cups, Cottbus and Tianjin.
After winning two gold medals for men's team and parallel bars at the Beijing Olympics, he surpassed Li Ning by holding 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China. He retired in late 2009.[2]

Influences[edit]
The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique has named two routines after Li. They are "Li Xiaopeng hop" in vault, and "Li Xiaopeng arm hang" in parallel bars.
Personal life[edit]
He met his future wife a Chinese-American girl Li "Angel" Anqi daughter of former gymnasts Li Xiaoping and Wen Jia at the 2003 World Championship in Anaheim, California where her father served as a host and interpreter for the Chinese team.[5] They became engaged in 2008,[6] and married in LA on June 5, 2010. The couple held a second marriage ceremony in Beijing on July 11, 2010.[5] Due to a problem with the visa of Li's parents, they were unable to attend the LA wedding ceremony. On January 12, 2012, they had their first child called Olivia (Li Xinqi). His second child, a son, was born in June 2016.[7]
Television shows[edit]
Li Xiaopeng and his daughter have been regular cast on the show "Dad came back" (version of Korean reality-variety show" Return of Superman")on which dads have to take care of their child/children without help of anyone (include their wives) in 48 hours. After the first season was aired, his daughter has gained a lot of love from public and fans. He also appears on other television shows, such as the first season of The Amazing Race China, and the 2016 Race the World (非凡搭檔), which he had to quit before the finale due to the expected birth of his second child.[8]

On January 12, 2012, they had their first child called Olivia (Li Xinqi). His second child, a son, was born in June 2016.[7]
Television shows[edit]
Li Xiaopeng and his daughter have been regular cast on the show "Dad came back" (version of Korean reality-variety show" Return of Superman")on which dads have to take care of their child/children without help of anyone (include their wives) in 48 hours. After the first season was aired, his daughter has gained a lot of love from public and fans. He also appears on other television shows, such as the first season of The Amazing Race China, and the 2016 Race the World (非凡搭檔), which he had to quit before the finale due to the expected birth of his second child.[8]

Li Xiaopeng (simplified Chinese: 李小鹏; traditional Chinese: 李小鵬; pinyin: Lǐ Xiǎopéng; July 27, 1981 in Changsha, Hunan) is a male Chinese gymnast, who specializes in parallel bars and vault. He currently holds 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China.[1] On 29 August 2009, he was the torch bearer for the torch relay of the East Asian Games in Hong Kong. He retired from the sport in late 2009.[2]

Early years[edit]
He began gymnastics training at Changsha Spare-time Sports School in Hunan Province at the age of 6 and was a member of the Hunan provincial team at 12. Li's diligence and skill soon set him apart from his peers, which could be proved by his several provincial titles. At the age of 15, he was selected into the national team.
National team[edit]
At 16, Li Xiaopeng became China's youngest world (team) gymnastics champion ever when he and his teammates won the men's team final at the 1997 Lausanne World Championships. At the same event, Li also received a silver medal for parallel bars, just second to his teammate Zhang Jingjin, and a bronze for floor exercise.
At the 1999 Tianjin World Championships, Li was part of the Chinese team to become men's team champion. Individually, he won his first gold medal in vault. However, his failure in parallel bars left something to be desired, which pushed him to train harder for the Sydney Olympics.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Li and his teammates gave an outstanding performance, earning them the gold medal at the prestigious men's team event, a first for Chinese gymnasts. Li also won an individual gold medal in parallel bars.
At the 2003 Anaheim World Championships, Li Xiaopeng was the only person to win three gold medals, namely for men's team final, vault and parallel bars. Thus he was voted as the 2003 World Gymnast of the Year.[3]
However, due to a severe foot injury, Li's performance at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games was unsatisfactory. China finished 5th at the men's team final, and Li could only get a bronze in parallel bars, after being undefeated in major competitions since 2000. He was the fourth athlete to compete in the vault event finals, but unfortunately shuffled during the initial sprint and fell on the first jump.
Li had been suffering from a chronic ankle injury and had an operation in 2005. He rested for that whole year, refraining from participating in any competitions.
In 2006, he made a successful comeback by winning a gold in parallel bars at the São Paulo World Cup Series Final. By then he had tied with his idol, China's gymnastic legend Li Ning, by winning a record of 14 world titles.[4]
In 2008, after suffering from toe injury, he came back and won titles for parallel bars at the two gymnastics World Cups, Cottbus and Tianjin.
After winning two gold medals for men's team and parallel bars at the Beijing Olympics, he surpassed Li Ning by holding 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China. He retired in late 2009.[2]

Influences[edit]
The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique has named two routines after Li. They are "Li Xiaopeng hop" in vault, and "Li Xiaopeng arm hang" in parallel bars.
Personal life[edit]
He met his future wife a Chinese-American girl Li "Angel" Anqi daughter of former gymnasts Li Xiaoping and Wen Jia at the 2003 World Championship in Anaheim, California where her father served as a host and interpreter for the Chinese team.[5] They became engaged in 2008,[6] and married in LA on June 5, 2010. The couple held a second marriage ceremony in Beijing on July 11, 2010.[5] Due to a problem with the visa of Li's parents, they were unable to attend the LA wedding ceremony. On January 12, 2012, they had their first child called Olivia (Li Xinqi). His second child, a son, was born in June 2016.[7]

Li Xiaopeng (simplified Chinese: 李小鹏; traditional Chinese: 李小鵬; pinyin: Lǐ Xiǎopéng; July 27, 1981 in Changsha, Hunan) is a male Chinese gymnast, who specializes in parallel bars and vault. He currently holds 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China.[1] On 29 August 2009, he was the torch bearer for the torch relay of the East Asian Games in Hong Kong. He retired from the sport in late 2009.[2]

Early years[edit]
He began gymnastics training at Changsha Spare-time Sports School in Hunan Province at the age of 6 and was a member of the Hunan provincial team at 12. Li's diligence and skill soon set him apart from his peers, which could be proved by his several provincial titles. At the age of 15, he was selected into the national team.
National team[edit]
At 16, Li Xiaopeng became China's youngest world (team) gymnastics champion ever when he and his teammates won the men's team final at the 1997 Lausanne World Championships. At the same event, Li also received a silver medal for parallel bars, just second to his teammate Zhang Jingjin, and a bronze for floor exercise.
At the 1999 Tianjin World Championships, Li was part of the Chinese team to become men's team champion. Individually, he won his first gold medal in vault. However, his failure in parallel bars left something to be desired, which pushed him to train harder for the Sydney Olympics.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Li and his teammates gave an outstanding performance, earning them the gold medal at the prestigious men's team event, a first for Chinese gymnasts. Li also won an individual gold medal in parallel bars.
At the 2003 Anaheim World Championships, Li Xiaopeng was the only person to win three gold medals, namely for men's team final, vault and parallel bars. Thus he was voted as the 2003 World Gymnast of the Year.[3]
However, due to a severe foot injury, Li's performance at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games was unsatisfactory. China finished 5th at the men's team final, and Li could only get a bronze in parallel bars, after being undefeated in major competitions since 2000. He was the fourth athlete to compete in the vault event finals, but unfortunately shuffled during the initial sprint and fell on the first jump.
Li had been suffering from a chronic ankle injury and had an operation in 2005. He rested for that whole year, refraining from participating in any competitions.
In 2006, he made a successful comeback by winning a gold in parallel bars at the São Paulo World Cup Series Final. By then he had tied with his idol, China's gymnastic legend Li Ning, by winning a record of 14 world titles.[4]
In 2008, after suffering from toe injury, he came back and won titles for parallel bars at the two gymnastics World Cups, Cottbus and Tianjin.
After winning two gold medals for men's team and parallel bars at the Beijing Olympics, he surpassed Li Ning by holding 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China. He retired in late 2009.[2]

Influences[edit]
The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique has named two routines after Li. They are "Li Xiaopeng hop" in vault, and "Li Xiaopeng arm hang" in parallel bars.
Personal life[edit]
He met his future wife a Chinese-American girl Li "Angel" Anqi daughter of former gymnasts Li Xiaoping and Wen Jia at the 2003 World Championship in Anaheim, California where her father served as a host and interpreter for the Chinese team.[5] They became engaged in 2008,[6] and married in LA on June 5, 2010. The couple held a second marriage ceremony in Beijing on July 11, 2010.[5] Due to a problem with the visa of Li's parents, they were unable to attend the LA wedding ceremony. On January 12, 2012, they had their first child called Olivia (Li Xinqi). His second child, a son, was born in June 2016.[7]
Television shows[edit]
Li Xiaopeng and his daughter have been regular cast on the show "Dad came back" (version of Korean reality-variety show" Return of Superman")on which dads have to take care of their child/children without help of anyone (include their wives) in 48 hours. After the first season was aired, his daughter has gained a lot of love from public and fans. He also appears on other television shows, such as the first season of The Amazing Race China, and the 2016 Race the World (非凡搭檔), which he had to quit before the finale due to the expected birth of his second child.[8]

Influences[edit]
The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique has named two routines after Li. They are "Li Xiaopeng hop" in vault, and "Li Xiaopeng arm hang" in parallel bars.
Personal life[edit]
He met his future wife a Chinese-American girl Li "Angel" Anqi daughter of former gymnasts Li Xiaoping and Wen Jia at the 2003 World Championship in Anaheim, California where her father served as a host and interpreter for the Chinese team.[5] They became engaged in 2008,[6] and married in LA on June 5, 2010. The couple held a second marriage ceremony in Beijing on July 11, 2010.[5] Due to a problem with the visa of Li's parents, they were unable to attend the LA wedding ceremony. On January 12, 2012, they had their first child called Olivia (Li Xinqi). His second child, a son, was born in June 2016.[7]
Television shows[edit]
Li Xiaopeng and his daughter have been regular cast on the show "Dad came back" (version of Korean reality-variety show" Return of Superman")on which dads have to take care of their child/children without help of anyone (include their wives) in 48 hours. After the first season was aired, his daughter has gained a lot of love from public and fans. He also appears on other television shows, such as the first season of The Amazing Race China, and the 2016 Race the World (非凡搭檔), which he had to quit before the finale due to the expected birth of his second child.[8]

Li Xiaopeng (simplified Chinese: 李小鹏; traditional Chinese: 李小鵬; pinyin: Lǐ Xiǎopéng; July 27, 1981 in Changsha, Hunan) is a male Chinese gymnast, who specializes in parallel bars and vault. He currently holds 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China.[1] On 29 August 2009, he was the torch bearer for the torch relay of the East Asian Games in Hong Kong. He retired from the sport in late 2009.[2]

Early years[edit]
He began gymnastics training at Changsha Spare-time Sports School in Hunan Province at the age of 6 and was a member of the Hunan provincial team at 12. Li's diligence and skill soon set him apart from his peers, which could be proved by his several provincial titles. At the age of 15, he was selected into the national team.
National team[edit]
At 16, Li Xiaopeng became China's youngest world (team) gymnastics champion ever when he and his teammates won the men's team final at the 1997 Lausanne World Championships. At the same event, Li also received a silver medal for parallel bars, just second to his teammate Zhang Jingjin, and a bronze for floor exercise.
At the 1999 Tianjin World Championships, Li was part of the Chinese team to become men's team champion. Individually, he won his first gold medal in vault. However, his failure in parallel bars left something to be desired, which pushed him to train harder for the Sydney Olympics.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Li and his teammates gave an outstanding performance, earning them the gold medal at the prestigious men's team event, a first for Chinese gymnasts. Li also won an individual gold medal in parallel bars.
At the 2003 Anaheim World Championships, Li Xiaopeng was the only person to win three gold medals, namely for men's team final, vault and parallel bars. Thus he was voted as the 2003 World Gymnast of the Year.[3]
However, due to a severe foot injury, Li's performance at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games was unsatisfactory. China finished 5th at the men's team final, and Li could only get a bronze in parallel bars, after being undefeated in major competitions since 2000. He was the fourth athlete to compete in the vault event finals, but unfortunately shuffled during the initial sprint and fell on the first jump.
Li had been suffering from a chronic ankle injury and had an operation in 2005. He rested for that whole year, refraining from participating in any competitions.
In 2006, he made a successful comeback by winning a gold in parallel bars at the São Paulo World Cup Series Final. By then he had tied with his idol, China's gymnastic legend Li Ning, by winning a record of 14 world titles.[4]
In 2008, after suffering from toe injury, he came back and won titles for parallel bars at the two gymnastics World Cups, Cottbus and Tianjin.
After winning two gold medals for men's team and parallel bars at the Beijing Olympics, he surpassed Li Ning by holding 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China. He retired in late 2009.[2]

Expected to build on existing strategies, skills and businesses of the Boots & Alliance UniChem Group.Reasons For MergerTo capitalise on the increasing demand for healthcare and beauty productsTo create Europe’s leading retail pharmacy businessTo enhance international growth opportunities in new marketsTo deliver annual pre-tax cost savings of at least £100 millionMore On The MergerThe merger was predicted to lead to about a 1,000 job losses for the enlarged group.Before the merger, Boots had been facing stiff competition from major competitors Tesco & Asda.Boots had also been experiencing and issues 3 profit warnings, over the 18 months prior to the merger talks.Boots profits had fallen 11% and warned of further difficulty in trading.More On The Merger (2)The merger caused various changes, one of which was a change in management and the increased recognition of a man named Stefano Pessina.He was appointed in July 2007 and is still currently the Executive Chairman of Alliance Boots.Prior to the merger, Stefano Pessina was the executive deputy chairman of Alliance UniChem.Planned ChangeLewin – facilitate learning to help individuals understand change (Burnes, 2009).Evaluation - strategy must be (Stacey, 2007):acceptable feasible (financially, human resources)Suitable – has strategic logicMust align strategy with foreseeable culture (Stacey, 2007).Stages in Planned Approach3 stages involved (Lewin, 1958 cited in Balogun & Hailey, 2008)-Unfreezing: Instilling readiness for change at all levels of the firm by destabilising inertia. -Moving: Implementing change through levers of change-Refreezing: institutionalising the changesForce field analysisfile:///E:/HR%20masters/Material/Work%20Org.%20&%20Change%20BHM%20830/Google%20Image%20Forcefield%20analysis_files/ForceFieldAnalysis.htmDriving ForcesPre-tax cost savingsSynergy – sharing costs, knowledge, skills, economies of scaleClear vision for the future - Market dominanceGeographic expansionEffective structures for communication in placeSupport of change from top managementDriving ForcesCompetitive landscape encourages change (BBC News Online, 2012).

Steffano Pessina who made his business grow to the multinational Alliance Unichem-Hosftede studyPower distance indexuncertainty avoidance indexhttp://geert-hofstede.com/italy.htmlStrategies used to minimise adverse consequences - Can be argued that Alliance Boots utilised Lewin’s ‘Unfreeze, Change, Freeze’ model, as part of their strategy to minimize any adverse consequences of the changes.  – Gradual Introduction of the changes.  – Consultation of employees completed as early as possible. (Preparing them in order to make them understand the need for change – Lewin’s model – Unfreeze.) - Support offered to employees throughout the transition period. (For example the Pensions Helpline.)  - Employees kept informed as much as possible in order to make them feel involved, and ultimately to maintain motivation levels and productivity, without creating discontent and uncertainty.- The existing family-oriented culture throughout the org. arguably assisted in minimise negative repercussions, as employees supported each other throughout the turbulent transition period. - A greater focus put on non-financial methods of motivating employees. (Creative recognition programmes, team building, charity fun days.)- More innovative reward techniques used to motivate staff and save money for the organisation. (Advantage card points given as reward, ‘Red Carpet’ parking spaces, ‘shooting stars’ peer recognition scheme.)How successful has change been in Alliance Boots?Evidence relating to HR- Boots UK and Boots Opticians have both been awarded places in The Sunday Times 2012 25 Best Big Companies to Work For list.Nearly half of all 63,000 Boots UK heritage employees (30,611) have worked for Boots for over 5 years as of March 2011. (Suggests that employees are sticking with the company throughout change.)Alliance Boots Great Place to work survey reports in 2011 an improved employee engagement level of 81% However As of May 2012, over 100 Pharmacists have begun tribunal proceedings against Alliance Boots UK, relating to the cutting of Sunday Pay in stores as part of the organisations change initiative.  Evidence relating to the company as a wholeFor the year ending 31st March 2012, Alliance Boots profits have increased by 12.4%This suggests that the strategic changes implemented by Alliance Boots, including the mergers of Boots UK Ltd, Alliance Pharmacies, and Unichem have been a success overall. The fact that the organisation has been able to improve financial performance considering the recession, and the recession hit retail industry within which it operates, suggests that the changes have been correct and successful.Ansoff MatrixMarket development:Merger plays to the strengths of both parties to the merger – achieve market dominance, geographic expansion, adjustment to competitionStyle of ChangeNew company formed, therefore Corporate TransformationTowardsIncremental adjustment to conditions based on emergent change.DirectiveTowardsConsultative – informed staff of need for change without enough time for full collaborationSteps to successful change1.

He believed that groups are constantly adapting to the forces in the field“if one could identify, plot and establish the potency of these forces, then it would be possible not only to understand why individuals, groups and behaviours behave as they do, but also what forces would need to be diminished or strengthened in order to bring about change” (Burnes, 2009)Strategies used to minimise adverse consequencesAfter changeBefore changeBoots before the mergerBoots grew from a single herbalist shop in Nottingham, founded by John Boot in 1849.It’s strong family background has been a fundamental element of the organisation’s culture, with it’s head offices still located in Nottingham. As a result, Boots heritage organisation had a feminine culture, with a strong emphasis on moral conduct and human relationships.  The organisation has always had a strong focus on staff well-being."when we build factories in which it is a joy to work, when we establish pension funds which relieve our workers of fears for their old age, when we reduce the number of working days in the week, or give long holidays with pay to our retail assistant, we are setting a standard which Governments in due time will be able to make universal"John Boot, 1938Reference listAllianceBoots Annual Report (2010/2011), p. 1-113AllianceBoots Online (2012).

Early life and career[edit]
Li was born in June 1959, at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, the son of Li Peng, an electrical engineer, and Zhu Lin, a Russian-language translator. Li was the eldest child of his parents. His sister, Li Xiaolin, was born two years later. Both children were named after their parents by simply appending the middle character xiao to their names (literally meaning "little"), so Li Xiaopeng's name can be taken to mean "little Li Peng" or "Li Peng, Jr.". Both Li Xiaopeng and Li Xiaolin took after their father and studied electricity-related professions in university. He is a graduate of the North China Electric Power University.
In 1982, Li found work at the country's top institute specializing in the study of power generation. He was rapidly promoted in the institute and earned his professional engineer designation. He studied for a brief stint at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. In 1991, Li entered a company specializing in power generation, and became assistant to its chief executive, beginning his career in business. He took up increasingly senior executive positions. In April 1999 Li Xiaopeng was named chief executive of China Huaneng Group. He took the company to its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange a year later. After some mergers and acquisitions, China Huaneng emerged as one of the largest power generation companies in Asia. Li Xiaopeng was nicknamed the "Asian King of Power". In 2002, Li was named chief executive of Huaneng Power International. Huaneng consistently ranked first in the "big five" state-owned power generation companies in China in terms of generation capacity.
Shanxi[edit]
In May 2008, Li was named to the Party Standing Committee of Shanxi province, joining the elite council of politicians in the province. In less than a month, on June 12, Li was named Vice-Governor of Shanxi, his portfolio included commerce, market regulation, foreign affairs, and tourism.[1] In June 2010, Li was named Executive Vice-Governor. In December 2012, Li Xiaopeng was named acting Governor of Shanxi, replacing Wang Jun, who went on to become party chief of neighbouring Inner Mongolia.[1][2] Li Xiaopeng's term as Governor has been marked with instability in the provincial party organization; between 2013 and 2014, several senior provincial officials fell as part of a corruption probe.
In January 2015, the Shanxi government website made changes to the "division of labour" among the highest officers of the provincial government, reducing Li's purview to only "oversee overall work of the provincial government." It was generally considered customary for the governor to also directly oversee the departments for supervision, audit, and state owned enterprise management (guoziwei), which is typically defined explicitly on the websites. Outside observers saw this move as an indication that Li Xiaopeng's power had been curtailed. During his governorship, he welcomed two new party secretaries, Wang Rulin and Luo Huining, while unable to ascend to the post of provincial party chief himself as was customarily expected in other Chinese provinces.[3]
Li is an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he is ranked last on the list, which is arranged by votes received in favour at the 18th Party Congress.
Minister of Transport[edit]
In September 2016, Li Xiaopeng was appointed as the Minister of Transport by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and replaced Yang Chuantang.[4]

Early life and career[edit]
Li was born in June 1959, at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, the son of Li Peng, an electrical engineer, and Zhu Lin, a Russian-language translator. Li was the eldest child of his parents. His sister, Li Xiaolin, was born two years later. Both children were named after their parents by simply appending the middle character xiao to their names (literally meaning "little"), so Li Xiaopeng's name can be taken to mean "little Li Peng" or "Li Peng, Jr.". Both Li Xiaopeng and Li Xiaolin took after their father and studied electricity-related professions in university. He is a graduate of the North China Electric Power University.
In 1982, Li found work at the country's top institute specializing in the study of power generation. He was rapidly promoted in the institute and earned his professional engineer designation. He studied for a brief stint at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. In 1991, Li entered a company specializing in power generation, and became assistant to its chief executive, beginning his career in business. He took up increasingly senior executive positions. In April 1999 Li Xiaopeng was named chief executive of China Huaneng Group. He took the company to its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange a year later. After some mergers and acquisitions, China Huaneng emerged as one of the largest power generation companies in Asia. Li Xiaopeng was nicknamed the "Asian King of Power". In 2002, Li was named chief executive of Huaneng Power International. Huaneng consistently ranked first in the "big five" state-owned power generation companies in China in terms of generation capacity.
Shanxi[edit]
In May 2008, Li was named to the Party Standing Committee of Shanxi province, joining the elite council of politicians in the province. In less than a month, on June 12, Li was named Vice-Governor of Shanxi, his portfolio included commerce, market regulation, foreign affairs, and tourism.[1] In June 2010, Li was named Executive Vice-Governor. In December 2012, Li Xiaopeng was named acting Governor of Shanxi, replacing Wang Jun, who went on to become party chief of neighbouring Inner Mongolia.[1][2] Li Xiaopeng's term as Governor has been marked with instability in the provincial party organization; between 2013 and 2014, several senior provincial officials fell as part of a corruption probe.
In January 2015, the Shanxi government website made changes to the "division of labour" among the highest officers of the provincial government, reducing Li's purview to only "oversee overall work of the provincial government."
