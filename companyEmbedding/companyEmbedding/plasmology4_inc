The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Position Statement














Orthopedic Research & Education
Position Statement
A position statement from The CORE Institute regarding relationships with medical device companies
Recently, you may have heard that the Federal Government completed inquiries into the practices of several large orthopedic device manufacturing companies.  Although The CORE Institute was not involved in any of those investigations, we would like to make sure you have accurate information regarding our relationships with some of these companies.
As our name suggests, our physicians, engineers, scientists and graduate students are actively involved in clinical care, education and orthopedic research.  Because of our mission, we focus our recruitment efforts on physicians who have superior academic and clinical training, and who also are actively involved in orthopedic research and education directed at advancing orthopedic surgery and improving patient outcomes.  Information about our physicians' education, training and experience can be accessed on our website at www.thecoreinstitute.com.
Our Division of Research and Development and our partnership with The Sun Health Research Institute allow us to be actively involved in laboratory research aimed at improving the quality of medical care.  We are currently working on projects studying total knee replacement devices; ways to improve hip fracture implants; improved methods of fracture treatment; and release of antibiotics from implants in an attempt to reduce the risk of post-operative infections.  We are very proud of our success in this field and believe that we have contributed to the improvement in the care of orthopedic conditions. 
Because of the qualifications of our physicians and other professionals, we often are approached by companies involved in the development of medical devices, instruments and related equipment.  The companies know that our physicians have invaluable hands-on experience in the treatment of orthopedic problems, and that orthopedic surgeons frequently make important contributions to the development and improvement of devices and other equipment used in the treatment of orthopedic conditions.  Surgeons and researchers at The CORE Institute are currently working with at least half a dozen companies, both large and very small, to help them create and improve products for patient care.  We also have developed and patented products of our own that we have and/or will license or sell to industry. 
Although CORE physicians donate a great deal of their time to the advancement of orthopedic research and education, they also enter into contracts that provide payment for some of their efforts.  Payment for the services provided by orthopedic surgeons may come in the form of hourly consulting fees for services provided by the physicians; royalties based on sales of products to which CORE physicians made important contributions (excluding sales of products used on our patients); and/or outright purchase of technologies.  All of these transactions are compliant with all federal and state laws.
The following is a current list of the CORE physicians who have contractual relationships with device manufacturers, and the companies with whom they have those relationships:
