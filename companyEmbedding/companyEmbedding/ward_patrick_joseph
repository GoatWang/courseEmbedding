                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA.

            Joseph Patrick Ward
December 14, 1929 - July 12, 2017

San Francisco native Joseph Patrick Ward died peacefully at home on July 12, 2017 at the age of 87. He was born December 14, 1929 of Irish immigrant parents, Patrick and Katherine (Walsh) Ward. He is survived by his wife Margaret Ann (O'Callaghan) of 57 years, and four sons, Patrick (Christine), Matthew (Mari), Stephen (Melissa), and David (Vicky). He is also survived by his two grandchildren Christopher and Mariana Ward, his sister Patricia D'Arcy and many nieces and nephews. Joe was predeceased by his brother Jim Ward.  

Joe grew up in Potrero Hill and attended St. Peter's. After high school, he joined the Coast Guard. He then joined the SF Police Department and was an officer for 9 years before joining SF Fire Department for the next 21 years.   

There will be a mass on Tuesday, July 18, 2017 at St. Finn Barr Church at 11:00 a.m., followed by a reception at the United Irish Cultural Center. His ashes will be buried at Holy Cross. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to The SFFD Toy Program.
