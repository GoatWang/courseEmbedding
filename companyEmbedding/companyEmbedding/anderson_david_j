Getting to “pull” at enterprise level: What gets in the way?

by David Anderson | November 7, 2016 | ESP, Kanban | 0 Comments In part 1 and  part 2 of this blog series, I discussed how organizations benefit from Kanban but leave much value on the table by not embracing its full potential. Making the changes to implement a true enterprise-wide pull system is very possible so what is getting in the way of progress?

Getting to “pull” at enterprise level: Why is it so hard?

by David Anderson | November 4, 2016 | ESP, Kanban | 0 Comments In part 1 of this series I described the incredible benefits that Kanban is providing to organizations around the world.  I asserted that far greater gains could be achieved if only Kanban initiatives were fully embraced and moved to a deeper level of “pull” at enterprise scale.
But how do we even know if we are achieving a complete pull system or not?

Reviews Anyone who is serious about coaching Kanban as a method for organizational change should read this book. It will allow you to avoid some likely pitfalls and it will guide you to asking, yourself and your clients, the right questions. Though many people focus on the visualization techniques in Kanban the true value only emerges when you, as a kanban system manager, are apt at noticing the anti-patterns that occur on the kanban board and are able to take appropriate actions. David generously shares his vast experience in this field, with plenty real case scenarios, to the benefit of the reader. After reading this book I toyed with the idea: Would I've changed my approach to coaching my previous clients, in their adoption of agile values and practices, had I read this at the time? Well, I certainly would have, for all of them, and I'm sure it would have meant a smoother change process for the agilely challenged organizations. David provides a comprehensive guide to implementing Kanban in a software development/maintenance environment. Covering the mechanics, dynamics, principles and rationale behind why Kanban is a so promising framework for managing the work of a variety of teams and groups and being an evolutionary-based change management driver. Kanban is the practical approach to implement Lean Software Development, and this book is the practical guide for how to start using Kanban, and how to adapt the system for advanced needs. The book is clear and flowing, even though it covers some quite technical material. I would recommend it to Development managers, Project/Program managers, Agile Coaches/Consultants. It addresses concerns/needs of Novice as well as those already familiar with Kanban and looking for advanced answers. Even if you don't intend to implement a kanban system, there are a lot of techniques and ideas that are easily applicable to any product development/maintenance environment, agile or not. Bottom line, highly recommended.

What do you do if that's a major portion of your day-to-day work?David Anderson has laid out his experience in how to use a very different approach to make workloads visible, limit what's in progress to expose bottlenecks, focus on improving quality, reducing waste, improving predictability, and increasing trust with stakeholders and overall organizational maturity.It's a dense book there's lots of goodness packed into it. It's also the first (certainly that I've read) that's shown how Kanban can be a complete approach to all software work.I very strongly recommend this book. It's a permanent reference on my desk now, and I'm helping a shop of about 50 developers move from Waterfall/cowboy to agile in the face of almost no agreement - their a stodgy lot! But by using Kanban, it's working, and we're seeing improvements and buy-in as people realize the benefits of not being hated by their stakeholders and actually getting home on time!

I could feel my brain getting bigger while I read this book. I agree with the author when he claims that Kanban is the first real major innovation in Agile Software Development in 10 years. This book gave me enough new ideas that I can't wait to get back to work to implement them!

Hi. I'm a software developer. I've been writing software professionally for more than 15 years now. One of my favorite books about the practice of software development for business is Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck , which refreshingly upended a lot of conventional wisdom about software development, focusing effort on activities that add value for customers. In the intervening years, many of the practices promoted in that book have become commonplace, mostly notably test driven development. Extreme Programming itself never really got much traction, but many of its ideas were taken up by a family of practices more generally known as "agile". "Agile" itself remains somewhat controversial while also becoming so general that it's not quite clear what it means anymore. Scrum, the most popular flavour of agile, took a lot of the extreme programming practices for organizing teams and placed emphasis on commitment. Scrum-style sprints are commonplace. You guys all know this stuff though. I don't know why I'm even typing it!So, this is the environment that produced Kanban, which is a fusion of agile methods and lean management principles. The last place I worked used some Scrum, but honestly, most of the management wasn't really up-to-speed on the finer points of Scrum and tended to rely on experience and organizational inertia to set policies, so it's hard to say that what we were doing was Scrum. Compared to that environment, however, I see a lot to like in Kanban. A basic principle of Kanban is that work-in-progress is limited to a fixed number of items, in order to reduce complexity and increase the predictability of delivery and therefore shorten lead times. One of the effects of this is to highlight bottlenecks, as it is plain to everyone exactly where in the process work is piling up. Then, idle resources (that is, people) can change processes to help work to move through the bottleneck more quickly. This Kanban book takes extremely high quality as measured in defects and test coverage as something of a given and focuses on work exactly one level up from there. It is assume that the dev. team knows how to do their work, but that they are in danger of being tasked with too much unimportant work. The author discusses what happens on teams very little, and devotes a lot of space to how work is prioritized between different groups within an organization.Talking about all of this with a helpful colleague recently, he pointed out that all of these methodologies require organizations to have discipline. Managers from top-to-bottom have to be able to make plans and follow through on them, and tirelessly ensure that their efforts align with customer needs. If you can do that, you will be able to implement any of the agile methodologies with success. Without it, you can't implement anything. I can see how something like Kanban can be used to gradually increase trust and communication in an organization until that kind of discipline is achieved, but I've never ever seen this actually happen. Does it ever happen?I don't mean any of this to be negative, though. There's a lot to like in Kanban. Anderson dispenses with estimation of tasks by and large, replacing it with statistical averages. For a given team, he says, a development task will take between n and m days p percent of the time, e.g., from 1 to 3 days 90% of the time, which is really all the information a management team needs for planning if lead times are short enough. Anderson also eliminates iterations or sprints, which made sense when integration and deployment and planning of the next unit of work were expensive activities. Decoupling deployment from features completion and planning enables a continuous development cadence. Anderson also emphasizes trust instead of commitment. A great deal of the success of a Kanban team seems to stem from the ability of the team to self-organize based on the visualization of the flow of work and the policies.Separating Kanban the methodology from the book for a moment, well, I think there will be a much better, more approachable book about Kanban sometime in the future, but whoever writes it will probably call the methodology something else in order to control their own brand. That is what I predict.

Несколько полезных идей есть, но о них скучно читать, нужно пробовать на практике. В остальном такие книги выглядят как вода-вода-вода-используйте стикеры разного цвета-а вот мы в 2005 году добились таких цифр!-спринты-agile-кайдзен-вода.

An excellent guide to implementing a kanban system for software delivery, with my preferred mix of theoretical background and practical lessons. Despite having a comic on the cover, this is a pretty serious book with an intended audience of individuals fairly experienced with project management.

An excellent guide to implementing a kanban system for software delivery, with my preferred mix of theoretical background and practical lessons. Despite having a comic on the cover, this is a pretty serious book with an intended audience of individuals fairly experienced with project management. I read this having worked on a few projects that used kanban but had left me with the open question: how do you go from X to kanban? And this book provides sound answers to that question. Highly recommended.

I am a software developer myself and find this an incredibly, I hope, empowering book. A nerve wracking read, every page mentions problems, solutions and ways of thinking that hit close to home. I'm left almost paralysed with ideas I'd like to try infiltrate into my company.

The main reason of this is that all the summarized principles in the Guide will be very developed here, (a need if you want to implement Kanban Method in a real context) but you will be more prepared to follow them due the lack of well content organization. Too much merge of very extense examples between concepts.The good part is that is a complete developed info with real management utility, with a lot of referred and covered sources and a very good approach to another way to adopt Agility besides Scrum. Read the book, mark and work in your own highlights, and then look for actual cases and real implementations nowadays. Then, try for yourself, fail and improve.

Nevertheless a book I can recommend to anyone working in the software business.

The book is easy to read. Examples and stories turn abstractions into easy to understand ideas.It is definitely a worthwhile read for everyone, as it defines many points of improvement, applicable in any type of business.My takeaways:- proper and clear visualisation is the key;- keep it easy, do not rush it;- you need the support and understanding of your team to push an improvement.

Comprehensive guide to the Kanban framework for delivery software. Plenty (long-winded) anecdotes to demonstrate how different theories have been applied in David's wisdom and experience. Thorough outline though with plenty to learn from, especially as a noob to the world of Kanban.

The writing can be a bit dull, the examples a bit too verbose, but this book contains a thorough description of Kanban, one of the newer techniques for agile software management.Kanban for software development descends from the broader lean traditions that have been gaining greater prominence in the world of agile software. Lean in general, and Kanban in particular, focuses on the idea that there is not one best process that works for all teams. As such, Kanban is not a software development methodology -- it is a change management methodology. The tools of Kanban help teams figure out how they can customize their processes to improve their performance. Kanban flips the question from "How can we get more done?" to "What is blocking our ability to get more done?"At the heart of Kanban (although not sufficient on its own) is work in progress limits. Limiting the work in progress to get more done may seem counterintuitive. The value of these limits flow from the assumption that the gains to be had from improving the process are greater than the productivity lost by not having everyone fully loaded all of the time. This plays out in several ways.First, limiting the work in progress forces teams to acknowledge the parts of their process that are bottlenecks. Without strict limits, the parts of the process that are not bottlenecks can keep taking on more and more work, causing it to pile up once it gets to the bottleneck. With strict limits, the problems become obvious.Limiting the work in progress forces teams to deal with blocked work items. Without strict limits, it is easy to let blockers delay the completion of a task for a long time. First, the part of the team not responsible for the task is not motivated to deal with the blocker because they can just ignore it. Second, the task owner may also not deal with the block as quickly as they might otherwise because they have other tasks to work on. When the work in progress is limited, blocks have to be addressed.Limiting the work in progress optimizes for latency over throughput. Many teams aim to get tasks done as quickly as possible. In practice, urgent (but not necessarily more important) items tend to jump into the work queue as soon as they come up, and people juggle multiple projects. Limiting the work in progress forces a conversation about priorities: Do we have to take on this task right away, or can it be on the top of our list of things to tackle next? If we have to work on it right away and we're already working at our limit, what can we drop? (Note that this sort of dropping is already common at an individual level. However, it's not necessarily communicated to the team or the external stakeholders which leads to mismatched expectations about when work will get done.)Finally, limiting parallel work decreases task switching overhead, both at the individual and team level. At the individual level, too much parallelism can make people feel overwhelmed. "Too much" varies from person to person, but everyone has a limit. At the team level, too much parallelism fragments knowledge and/or leads to higher communication overhead since people have to share a larger amount of context whenever they solicit input from someone working an unrelated task.Of course, just limiting the work in progress on its own does not make things better. The bulk of Anderson's book describes other concepts needed to effectively monitor and improve a development process. A mature Kanban system has a lot of pieces -- pieces that can make it look a lot like a development process -- but the key to remember is that these mature systems developed by adding and tweaking and removing process as it was shown to be needed by the problems they had in practice. While teams with a mature process derived using Kanban may have some similar best practices, part of the power of this system is making sure that those practices evolved based on the needs of the team. These practices shouldn't be adopted without thought -- and if they are, they'll likely fail.

Along the way, it shows how this can drive better working practices and efficiency and brings in Theory of Constraints as well as ideas from Agile methodologies, and briefly Six Sigma, as well.It does have some problems in structure - it's a bit repetitive, including the details of some examples more than once; this is a plus point if you're dipping in and out of the book, but annoying if reading it cover to cover. Also, for a book that's all about visual management, I felt it took way too long to get to a concrete visual example, and when it did get too them, the examples are some fairly indistinct photographs of Kanban walls - it could really do with more examples, much earlier, and probably as exemplary diagrams rather than necessary photos of real world walls. The book also seems to just abruptly end without ever wrapping up in an overall conclusion.Still and all, some really good ideas in here, and well worth a read for anyone who is looking to improve their development methods, particularly if you've avoided Agile through wariness of the amount of change management involved in introducing a wholesale new methodology.

I learned a lot from reading this book, but the presentation sometimes made it harder than it could have. Some of the anecdotes were longer than I would have liked, and very well focused sections were mixed in with ones that rambled a bit. This would have been a much better book had the author either kept the anecdotes briefer, or started the longer anecdotes with some more guidance about what we might expect to learn from the subsequent story. If you are willing to skim a bit (and occasionally backtrack) you can get a lot of value from this book if you want to learn about Kanban. This is a good book. It could have been a much better one.

In the absence of information I can only guess that Kanban takes a lot of discipline and buy-in in order to execute well and Anderson's replacement didn't see the value.The dream of Kanban sounds great: if everyone has visibility into the workflow then the various interests in an organization will work together! It's a lot harder to be adversarial and claim "It's that other department's fault" when your clearly-mapped out workflow shows that to be false. And if you are, in fact, what is holding up work it's immediately and wordlessly obvious to you (and everyone else) at the same time. It is the difference between doing a group 'Biggest Loser'-type competition vs having someone tell you to lose some weight: the one motivates you whereas the other pisses you off. Alas, the step where you explain Kanban to everyone and get buy-in seems really difficult and time consuming.

This is the end cap to a series of books I've read lately related to theory of constraints and queueing theory with this book being one that takes those concepts to a point of implementation.I think the power of Kanban is, as David often comments on, the change management aspect. It provides a mechanism for understanding your flow without requiring one single change to the way you currently work. The use of visual controls makes it readily apparent where existing processes need to be improved and also provides the transparency required to help your team and your "customers" make better decisions.I personally cannot wait to find an area to help implement these concepts. Good stuff, simple stuff, powerful stuff, game changing stuff.

There's also a fair amount of practicality, particularly in discussing the speed of the journey to the kaizen culture the author espouses.However, I didn't get a great sense of the author's enthusiasm for the subject and some of the analogies are laboured (the road analogy drew out for far too long). Also there was a fair bit of jam tomorrow which made the book feel less authoritative than it should. But they're not massive issues, if you're looking to improve your development process there's a lot to like in this book.

Good book overall. A little weak on transitioning from existing processes: I feel that when it comes down to nitty gritty details, Anderson is evasive. The Kanban of Kanbans mentioned later in the book seems like compensation of a systemic misapplication of Kanban to too-large systems. The central ideas of rate limiting and providing feedback up the chain of the process's maximum capacity is wonderful, but is not a cure all.

While I felt like the author took every opportunity to take pot shots at other development processes and to point out how smart he was for bringing Kanban to software development, I still loved the book. He does a fantastic job of walking through the process and all the motivations and peculiarities of the process. If you're interested in rolling out a Kanban system, this is the book you need to read.

This is a great book for people new to Kanban, although it does assume a fair amount of knowledge of Agile ideas and practices (don't expect to find a walkthrough of the Agile Manifesto here).There is a nice balance of practical field experience and management theory, and the author generally does a good job of deferring advanced topics to a "later book" rather than getting bogged down in unimportant details at the very beginning -- I can only hope he comes through and writes it!

All definitions, principles and objectives of the Kanban method are in this book.However, to implement Kanban properly you need to use models and you will have to explore this subject yourself (even if the author give you some tips and ideas, you will have to deal with them in depth).By the way, this book is a reference and you should have it not too far away from you, it is always useful.

I can't give it more stars until I implement some of these ideas and see if they work. Not that I doubt they worked for the author, just that I'm in a different domain then software development and while I see some parallels, it's not a perfect fit. He did explain the concepts, benefits, implementation, etc. clearly. His writing style was a bit dry though. But it's not a romance novel so what do you expect?

A good look into how to apply the ideas of lean and flow based production to development teams. I had skimmed this book in the past, but when I actually got into all of the detail I realised how little of the nuance I had really understood. The magic is in the margins!I would recommend reading Reinertsen's book (Principles of Product Development Flow) first for the theory and then using this for more software specific application ideas.
