Al-Noor Ramji Joins Apigee's Advisory Board 


BWW News Desk

October 01, 2013


 LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM(Marketwired - Oct 1, 2013) - Apigee today announced that Al-Noor Ramji, one of the world's leading information technology (IT) experts in the telecommunications and financial industries, has joined the Apigee Advisory Board. Having also played instrumental technology leadership roles at Misys Banking and British Telecom as well as at several major banks, Mr. Ramji will help guide Apigee as it takes its digital business platform into new markets. Apigee helps businesses transform their IT systems in response to the sudden dominance of mobile end-user computing; its customers include many of the world's leading companies, such as the Financial Times, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Pearson and Walgreens.
Apigee announced last month that Aneesh Chopra, the former U.S. Chief Technology Officer, has also joined its Advisory Board.
"Al-Noor Ramji is one of the best-known figures in information technology in Europe, widely recognized as a leading IT visionary," said Chet Kapoor, Apigee CEO. "He has an undisputed track record of successfully leveraging information technology to achieve business objectives, and we're thrilled to have him join our advisory board team." 
Mr. Ramji has just completed a turnaround at Misys, where he was the executive vice president and general manager of Misys Banking. Previously Mr. Ramji served in various executive roles at British Telecom, most recently as chief executive officer for BT Innovate and Design and chief information officer and chief technology officer of BT Group. Prior to British Telecom, he was executive vice president, chief information officer and chief e-commerce officer for Qwest Communications. Mr. Ramji has also served as chief information officer at UBS (then called SBC) and, prior to UBS, as global head of operations at Credit Suisse First Boston. He is a multi-year winner of the CIO 100 Award, CIO Insight IT Leader of the Year 2009, and the British Computer Society CIO of the Year.
Apigee helps organizations transform and succeed in the new data-centric, mobile world. Its digital business platform includes Apigee Enterprise, a complete platform for creating, managing and measuring digital initiatives built on apps, data and APIs; Apigee Insights, a powerful big data analytics platform that helps organizations gain new business insights in the app economy; and the Apigee API Exchange, an API interoperability platform that powers app ecosystems across any industry. 
"Digital transformations are happening today in every industry to create agile, data-powered enterprises that can connect with customers and partners on any kind of mobile device. This agility requires a new style of computing that cannot be delivered by putting old infrastructure in the cloud. Apigee helps businesses effectively leverage the building blocks of this new style of computing: apps, platforms, data and APIs. Helping our customer achieve the triple aims of speed to market with low costs in a highly controlled manner is vital. I look forward to contributing as part of the Apigee Advisory Board," commented Ramji.
Ramji Speaking at the "I love APIs" Conference in San Francisco
Mr. Ramji will join Aneesh Chopra and other technology innovators at the "I love APIs" conference, November 4-6, 2013, in San Francisco. This event will deliver dozens of sessions featuring technology and business experts from Accenture, AT&T, eBay, Kaiser Permanente, Netflix, Outerwall, OnStar, Pearson, Swisscom, Walgreens, and many more.
Register here today for the "I love APIs" conference. For more information, go to the conference website or send an email to [email protected].

The last time I saw him I felt a little rushed...didn't have time to ask questions like I wanted to. But maybe that's because I've made improvements in my health and I don't need his help as much. The first two times I saw him I was very impressed with his patience, kindness, and knowledge. I felt he was actually concerned with me as a person and I felt his empathy. He is also kind of friendly, funny, and down to earth. I liked him as a person. Specialists can be cold but this isn't the case at all with this doctor. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted July 24, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr Ramji was very kind and understanding. One f the best Gastroenterologist in Vancouver.

Knowledgeable, caring and accurate.
Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted January 17, 2016 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeIt's the second time I saw Doctor Ramji for a colonoscopy, I have only positive comments to make about him and about the procedure.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted November 6, 2015 3Staff 5Punctuality 2Helpfulness 3KnowledgeI saw Alnoor early in the morning, no crowd waiting and he was punctual. His assistant was not in, but someone else's assistant helped me and she was professional and courteous. Alnoor was friendly, professional and courteous as well.
I found a solution to my IBS issues during my SIX MONTH WAIT to see him, I used low fodmap diet and, as long as I eat low fodmap, I feel great.
There is still a problem... I can not eat anything but food from my own kitchen because of my high sensitivity. So my problem is not really solved; if I eat the wrong foods, or if I am even the slightest bit cross contaminated (1 grain of wheat, dairy or soy-and possibly after amounts of certain high fodmap foods), I'm extremely sick.
Back to Alnoor Ramji: his thought was "just stick with the low fodmap diet, it works". It reminds me of the old joke: " Doc, it hurts when I do this... Well then don't do that".
If I was some lazy patient that left my life in the hands of the gods, I can half understand that kind of response from him but, as much as I don't trust the gods with my fate, I am religious in my approach to maintaining health and I made that clear to him. Yet, he wasn't interested enough to offer to help me find the source of the problem. I'm not the type to live with something wrong forever, I fix things and that always requires going to the root of the problem. Unfortunately, the medical profession most often goes with just treating the symptoms and/or finding a way to live with the problem. I believe in treating the symptoms during the acute phase, but not as a long-term solution.
Alnoor, if you read this, you seem like a nice guy; I hope at least think about what I've said.
For those looking for a ye or ne, I would have to say customer service was passable, but treatment was a fail. Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted September 2, 2015 3Staff 4Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI have been suffering from un-diagnosed nightly abdominal pain for over 10 years before I was referred to Dr Ramji. He flatly refused to do colonoscopy, and despite me saying Antacid have progressively made me worse, prescribed variety of PPIs, all of them made me much worse,, to the point that my pain was unmanageable. I was lucky I guess that I got so sick while I was in Germany and went under the care of specialists there, who performed capsule endoscopy test, and diagnosed me. It turned out that anti-acids were indeed a poison for my condition. If only this doctor had listened to what I was telling hi instead of sticking to a text-book cookie cutter approach ... Highly NOT recommended.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted August 10, 2015 4Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr Ramji is kind and caring.

Name:Al-Noor Ramji
Company:BT




In the last year, BT has embarked on a worldwide, group-wide transformation programme that has seen the creation of two new operating units: BT Design and BT Operate  (in-life operation).
Al-Noor Ramji, BT Design chief executive said his division is responsible for IT, networks, process and product design across BT, working with all lines of business to deliver products and services for the group’s customers in 170 around the globe.
“In addition, I am responsible as a member of the BT operating committee for 21CN [21st century network] – our open, global, real-time IP [internet protocol] platform and customer experience strategy across the group,” he said. “This broad remit has led MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] to recently name me as an example of a new job title they have coined, chief strategic execution officer.”
Better-than-expected sales at BT for the first three months of 2008 boosted the company outlook, as its chief executive Ben Veerwayen prepared to step down after six years. The group reported an 18 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to £494 million over the first quarter of 2008. But excluding costs incurred from restructuring its business, BT earnings were up two per cent to £1.57 billion. “We have finished the year in style with a strong fourth quarter performance,” said Veerwayen. “BT is in great shape.”
Ramji’s view of his division’s greatest accomplishments support the fact that IT has an integral role to play in the telecommunication services giant’s business. “In the last year, these include building this new, converged organisation,” he said. “To the best of our knowledge, we are the first telco to be without a dedicated networks department. The convergence of four teams is leading to increases in speed of delivery, reduced costs, reduced complexity and increased control and capabilities for our customers. We have also met the tipping point in the realisation our platform strategy. Our matrix architecture now includes 22 strategic platforms over which we are exposing 160 re-usable capabilities via our Web21CN SDK  [software development kit].
“Over the next 12 months we will work to simplify and speed up the way we work, to ensure that we were are delivering right first time, every time for our customers. Specifically, we are capitalising on our success in end-to-end customer experience; testing to build, end-to-end customer experience monitoring; bringing together all the elements (networks, IT, process) to create proactive fault resolution; and more importantly, complete transparency to the customer via a shared portal,” he added.

In support of these initiatives and its end-to-end customer experience monitoring initiative in particular, BT Design will be implementing cloud services and operational and business support systems (OSS/BSS) transformation. “We are actively working to streamline and rationalise our systems and network estate to reflect our matrix architecture. To date we have achieved closure of over 1,300 systems,” said Ramji. BT is also working towards a more partnership-based model with its resource suppliers to ensure that they have shared objectives, with financial incentives and consequences, to meet customer experience metrics.
The organisation anticipates its technology implementations for the next year will deliver new revenues and lower costs. To this end, Ramji noted: “Specifically we are focused on faster development and assembly of new services, lower development operations and bid costs, reuse of investment and development and zero-touch provisioning.”
In industry terms, BT continues to operate in a sector challenged by compliance, security, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and systems consolidation and integration. In response, Ramji concluded: “Our challenges and opportunities remain technology performance and cost, including infrastructure virtualisation, network capacity, software complexity, managing customer demand, providing utility level service and on-demand, high speed comms, equivalence in the UK market and lifting of redundant regulation to facilitate new business models for open innovation, collaboration and development and new revenue models.”

Name:Al-Noor Ramji
Company:BT





BT’s IT function has had an impressive 12 months. It has ‘upskilled’ more than 5,000 IT professionals, so that now 3,100 are engaged in customer-facing, revenue-generating work rather than internal IT projects.
It has also achieved a first-time, net reduction in the systems estate, savings of approximately 19 per cent in unit costs two years in a row, while simultaneously tripling its output, and doubling its delivery speed. The IT team has also increased its internal business partner satisfaction rate to over 80 per cent, as measured by its 90-day Post Implementation Review.


The company is also very proud of its business agility, having implemented and begun to embed agile delivery methodologies.


Global sourcing ratios are such that 80 per cent of development work is offshored, and offshore vendors are not allowed more than 10 per cent of their resource to be onshore at any time.Over the next 12 months BT will be focusing on a number of initiatives. It has just completed a major transformation, moving from narrowband to broadband, connecting customers through an advanced network across 170 countries. 
The company says its software and IT are the essential components of its 21CN global IP platform. “They provide the enabling infrastructure that will help us transform our development and delivery of customer service at a speed and to a quality that have never been possible before,” says Al-Noor Ramji, CIO at BT Group. It is also streamlining and automating its end-to-end processes, and continuing to update its culture for its people. “In addition to product and service innovation, we will concentrate our efforts on creating an unparalleled customer experience, where we deliver ‘right first time’ and as ‘timely’ as is possible.” It will continue to reduce its systems estate from 3,695 systems, into a matrix architecture of 14 platforms and over 150 reusable systems and process capabilities.


“One significant implementation will be the realisation of our matrix architecture of 14 platforms and over 150 reusable capabilities, which will be exposed internally and externally through our user and developer software developer kits. By harnessing innovation beyond the confines of the BT payroll we can create an ecosystem with opportunities for BT to drive revenue throughout the value chain – both in the global network and in new products and services,” says Ramji.


Over the last 18 months the company has identified and started using the primary tools and technologies that will allow it to transform the customer experience. “There are primary tools and technologies we use to improve the customer experience: end-to-end testing; end-to-end monitoring; agile delivery; and closed loop control,” says Ramji. It now tests all the functionality of a new product or solution before releasing it to a customer through end-to-end testing, while it has adopted what it calls “agile delivery”, an iterative approach to development that emphasises the continuous involvement of the customer, a risk-aware mindset (“fail fast, launch small and scale later”) and the reuse of existing products and features wherever possible. The closed-loop control element is a regular (every 90 days) evaluation of the value it is delivering to the customer.


“This ‘fail safe’ mechanism allows us to avoid committing financial and human resources to projects that aren’t meeting specific ROI objectives,” he says.

The arena formerly inhabited by traditional telcos has radically changed, creating different issues for the organisation. Deregulation and technological innovation have enabled new players to enter the market, and its customers demand greater capabilities and control, as well as reduced costs and complexity. But BT believes that early adopters in the consumer, SME, enterprise and CP market are already harnessing benefits from the convergence of communications and computing.


“By harnessing innovation beyond the confines of the BT payroll we can create an ecosystem with opportunities for BT to drive revenue throughout the value chain”
