            The RiverPark mutual funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co., which is not affiliated with RiverPark Advisors, LLC, Wedgewood Partners, Inc., Cohanzick Management, LLC, Talmage, LLC, or their affiliates.

        
Check the background of SEI Investments Distribution Co. on FINRA's BrokerCheck

            Mutual fund investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may
involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With, short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. "The value of the Fund's positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index. Selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for up-front cash at the time of selling the call option. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund's option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund's option strategies may not reduce the Fund's volatility to the extent desired. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives. With the exception of RiverPark/Wedgewood, RiverPark Focused Value, and RiverPark Floating Rate CMBS Fund, each Fund is "diversified", as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, default risk, and interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
		

To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider
                the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing.

The performance quoted herein represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. High short-term performance of the fund is unusual and investors should not expect such performance to be repeated. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. For performance data current to the most recent month end, please call 888.564.4517.
The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund performance data quoted for periods prior to March 30, 2012 is that of the Predecessor Fund. The predecessor Fund inception date is 9/30/209.  The Fund will be managed in a materially equivalent manner to its predecessor. The Predecessor Fund was not a registered mutual fund and was not subject to the same investment and tax restrictions as the Fund. If the annual returns for the predecessor partnership were charged the same fees and expenses as the Fund, the annual returns for the predecessor partnership would have been higher.
The RiverPark Long/short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. Due to the inherent leveraged nature of options, a relatively small adverse move in the price of the underlying instrument may result in immediate and substantial losses to the Fund. The use of options, swaps and derivatives by the Fund has the potential to significantly increase the Fund's volatility. The Fund is non-diversified. Mutual fund investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
To determine if this Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and other information may be found in the Fund’s prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 888.564.4517, or by visiting the website at www.riverparkfunds.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
The RiverPark funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co., which is not affiliated with the Adviser or its affiliates.

Risk Measurement Statistics: Max Drawdown is a metric used to evaluate risk. It measures the single largest peak to trough decline in an investment's or index’s net asset value over a period of negative performance since inception of the investment. Different indices and investments will experience drawdowns over different time periods. However, comparing max drawdowns over a common time period among multiple investments or indices provides a common basis for comparing two or more sets of data. The max drawdown for a particular index may be different than the max drawdown presented if it were to include the entire period of such index’s existence rather than the period set forth above. Since the Fund was converted from a partnership with only historical monthly performance, the max drawdown is calculated based on monthly performance information. Down Market Performance is a metric used to evaluate risk. It measures the average monthly performance of the Fund as compared to the average monthly performance of the Fund’s benchmark, the S&P 500, for the months in which the benchmark lost money. Gross exposure is calculated by adding the percentage of the Fund's equity invested in short sales to the percentage of its equity used for long positions. Net exposure takes into account the benefits of offsetting long and short positions and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of the Fund's equity capital invested in short sales from the percentage of its equity capital used for long positions. The Sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate - such as that of the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill - from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. The above material is for educational purposes only and is not meant to be investment advice. The reader should consult with his/her financial advisor for more information. This material represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific point in time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events, or a guarantee of future results.  Alpha and Beta are calculated based on a regression of monthly performance data since inception versus the S&P 500 total return index.

Mutual fund investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. High Yield bonds involved greater risk of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
Definitions:
            Yield to Worst:The lowest potential yield that can be received on a bond without the issuer actually defaulting. The yield to worst is calculated by making worst-case scenario assumptions on the issue by calculating the returns that would be received if provisions, including prepayment, call or sinking fund, are used by the issuer.
Average Maturity:This figure is computed by weighting the maturity of each security in the portfolio by the market value of the security, then averaging these weighted figures. 
BofA Merrill US High Yield Index: Tracks the performance of U.S. dollar denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long term.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
This material does not constitute investment advice or an investment recommendation regarding any security or investment strategy. All investment vehicles and investment strategies involve risk and there is no guarantee that the investment objectives discussed will be met or that the strategies discussed will be successful. This material is not intended to be used on a standalone basis but rather is intended to be used in conjunction with mutual fund literature in order to provide investors a better understanding of the investment methodologies employed.
Investing in options involves considerable risk including, but not limited to, market risk, leverage risk, correlation risk and execution risk. Market risk: the general risk inherent in the market, including the potential for pronounced and unexpected price movements and increased volatility. Leverage risk: options contracts involve inherent leverage. The use of leverage can amplify the effects of market volatility and may result in increased probability of investment loss. Correlation risk: the risk that changes in the value of the option contract may not correlate as expected with the underlying asset and that this condition may persist for an extended period of time. Further, the historic observed relationships on which this strategy is based may not persist into the future or may reverse, potentially resulting in partial or total loss. For example, the relationship between Implied and Realized Volatility may change in the future, rendering the strategy less effective than desired. Execution risk: the risk that the investor may not be able to execute the strategy as intended or in a timely manner which may result in loss. For example, the investor may be unable to offset a short position at the desired price or within the desired time frame resulting in an outsized loss. For a more comprehensive treatment of options risks and mechanics, see "The Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options" (the Options Disclosure Document) at http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). Selling options may subject the investor to potentially unlimited losses and an investor may lose some or all of his investment within a very short time. Options are not suitable for all investors.

Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. For most recent quarter-end and month-end performance, please click here. The performance data quoted for periods prior to April 30, 2012 is that of the Predecessor Fund. The RiverPark/Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund will be managed in a materially equivalent manner to its predecessor. The Predecessor Fund was not a registered mutual fund and was not subject to the same investment and tax restrictions as the Fund. If the annual returns for the predecessor partnership were charged the same fees and expenses as the Fund, the annual returns for the predecessor partnership would have been higher.
Data included in the presentation represented by 'Long/Short Equity' refers to the Morningstar Long/Short category.
Mutual fund investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. Due to the inherent leveraged nature of options, a relatively small adverse move in the price of the underlying instrument may result in immediate and substantial losses to the Fund. The value of the Fund’s positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index. Selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for up-front cash at the time of selling the call option. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s option strategies may not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives.

            Mutual fund investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may
involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With, short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. "The value of the Fund's positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index.

With the exception of RiverPark/Wedgewood, RiverPark Focused Value, and RiverPark Floating Rate CMBS Fund, each Fund is "diversified", as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, default risk, and interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions.

            Mutual fund investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may
involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With, short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. "The value of the Fund's positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index. Selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for up-front cash at the time of selling the call option. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund's option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund's option strategies may not reduce the Fund's volatility to the extent desired. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives. With the exception of RiverPark/Wedgewood, RiverPark Focused Value, and RiverPark Floating Rate CMBS Fund, each Fund is "diversified", as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, default risk, and interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
		

To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider
                the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing.
                This and other information may be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be obtained

                Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

The performance quoted herein represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. High short-term performance of the fund is unusual and investors should not expect such performance to be repeated. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. For performance data current to the most recent month end, please call 888.564.4517.
The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund performance data quoted for periods prior to March 30, 2012 is that of the Predecessor Fund. The predecessor Fund inception date is 9/30/209.  The Fund will be managed in a materially equivalent manner to its predecessor. The Predecessor Fund was not a registered mutual fund and was not subject to the same investment and tax restrictions as the Fund. If the annual returns for the predecessor partnership were charged the same fees and expenses as the Fund, the annual returns for the predecessor partnership would have been higher.
The RiverPark Long/short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. Due to the inherent leveraged nature of options, a relatively small adverse move in the price of the underlying instrument may result in immediate and substantial losses to the Fund. The use of options, swaps and derivatives by the Fund has the potential to significantly increase the Fund's volatility. The Fund is non-diversified. Mutual fund investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
To determine if this Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and other information may be found in the Fund’s prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 888.564.4517, or by visiting the website at www.riverparkfunds.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
The RiverPark funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co., which is not affiliated with the Adviser or its affiliates.

Risk Measurement Statistics: Max Drawdown is a metric used to evaluate risk. It measures the single largest peak to trough decline in an investment's or index’s net asset value over a period of negative performance since inception of the investment. Different indices and investments will experience drawdowns over different time periods. However, comparing max drawdowns over a common time period among multiple investments or indices provides a common basis for comparing two or more sets of data. The max drawdown for a particular index may be different than the max drawdown presented if it were to include the entire period of such index’s existence rather than the period set forth above. Since the Fund was converted from a partnership with only historical monthly performance, the max drawdown is calculated based on monthly performance information. Down Market Performance is a metric used to evaluate risk. It measures the average monthly performance of the Fund as compared to the average monthly performance of the Fund’s benchmark, the S&P 500, for the months in which the benchmark lost money. Gross exposure is calculated by adding the percentage of the Fund's equity invested in short sales to the percentage of its equity used for long positions. Net exposure takes into account the benefits of offsetting long and short positions and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of the Fund's equity capital invested in short sales from the percentage of its equity capital used for long positions. The Sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate - such as that of the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill - from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. The above material is for educational purposes only and is not meant to be investment advice. The reader should consult with his/her financial advisor for more information. This material represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific point in time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events, or a guarantee of future results.  Alpha and Beta are calculated based on a regression of monthly performance data since inception versus the S&P 500 total return index.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
This material does not constitute investment advice or an investment recommendation regarding any security or investment strategy. All investment vehicles and investment strategies involve risk and there is no guarantee that the investment objectives discussed will be met or that the strategies discussed will be successful. This material is not intended to be used on a standalone basis but rather is intended to be used in conjunction with mutual fund literature in order to provide investors a better understanding of the investment methodologies employed.
Investing in options involves considerable risk including, but not limited to, market risk, leverage risk, correlation risk and execution risk. Market risk: the general risk inherent in the market, including the potential for pronounced and unexpected price movements and increased volatility. Leverage risk: options contracts involve inherent leverage. The use of leverage can amplify the effects of market volatility and may result in increased probability of investment loss. Correlation risk: the risk that changes in the value of the option contract may not correlate as expected with the underlying asset and that this condition may persist for an extended period of time. Further, the historic observed relationships on which this strategy is based may not persist into the future or may reverse, potentially resulting in partial or total loss. For example, the relationship between Implied and Realized Volatility may change in the future, rendering the strategy less effective than desired. Execution risk: the risk that the investor may not be able to execute the strategy as intended or in a timely manner which may result in loss. For example, the investor may be unable to offset a short position at the desired price or within the desired time frame resulting in an outsized loss. For a more comprehensive treatment of options risks and mechanics, see "The Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options" (the Options Disclosure Document) at http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). Selling options may subject the investor to potentially unlimited losses and an investor may lose some or all of his investment within a very short time. Options are not suitable for all investors.

Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. For most recent quarter-end and month-end performance, please click here. The performance data quoted for periods prior to April 30, 2012 is that of the Predecessor Fund. The RiverPark/Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund will be managed in a materially equivalent manner to its predecessor. The Predecessor Fund was not a registered mutual fund and was not subject to the same investment and tax restrictions as the Fund. If the annual returns for the predecessor partnership were charged the same fees and expenses as the Fund, the annual returns for the predecessor partnership would have been higher.
Data included in the presentation represented by 'Long/Short Equity' refers to the Morningstar Long/Short category.
Mutual fund investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. Due to the inherent leveraged nature of options, a relatively small adverse move in the price of the underlying instrument may result in immediate and substantial losses to the Fund. The value of the Fund’s positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index. Selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for up-front cash at the time of selling the call option. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s option strategies may not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives.

involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With, short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund.

            Mutual fund investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may
involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. The RiverPark Long/Short Opportunity Fund uses leverage. If the securities decrease in value, the Fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage. With, short sales, losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the Fund. "The value of the Fund's positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index. Selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for up-front cash at the time of selling the call option. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund's option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund's option strategies may not reduce the Fund's volatility to the extent desired. Accordingly, the purchase of Fund shares should be viewed as a long-term investment. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its stated objectives. With the exception of RiverPark/Wedgewood, RiverPark Focused Value, and RiverPark Floating Rate CMBS Fund, each Fund is "diversified", as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, default risk, and interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives.
		

To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider
                the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing.
                This and other information may be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be obtained

                Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
