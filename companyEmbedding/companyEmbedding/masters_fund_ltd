Asian Masters Fund





















































 





















  










 


INVEST IN THE ASIAN GROWTH STORY
A diversified portfolio of Asian equities, focused on the emerging Asian middle class

infinite 


2017-03-10T05:45:14+00:00 



The Asian Masters Fund Limited (the Fund) was established in November 2007 as a multi-manager listed investment company to provide Australian investors the opportunity to gain exposure to leading Asian equities funds. The Fund invests in specialist funds which invest primarily in listed stocks in Asia or securities of companies that derive the majority of their business from Asia. The Fund is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange under the ticker “AUF”.
The Fund aims to generate high real returns over time, primarily through capital growth, and within acceptable risk parameters.
Unlike a traditional investment vehicle, a multi-manager style investment company invests not in securities traded on an exchange, but in managed investment schemes and other funds that in turn make the investment in underlying securities. The Asian Masters Fund does not have any direct holdings in Asian listed equities.
Through the Fund, Australian domiciled retail investors can gain access to a diversified portfolio of funds managed by leading Asian equities fund managers.
Key advantages of investing in Asian Masters Fund Limited include:


Access to leading Asian equity managers that may not have products available for Australian based retail investors to invest in;


Potential for lower entry costs, as Walsh & Company Asset Management Pty Limited, the manager of the Fund, may be able to negotiate fee discounts and rebates (including for any upfront entry costs);

Investors will be investing in an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and accordingly, may only be exposed directly to the tax consequences of investing in an Australian company; and

Access to a diversified portfolio that is actively managed by a dedicated Investment Manager whose principals have extensive contacts and experience in assessing Asian markets and Asian equities fund managers.

Risks
Like all investments, an investment in the Fund carries risks which may result in the loss of income or principal invested. In addition to the general risks of investing, specific risks associated with investing in the Fund include, but not limited to, Asian equity risk, sovereign risk and currency risk. For further information about the risks of investing in the product see Section 3 in the Prospectus.

 Titan Masters International Fund, Ltd.
 Titan Advisors, LLC


Company Overview 


Titan Advisors, LLC is an experienced asset management firm focused exclusively on hedge funds.  The business is 14 years old and 100% employee-owned, with a 46 person staff and over $5.0 billion USD in assets under management.  Titan maintains offices in Stamford, CT., Toronto and London. 

Titan’s products consist of diversified portfolios of nimble, opportunistic hedge fund managers who share the goal of generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns independent of the major indices over time.

The founders of Titan Advisors have remained true to their core tenets for more than 20 years, allocating to the most liquid and least leveraged strategies, with a strong emphasis on emerging hedge fund talent.  

Business Lines:

-Commingled Products
-Insurance Dedicated Funds 
-Custom Strategies
-Seed Fund Vehicles

Titan’s predecessor firm, G. Fox & Co., Inc. was founded in 1992 by George Fox.  Initially, G. Fox & Co. was a hedge fund-only advisory business serving clients in the southern part of the U.S.  The advisory business grew from 1992 to 2000 to serve regional consulting firms, endowments, foundations, and a number of high net worth families in the Northeast.  At the end of 2000, G. Fox & Co. advised on approximately $800 million in hedge fund assets.  In late 2000 and early 2001, the firm began to add more investment professionals and was renamed Titan Advisors, LLC.  During this time, Titan shifted its focus to hedge fund of funds, ultimately bringing the advisory business to a close.  

In 2001, Titan launched the diversified, multi-strategy Masters Funds.  This was followed up in 2002 with the multi-strategy Legacy Funds structured for insurance companies.  In 2005, the Titan Emerging Managers Fund was launched, targeting younger and smaller fund managers in order to make early allocations and secure better access and capacity for future use at Titan.  In June 2006, Titan launched the Global Equity Fund, a product designed to focus exclusively on global long/short equity investing.  Prior to adding funds and assets, Titan has steadily enhanced its investment and back office teams to support the growth. 

Titan Advisors, LLC is 100% employee-owned by the following individuals, being the “Principals” of the firm: George Fox, Tom Holliday, Doug Herman, Darren Ross and Rick Leifels.


Fund Strategy 


The fund's objective is to provide consistent, superior capital appreciation through the use of a multi-manager investment strategy. The fund's portfolio construction process seeks returns of 8-15%, with a standard deviation of 6% or less and 75% profitable months. The portfolio consists of approximately 20 - 24 managers utilizing long/short equity, global macro/CTA and event driven strategies. The fund seeks to avoid managers that rely significantly on illiquid strategies or substantial leverage.
