Performance Ratings are derived by comparing this fund's load-adjusted returns with the returns from all other funds with the same High Yield Bond investment style. To dig deeper, try the Mutual Funds Research Topic to view a pre-sorted list of mutual funds and ETFs with the best 1-year, 5-year and 10-year ratings.Key Details


Fund Objective:  The investment seeks high current income by investing primarily in a high-yield bond mutual fund and in a portfolio of fixed-income securities.

Methodology:  The fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in the High Yield Bond Portfolio (the "underlying fund"), a portfolio of Federated Core Trust. The underlying fund in turn invests in a diversified portfolio of domestic corporate high-yield bonds (also known as "junk bonds"), but may invest a portion of its portfolio in securities of issuers based outside the United States. The fund is non-diversified.

Trailing returns represent the annualized total return, which includes all income and capital-gains distributions. Load-adjusted returns are adjusted downward to account for front-end and back-end load fees. The trailing and load-adjusted returns will match if the fund does not charge any load fees. With an inception date of 12/24/2008, this fund does not have enough data to compute returns beyond the 5-year mark. Investor Returns as calculated by Morningstar measure how the average investor performed over time by tracking all cash flows into and out of the fund.
