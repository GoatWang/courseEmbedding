Stryker Poised on Solid Product Portfolio and Acquisitions

 On Jul 17, we issued an updated research report on Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation SYK  , one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has a diversified product portfolio which cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. Stryker's pipeline includes products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 18 global robot installations, of which 11 were in the U.S. Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company's market position. Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost its growth profile. In June, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. for $11.75 per share, or $701 million with a net purchase price of $654 million. The transaction is structured as an arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by NOVADAQ's shareholders. Additionally, the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control added $245 million to the company's net sales in the last quarter. Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company's Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in the first quarter of 2017. On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market. Stryker's strong guidance is also a catalyst. For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.48-$1.52 per share. For the full year, the company estimates adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35-$6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017. Over the last six months, the stock represented a strong return of 18.6%, higher than the Zacks classified Medical - Products  sub-industry's gain of 17.3%. The current level is also significantly higher than the S&P 500's return of 8.9% over the same time frame.     Other Key Picks  A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW  , CryoLife, Inc. CRY  and EDAP TMS SA EDAP  . Notably, EDAP TMS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences and CryoLife have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .  EDAP TMS represents an impressive return of 37.05% for the last three months. The company delivered a solid earnings surprise of 533.3% in the last reported quarter. Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. Notably, the stock represents an impressive one-year return of 9.6%. CryoLife yielded a strong return of 9.6% over the last one month. The stock delivered a positive earnings surprise of 80% in the last reported quarter.  5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course. Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

            Best market watch app l've found so far. Most complete display on a tile for individual stocks. The only thing I wish they had is more tiles allowed  to be pinned (they limit them to 3!).
Update: What happened to charts??? They are no longer available.

            I use this app as my main tool for following my stocks. For a quick view it's better than Yahoo and my broker's website. The best features for me are portfolio and position views. Each portfolio value is displayed plus the value of all portfolios. The positions screen shows the total value of each security across all of the portfolios. Another great feature is the information, charts and news available for each stock. The one new feature I'm waiting for is to get this app on my Surface and PC!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

How to Build a Stock Portfolio
Once you have chosen your investment strategy it is time to start learning how to build a stock portfolio. Your strategies should be inline with your overall investment strategy such as whether you are day trading and the level of risk you are looking for. Although we are sticking to stocks in this article, a lot of the principles can be applied to other assets as well.
There are thousands of different way’s to choose stocks and the chosen strategy can vary widely depending on the type of strategy you wish to employ and your objectives. Since there are so many we will look at some of the more popular strategies.
Note: For most investors choosing individual stocks is not always the wisest decision and should focus more on asset allocation and diversification. On a virtual trading site, however, we have the luxury of being able trade with large of sums of money and can make trades without worrying about the losses.
Screeners
No matter what strategy you use, a stock screener is an absolute must to find what stocks you are looking for. With a screener you can easily select penny stocks, or ETF’s or find out which company has had a large increase in the few weeks.
Strategies
Random Picks
Picking a portfolio of 100 stocks randomly has been proven, on average, to beat the market. So if you don’t know where to start, you can just pick random stocks and still hope to get a decent return.
High Risk
A virtual exchange is a perfect location to practice high risk trading. To obtain a high risk portfolio, one would select penny stocks, triple leveraged ETF’s like oil 3X UWTI. Penny stocks are generally just that, stocks that cost a few pennies. High risk may be scary but it also has the potential for huge rewards.
Buy What You Know
The best way to start of with picking stocks is to pick a stock of a company you already know about. If they have reached you as a customer, chances are they have done something right. If you see a company that not many know about that is becoming more and more popular with your friends you can get the stock before anyone even knows about it and hope to get huge returns. Another reason this works is because brand image is a very important and if you know the brand, then the company has already succeeded in something that has a lot of value.
Word of Mouth
On the other hand, one should generally not buy a company because a friend has recommended the stock because he made lots of money. In general, this strategy works very poorly since by the time you have bought you have already lost the potential for making money. This means the news you received from your friend that the company is a buy is usually quite old and stale. The other reasons is that even if you know someone who works in finance and is at the very forefront of news for a certain company, you still have to trust that he has given you a good buy.
Fundamental Analysis
This process involves researching a companies “Fundamentals” to try and ascertain what the value of the stock should be. Fundamentals include their earnings reports, forecasts, competitiveness in it’s industry and many more. Finance students will often learn about the fundamental analysis in university and is how most analysts come up with a stock rating. Essentially, if the stock’s value is under the current price, it would be a buy and if the stock’s value is below it would be a sell. If the value was roughly the same as the current price, it would be a neutral position (or hold) meaning you shouldn’t sell if you already have it but it is not a buy either. Analysts generally have one field of expertise in an industry they know more in, as the industry they are in is important. 
Price Earnings
One way to quickly look at stocks that could be worth purchasing is through P/E ratio or Price to Earnings. This gives an indication of how expensive a stock is with regards to it’s earning potential. A stock with a lower P/E ratio is generally more desirable than a stock with a high P/E ratio.
Technical Analysis
Using charts, patterns and a variety of other tools, technical traders try to predict what the market will do or determine the strength of a trend.
Trend following
A very old adage in the stock market is that “The Trend is Your Friend”. When in a bull market buy you can buy the SPY ETF to ride the trend until you hit a bear market and then short SPY while in a bear market. Technical analysis can be useful here as well to get a better idea of whether the market is trending upwards or downwards.
Day trading
Day traders typically use technical analysis to determine strength of a trend or predict a trend to make a profit over a few minutes to at most a day.  In order to successfully day trade you will need to find stocks with higher volatility, have sufficient volume and have a low enough price to be able to invest larger quantities of money and thus be able to buy more shares. 
Dividend
A lot of investors like to have reliable companies with strong dividend history. By looking for high dividend yield’s and a good history of dividends, one can get a good reliable stock that will provide income every quarter or month.
Market Cap
“Too big to Fail” is the motto of this investment strategy. With this, someone would pick companies with very high market capitalization, that is to say, a very large company. This is essentially saying that the company has done well so far, why shouldn’t it in the future. These stocks tend to be “blue-chip” stocks as well.
Contrarian
This strategy essentially does the opposite of the market sentiment. When most people are buying, you are selling and when most are selling, you are buying.
Warren Buffet
One of the greatest investors of all time uses a variety of the strategies we’ve seen above but can be summed up pretty easily. Warren Buffet essentially buys great companies at a good price. Some of the ways he chooses an investment are as follows:

Competitive Advantage – A company has to have a great competitive advantage over the competition. This could be anything from a patent to economies of scale.
Brand – A good brand provides a huge competitive advantage, especially for simple every day things like ketchup and toothpaste.
Reasonable Price – A great company isn’t a great company if it is very expensive right now. Warren buffet has said that what a company costs is the price, but what you get is the value.
Proven – A company has to have a long and stable track record of earnings before he will invest in them.

Warren Buffet’s approach is therefore close to someone using fundamental analysis but throwing out anything that isn’t a good company with a great brand.
