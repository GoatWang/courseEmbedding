This Amendment No. 35 to Schedule 13D amends the Schedule 13D initially filed on July 14, 1997 (collectively, with amendments thereto, the "Schedule 13D").
 
Item 1.     Security and Issuer
 
The title of class of equity securities to which this statement relates is Units of Limited Partnership Interest of SB Partners, the (“Issuer”), a New York limited partnership having its principal offices at 1 New Haven Avenue, Suite 102A, Milford, CT. 06460.
 
Item 2.     Identity and Background
 
This report is being filed by SRE Clearing Services Corporation, (the “Corporation”), a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware for the purpose of owning and holding investments in equity securities, having its principal office at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, 35th floor, New York, NY 10020. The Corporation is an affiliate of the general partner of the Issuer. There are no and for the last five years have been no criminal or civil proceedings involving the corporation.
 
Attached as Appendix A is information concerning the directors and executive officers of the Corporation.
 
Item 3.     Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration
 
Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
The funds used for the purchase of the Units of Limited Partnership Interest are from unencumbered working capital of the Corporation. No part of the funds represents borrowings from a bank. Approximately $4,202,924 has been expended.
 
Item 4.     Purpose of Transaction.
 
The units of limited partnership interest are being acquired for investment purposes, without any intention of changing or influencing control of the Issuer. Although the forgoing is an accurate reflection of the present plans and intentions of the Corporation, the forgoing is subject to change at any time. In the event of a material change in its present plans or intentions, the Corporation will amend this schedule 13D to reflect such change.
 
Item 5.     Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
As of June 1, 2017, the Corporation owns 3,334.5 units of limited partnership interest, a total of forty-three and zero tenth percent (43.0%) of the total units outstanding of 7,752.5 units. No units are held personally by any of the directors or officers of the Corporation. To the extent limited partners have any voting powers, those powers are at the sole discretion of the Corporation, as is the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the units beneficially owned.
 
During the last sixty days, the Corporation has purchased a total of twenty-one and one-half (21.5) units from former unitholders.
 
No other person has rights to receive or direct dividends or distributions relating to, or the proceeds from the sale of, the units owned by the Corporation.
 
Item 6.     Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings, or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
 

 
 

 
 
Page 4 of 4 Pages

Item 7.     Material to be Filed as Exhibits.
 
None of the required exhibits is applicable to this filing, as none of the pertinent disclosures are applicable. Please refer also to Items 3, 4, and 6.
 
Signature
 
After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, I certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete, and correct.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Campbell, CA professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Campbell, CA portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Campbell, CA professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Campbell

What is a design-build firm?Design-build firms take on the responsibilities of architects, contractors and construction companies, all under one roof. These full-service firms focus on a streamlined design-build process — from the initial design to the estimating phase to physical construction — in the hope of creating an efficient experience for both the client and the company. Because the entire project is happening within one company, Campbell design-build firms are able to overlap the design and construction phases of the project, which often speeds up the project significantly. In addition, these firms work to minimize risks for the project owner through single-point responsibility contracts. However, depending on the firm, you may still want to contact an interior designer or architect to help create the exact look you want. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of design-build firms: Interior Designers & Decorators, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Architects & Building Designers, Photographers.Before deciding on a residential design-and-build company in Campbell, CA, think about what you want from your new home. Do you want a large kitchen for entertaining? Do you need several bedrooms for children and guests? Do you want a finished basement for extra space or storage? Look for Campbell design-builders that specialize in the areas you're looking for. Budget is obviously a determining factor in the outcome of your project. To make sure you stay within your means, consider making a must-have list and a wish list. Gauge where the estimates are falling to determine which design-build contract can realistically strike the balance between the two.Questions to ask a prospective Campbell design-builder: How long have you been in the design-build construction business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? Are the workers employees or subcontractors? Can you provide me with references? Who is your designer, and what are his or her qualifications? Are your employees licensed and insured? How do you charge, and what does that include? Can you give me a written estimate? What do your services include? When can this job get done? What happens when cost exceeds the budget? What about changes to materials or labor pricing? What will I need to provide? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a Campbell design-build company on Houzz.
