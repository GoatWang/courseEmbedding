Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

eXp World Holdings






Glenn Sanford
Founder, CEO,
eXp World Holdings
Read Bio×Glenn Sanford, Founder, CEO
Since early 2002, Glenn Sanford has been actively involved in the online real estate space. In early 2007, Mr. Sanford launched BuyerTours Realty, LLC which, using a combination of web and traditional bricks and mortar, grew to three offices and into two states. After the drop off of the market in late 2008, Mr. Sanford and his executive team went back and rewrote the entire business model in recognition of the “perfect storm” of lower revenues, fixed or rising overhead costs, and a consumer with more information and access than ever before. eXp Realty, LLC was launched in October 2009 as the first truly cloud-based national real estate brokerage which meant giving up the traditional bricks and mortar environment and moving to a fully-immersive 3D virtual office environment where agents, brokers and staff collaborate across borders while learning and transacting business from anywhere in the world. In 2013, eXp Realty became a subsidiary of eXp Realty International Corp.
From 2004 to 2007, Mr. Sanford ran a large mega-agent team and consulted to Keller Williams International as a member of the Agent Technology Council in the areas of online client acquisition, client conversion and technology. Mr. Sanford was also a significant contributor to Keller Williams Internet Lead Generation Masterminds.
Prior to real estate, Mr. Sanford was active at the executive level with a number of technology-related companies. In 1998, Mr. Sanford founded and served as President for eShippers.com, an online e-commerce and logistics company.

Trow Global Holdings Inc., a Brampton, Ontario-based engineering, consulting, and project management firm, has changed its name to exp Global Inc. Members of the Trow Global family of companies will adopt the new exp brand to better represent the breadth of services, geographic reach, and scope of the organization.
“Today marks the beginning of a new era for our organization and our clients,” said Vlad Stritesky, president and CEO of exp Global. “Changing our brand to exp is the culmination of more than 25 companies and thousands of people coming together. This change will help us drive home the message that we provide a complete range of services, where our clients need them, and all under one roof.”
More than 30 companies throughout North America will adopt the exp brand, including United States-based companies X-nth and Trow Engineering Consultants. Teng & Assocs. Inc., an exp company based in Chicago and with offices across the U.S., will adopt the exp name in the coming months.
