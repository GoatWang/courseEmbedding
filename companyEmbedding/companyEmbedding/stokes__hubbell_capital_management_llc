Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Our History & Approach

Our History
In 1987, David Stokes and Steven Hubbell joined as partners to form their own independent financial planning firm, Stokes & Hubbell Capital Management, LLC. Over the years, their practice has expanded to include a wide range of clients across the country, now with assets under management or advisement in excess of $900 million. Todd Hubbell, Carson Strickland, Greg Stokes and Doug Stokes have joined the firm, bringing with them the perspectives of the next generation and helping to ensure that clients will have trusted, highly qualified advisors for years to come. The core value of our firm has always been, and will continue to be, “put the client’s interest first.”
Our Growth
Our business has been fortunate to serve more clients each year solely through the introductions we receive from our current clients. We do not rely on advertising; instead, our commitment to serve each client has been the underlying source of our success.

About Us

We provide sophisticated investment solutions for individuals and institutions based on the specific needs, goals, and circumstances of each client. We approach each client from an individual perspective in order to properly position, protect, and transfer wealth.

Asset Allocation



Asset Allocation
The mix of different investments and styles in your portfolio is a crucial component of any investment strategy. In order to build an appropriate portfolio, we continually work with you to discuss a long-term asset allocation for each particular account. Stokes & Hubbell maintains a diversified portfolio of low-cost assets with the goal of enhancing return within your level of risk tolerance.




Tax Efficiency



Tax Efficiency
Different accounts have different tax treatments. In after-tax accounts, we believe tax efficiency is a critical component of financial planning and portfolio performance over time. We strive to invest in tax efficient assets and maintain low portfolio turnover to reduce annual tax liability. We may continually look for opportunities in tax-loss harvesting with the goal of improving your portfolio’s after-tax return. Also, we work with CPAs and Tax Attorneys to place your investments into vehicles for estate planning and wealth transfer purposes that seek to ensure the majority of your wealth is passed on to your designated beneficiaries – not the IRS.




Open Architecture



Open Architecture
We believe investment success centers around a comprehensive approach to allocating assets between low-cost index positions, dividend growth equities, high-grade fixed income, and professionally managed funds with proven track records. The strategies and solutions are specifically selected to address the objectives of each client and assets are allocated tactically based upon current market conditions and individual client goals.
