Introduction 

John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937), founder of the Standard Oil Company, became one of the world’s wealthiest men and a major philanthropist. Born into modest circumstances in upstate New York, he entered the then-fledgling oil business in 1863 by investing in a Cleveland, Ohio, refinery. In 1870, he established Standard Oil, which by the early 1880s controlled some 90 percent of U.S. refineries and pipelines. Critics accused Rockefeller of engaging in unethical practices, such as predatory pricing and colluding with railroads to eliminate his competitors, in order to gain a monopoly in the industry. In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court found Standard Oil in violation of anti-trust laws and ordered it to dissolve. During his life Rockefeller donated more than $500 million to various philanthropic causes.

 John D. Rockefeller: Early Years and Family       
John Davison Rockefeller, the son of a traveling salesman, was born on July 8, 1839, in Richford, New York. Industrious even as a boy, the future oil magnate earned money by raising turkeys, selling candy and doing jobs for neighbors. In 1853, the Rockefeller family moved to the Cleveland, Ohio, area, where John attended high school then briefly studied bookkeeping at a commercial college.
Did You Know? One of the charitable organizations established by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. was the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, founded in 1909. Less than 20 years after its creation, the Commission had achieved its primary goals, the successful eradication of hookworm disease across the southern United States.In 1855, at age 16, he found work as an office clerk at a Cleveland commission firm that bought, sold and shipped grain, coal and other commodities. (He considered September 26, the day he started the position and entered the business world, so significant that as an adult he commemorated this “job day” with an annual celebration.) In 1859, Rockefeller and a partner established their own commission firm. That same year, America’s first oil well was drilled in Titusville, Pennsylvania. In 1863, Rockefeller and several partners entered the booming new oil industry by investing in a Cleveland refinery.
In 1864, Rockefeller married Laura Celestia “Cettie” Spelman (1839-1915), an Ohio native whose father was a prosperous merchant, politician and abolitionist active in the Underground Railroad. (Laura Rockefeller became the namesake of Spelman College, the historically black women’s college in Atlanta, Georgia, that her husband helped finance.) The Rockefellers went on to have four daughters (three of whom survived to adulthood) and one son.
 John D. Rockefeller: Standard Oil       
In 1865, Rockefeller borrowed money to buy out some of his partners and take control of the refinery, which had become the largest in Cleveland. Over the next few years, he acquired new partners and expanded his business interests in the growing oil industry. At the time, kerosene, derived from petroleum and used in lamps, was becoming an economic staple. In 1870, Rockefeller formed the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, along with his younger brother William (1841-1922), Henry Flagler (1830-1913) and a group of other men. John Rockefeller was its president and largest shareholder.
Standard Oil gained a monopoly in the oil industry by buying rival refineries and developing companies for distributing and marketing its products around the globe. In 1882, these various companies were combined into the Standard Oil Trust, which would control some 90 percent of the nation’s refineries and pipelines. In order to exploit economies of scale, Standard Oil did everything from build its own oil barrels to employ scientists to figure out new uses for petroleum by-products.
Rockefeller’s enormous wealth and success made him a target of muckraking journalists, reform politicians and others who viewed him as a symbol of corporate greed and criticized the methods with which he’d built his empire. As The New York Times reported in 1937: “He was accused of crushing out competition, getting rich on rebates from railroads, bribing men to spy on competing companies, of making secret agreements, of coercing rivals to join the Standard Oil Company under threat of being forced out of business, building up enormous fortunes on the ruins of other men, and so on.”
In 1890, the U.S. Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, the first federal legislation prohibiting trusts and combinations that restrained trade. Two years later, the Ohio Supreme Court dissolved the Standard Oil Trust; however, the businesses within the trust soon became part of Standard Oil of New Jersey, which functioned as a holding company. In 1911, after years of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Standard Oil of New Jersey was in violation of anti-trust laws and forced it to dismantle (it was broken up into more than 30 individual companies).
 John D. Rockefeller: Philanthropy and Final Years       
Rockefeller retired from day-to-day business operations of Standard Oil in the mid-1890s. Inspired in part by fellow Gilded Age tycoon Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), who made a vast fortune in the steel industry then became a philanthropist and gave away the bulk of his money, Rockefeller donated more than half a billion dollars to various educational, religious and scientific causes. Among his activities, he funded the establishment of the University of Chicago and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University).
In his personal life, Rockefeller was devoutly religious, a temperance advocate and an avid golfer. His goal was to reach the age of 100; however, he died at 97 on May 23, 1937, at The Casements, his winter home in Ormond Beach, Florida. (Rockefeller owned multiple residences, including a home in New York City, an estate in Lakewood, New Jersey, and an estate called Kykuit, old Dutch for “lookout,” set on 3,000 acres near Tarrytown, New York.) He was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

ATLANTA, June 28, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) President John E. Maupin Jr., D.D.S. announced his planned retirement, closing a celebrated tenure and an over 30-year accomplished career in academic medicine, healthcare administration and public health.  Effective July 1, 2014, after the end of the upcoming academic year, Dr. Maupin will be succeeded by Valerie Montgomery Rice, M.D., a Harvard-educated obstetrician and gynecologist, who was named as executive vice president and dean in 2011. Dr. Montgomery Rice will retain the position of dean when she becomes president next year. With this announcement, Dr. Montgomery Rice becomes the nation's first African-American woman to lead a free-standing medical school as chief executive officer. As dean, she will continue amongst the ranks of the 16 percent of women serving as dean leading academic medical institutions.

In 2010, the MSM board of trustees approved a new leadership structure that would merge the roles of dean and president upon Dr. Maupin's retirement. This new structure is consistent with a recent trend among the nation's medical schools-- elevating the role of dean to chief executive officer while retaining chief academic officer responsibilities. 
"We are appreciative for the service and superior leadership Dr. Maupin displayed during his seven-year tenure as president," said Anthony Welters, chairman of MSM's board of trustees, executive vice president of United Health Group and member of the office of the CEO. "Under Dr. Maupin's guidance, the school has made significant advances, expanding academic programs and clinical affiliations, creating innovative partnerships, modernizing facilities, and strengthening the infrastructure to better support research, patient care and teaching."
Mr. Welters went on to explain, "The board of trustees is confident that the carefully orchestrated succession plan helps to maintain business continuity, provide a seamless transition, and help to facilitate Dr. Montgomery Rice's success as the next leader."
"During her tenure as dean, Dr. Montgomery Rice demonstrated her commitment to the mission and vision of the medical school," said Art R. Collins, chairman of the board of trustees' committee on transition and founding partner of the Collins Johnson Group. "In our selection of Dr. Montgomery Rice as dean, the trustees looked at a long-term strategy. We believed the dean could ascend to leading the medical school and her current role would provide the necessary consistency to continue advancing the mission."
A native of Macon, Ga., Dr. Montgomery Rice, served in numerous leadership positions at some of the nation's most prestigious academic and health institutions. Dr. Montgomery Rice received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Georgia Institute of Technology, a medical degree from Harvard Medical School, and completed her training in obstetrics and gynecology at Emory University Medical School and reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Hutzel Hospital in Detroit. A renowned infertility expert and nationally recognized clinical scientist, Dr. Montgomery Rice also served on numerous professional and scientific advisory panels, national industry boards and authored more than 50 medical research articles.
"I consider it an honor that our board is entrusting me with the responsibility of continuing to build on the legacy of this pre-eminent institution," said Dr. Montgomery Rice. "The vision is crystal clear. My role is to continue to further the mission while also positioning the school to remain relevant and at the forefront of an ever-changing medical education environment."
During the next year, the two leaders will continue to enhance key partnerships, advance development and philanthropic outreach, and maintain a focus on faculty and staff engagement. 
Upon retirement, Dr. Maupin plans to continue to serve on corporate and civic boards. "Being a part of the growth and development of Morehouse School of Medicine has been a remarkable experience," said Dr. Maupin. "Much about MSM is highly distinctive, but what makes it so special is the extraordinarily dedicated faculty and staff, community-focused students, and committed trustees and alumni."
