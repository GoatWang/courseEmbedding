Presidential Realty Corporation
Real Estate Investment Trust






History
 Presidential Realty Corporation is a Delaware corporation organized in 1983 that elected to be treated as a real
                        estate investment trust for Federal and State income tax purposes.
Presidential Realty Corporation was founded in 1909. The company began as a contractor that specialized in
                        building theaters and movie houses in New York City. The company operated as M. Shapiro and Son during this
                        period and built more than eighty cinema houses from 1911-1929. During the 1930’s, Presidential moved into the
                        construction of institutional buildings and worked on such prominent projects as the American Museum of Natural
                        History in New York.
In the 1940’s the company began its move into residential housing, first by becoming a major builder of public
                        housing projects after World War II and then as a developer of thousands of apartment units. Ownership and
                        operation of rental housing became the prime activity of the firm in the 1950’s. Presidential had its IPO in 1961 and
                        was listed on the American Stock Exchange. By 1973, Presidential owned property in twelve states and Puerto Rico,
                        and had total assets in excess of $100 million.
                        Over its history the company had interests
                        in over 10,000 apartments units, in addition to ownership interests in office buildings, industrial properties and
                        shopping centers.
                        The Company's Class A and Class B common stock currently trade in the over-the-counter market under the symbols
                        PDNLA, and PDNLB, respectively.
                    



Presidential Overview
In November of 2011, a new management team took over the operations of Presidential REIT and made a strategic investment in the company.  The new team was led by Nickolas Jekogian, CEO of Signature Group Investments.  The team set in place a strategic plan to reduce operating costs and to implement a growth strategy that focuses on the acquisition and UPREIT of high dividend yielding assets across the country.  




National Expansion Plan
Presidential Realty Corporation, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, is working to develop a portfolio of high dividend yielding assets 
        			   across the nation. We are looking for real estate private equity funds and owner/operators that would be interested in discussing their holdings and the 
        			   potential merits of contributing them into the REIT in exchange for shares in an UPREIT structure. We are seeking partnerships with reputable operators to grow our
                        	   portfolio throughout the United States.
                        
                        For acquisitions please email acquisitions@presrealty.com





UPREIT Overview

Umbrella partnership real estate investment trusts (“UPREIT”) are the primary vehicle for an owner of real property to convert ownership of one or more specific properties into an interest which can be converted into a publicly-traded security.
In the basic UPREIT structure properties are acquired and owned directly or indirectly by the umbrella partnership. The umbrella partnership is the entity through which the REIT operates and collects all income from the properties.  The REIT does not directly own any real estate properties in the UPREIT structure‚ rather it owns interests in the operating partnership by being both its sole general partner and one of its limited partners.
In an UPREIT transaction‚ property owners contribute their properties in exchange for ownership units in the operating partnership (“OP Units”).  Conversion from OP Units to REIT shares is considered a taxable event‚ so the investor may choose to convert over time‚ which enables the investor to incur any tax liability in smaller increments.

UPREIT Structure

 
UPREIT Benefits

Taxes: The owner does not recognize immediate gain on the transaction because the owner does not acquire publicly-traded stock in the REIT, but rather receives units in the operating partnership (“OP Units”).  If the OP Units received from the operating partnership end up in the owner's estate, the ultimate recipients of the units will receive a stepped up basis equal to the value at death or the alternate valuation date and the inherent gain resulting from the UPREIT transaction will not be subject to capital gains or income tax. The tax deferral or avoidance, as the case may be, gives UPREITs a large advantage over cash purchasers. This is particularly true for individuals or entities which have a low tax basis and therefore the potential gain is substantial.
Diversification: A transaction can be structured which enables the property owner to convert an interest in one or more specific properties into an interest in a larger and more balanced portfolio of properties held by the UPREIT.  The portfolio is often diversified as to property type and geography and usually benefits from the economies of scale and management that a larger entity can offer.
Liquidity: The UPREIT structure allows an interest in illiquid individual properties to become more easily saleable.
Stock Appreciation: There is the potential for the stock in the REIT to appreciate beyond the value of the owners’ real estate contribution.  This could potentially deliver higher returns than those achievable from the ownership of one or more specific properties.

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Nov. 8, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- PRESIDENTIAL REALTY CORPORATION (OTCQB: PDNLA) (OTCQB: PDNLB).  Jeffrey Joseph, President and Chief Executive Officer of Presidential Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust that currently trades in the over-the-counter market (the "Company"), announced today that the Company had terminated its Plan of Liquidation and completed a strategic transaction (the "Transaction") with Signature Community Investment Group LLC, its founder, Nickolas W. Jekogian, III, and persons introduced to the Company by Mr. Jekogian.  The purpose of the Transaction is to permit the Company to continue its operations under a new management team and afford the Company an opportunity for growth. The principal features of the Transaction are as follows:
Pdl Partnership, a general partnership of which Mr. Joseph and two directors and former officers of the Company are the general partners and that owned approximately 51% of the Company's outstanding Class A Common Stock, has sold 177,013 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company, representing 40% of the outstanding Class A Shares, to the BBJ Family Irrevocable Trust for a purchase price of $1.00 per share.  The Trust was created by Mr. Jekogian for the benefit of members of his family and Nickolas Jekogian, Jr., Mr. Jekogian's father, is the sole trustee. The holders of the Class A Common Stock have the right to elect two-thirds of the members of the Company's Board of Directors.The Company sold 250,000 shares of newly issued Class B Common Stock, representing 6.8% of the total outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock of the Company after taking the sale into account, to two individuals introduced to the Company by Mr. Jekogian for a purchase price of $1.00 per share.  Steven Baruch, Thomas Viertel and Mortimer Caplin resigned from the Company's Board of Directors and Robert Feder resigned as Chairman of the Board.  Mr. Jekogian, Alexander Ludwig and Jeffrey Rogers (an individual introduced by Mr. Jekogian) were appointed as directors to fill the vacancies on the Board, with Mr. Jekogian elected as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Joseph, Robert Feder and Richard Brandt will continue as members of the Board of Directors but Mr. Joseph will resign as President and Chief Executive officer of the Company prior to the end of November.Mr. Jekogian has been elected as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Ludwig has been elected as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, to take office before the end of November.  The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of them and has issued options to acquire 370,000 shares of Class B Common Stock to each of them at a purchase price of $1.25 per share.The Board of Directors declared a special dividend in the amount of $.35 per share on the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock to be paid on November 28, 2011 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2011 (the "Special Dividend").  The purchasers of the 250,000 Class B shares are not entitled to receive the Special Dividend.  Similarly, the purchaser of the Class A shares is not entitled to retain the Special Dividend, which will be paid over to Pdl Partnership.In order to induce Signature and the purchasers of the Class A and Class B shares to enter into the transactions and to provide liquidity to the Company to pay the Special Dividend, Messrs. Joseph, Baruch and Viertel amended their Employment Agreements with the Company to waive or defer an aggregate of $1,187,500 of the amounts payable to them upon retirement, of which $593,750 was waived permanently and the balance of $593,750 was deferred for a three-year period.  The amounts waived and deferred were in addition to the reductions in the compensation otherwise payable to them upon termination of their employment that were agreed to in August 2010 in connection with the approval by the Board of the Plan of Liquidation.The Company entered into a Property Management Agreement with Signature to be the exclusive managing and leasing agent for the Company's Mapletree Industrial Center property in Palmer, Massachusetts and an Asset Management Agreement with Signature to provide oversight of the Company's Mapletree Industrial Center property and an office building in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.In connection with the Transaction and in light of the plans for the Company presented to the Company's Board of Directors by Messrs. Jekogian and Ludwig and the Board's consideration of the alternatives available to the Company and other matters it deemed relevant, including the tax consequences of the Transaction, the Board of Directors determined that the Transaction will be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than effecting the plan of liquidation and sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and pursuant to the discretion given to the Board of Directors by the stockholders in the Plan of Liquidation, terminated the Plan of Liquidation approved by the stockholders on January 20, 2011. Mr. Joseph said that the Board of Directors was pleased to welcome Mr. Jekogian, Mr. Ludwig and Mr. Rogers as members of the Board and was looking forward to their leadership in moving the Company forward.
Mr. Jekogian said that he and Mr. Ludwig, together with the Signature team, were excited by the opportunity to stabilize the existing assets and contribute to the future growth of Presidential and that he looked forward to working with the Board of Directors.     
Mr. Jekogian is the founder, owner and President of Signature Community Investment Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with its affiliates, "Signature"), an integrated real estate company focused on multi family rental properties in urban areas.  Mr. Jekogian also has more than 15 years experience developing commercial projects in the New York and Philadelphia Metropolitan areas for retail chains.  Mr. Jekogian will not be exclusive to the Company.  He will continue to own and operate Signature.  The Company's independent directors will review all transactions between the Company and Signature and the activities of Mr. Jekogian.
Mr. Ludwig has provided consulting services for Signature since February 2011.  He worked at Urban Real Estate Growth Fund LLC from the beginning of 2009 until October 2011, where he oversaw new real estate investments.  Prior to joining Urban Real Estate Growth Fund LLC, Mr. Ludwig worked from 2003 to 2008 for ADG Capital LLC, where he oversaw multiple real estate development projects.  Mr. Ludwig previously held various positions in banking where he structured debt and corporate finance transactions.  Mr. Ludwig will continue to provide consulting services to and receive compensation from Signature.  Mr. Ludwig has agreed to keep the independent directors of the Board advised of his activities for and compensation from Signature.

This plan was outlined in our strategic partnership with Forum Partners earlier this year." Mr. Singal further stated, "It is our goal to effectuate FCRETI's liquidity plan through this transaction and other events in the near future." In connection with executing the Letter of Intent, the parties entered into a mutual 60-day standstill agreement.








The proposed transaction is subject to, among other things, satisfaction by the parties with the results of their due diligence investigations, approval by the Boards of Directors of FCRETI and Presidential and FCRETI shareholders of final terms, and as such, there can be no assurance that a transaction will be consummated.

How Harvard Business Services, Inc. Works





Message From the Chairman:

Welcome to DelawareInc.com. You've come to the right place to form your Delaware LLC or set up a Delaware corporation.

Once your company is formed, we'll be your Delaware Registered Agent for the life of your company. Our annual Registered Agent Fee is the lowest in the industry—only $50 per year, per company, and we do something no other Registered Agent does: we guarantee your Registered Agent Fee will remain fixed at $50 per year. We've held to that guarantee for more than 3 decades and we'll hold to it for the life of the company you form with us.
We'll remind you every year at Delaware Franchise Tax time, and even offer to take care of your tax filing for you for a small fee, guaranteeing on-time payment and ensuring your company remains in compliance and good standing with the state of Delaware.

What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax is the fee imposed by the state of Delaware for the right or privilege to own a Delaware company. The tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of Delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company.
 
The term "Franchise Tax" does not imply that your company is a franchise business. 



When Is It Due?
The due date of your tax varies, depending on your company type.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is due by March 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before March 1, the state imposes a $125 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware LLC is due by June 1 of every year. The limited partnership (LP) Franchise Tax is also due by June 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before June 1, the state imposes a $200 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
Corporations, LLCs and LPs are taxed in arrears, meaning the tax due by each due date is for the previous calendar year.



How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) or Delaware limited partnership (LP) is a flat annual rate of $300 as of July 1, 2014.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is a little more complicated. It is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has. The total cost of the Franchise Tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due.
 
A non-stock/non-profit company is considered exempt with the state of Delaware. This type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee. The annual report fee is $25 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,000 authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax is $175 as of July 1, 2014, for a total of $225 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,001 authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax would be somewhere between $200 and $180,000 per year.
 
There are two methods to calculate a maximum stock company's Franchise Tax. They are:


The Authorized Shares Method
 
The state of Delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes. This method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares. The calculation is as follows:

5,000 shares or less: $175 (as of July 1, 2014)
5,001 - 10,000 shares: $250 (as of July 1, 2014)
Additional 10,000 shares or portion thereof: add $75
The maximum annual tax is $180,000

 
Don't forget to add the $50 annual report fee to the Franchise Tax after it is calculated.
 


The Assumed Par Value Capital Method
The state of Delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods. Therefore, if you receive a bill from Delaware for tens of thousands of dollars, it may be in your best interest to try calculating your Franchise Tax with the assumed par value capital method.
 
In order to utilize this filing method, you will need to provide the company's total gross assets (as reported on the Form 1120, Schedule L) and the total number of issued shares. Many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of $350 Franchise Tax plus the $50 annual report fee.
 
The calculation used for this method is more complex. Please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you. We will be happy to help you with this calculation.



How Do I Pay My Franchise Tax?
We make it easy to pay your Franchise Tax online.
 
As your Registered Agent,we will send you tax reminders both by mail and email, well in advance of the due date. We offer a tax filing service for a small fee of $49 plus your Franchise Tax. We also offer an online discounted filing fee that ranges from $29 to $59, depending on when the online payment is submitted.
 
Payments can be submitted via our online Franchise Tax payment form.
 
You can also email or fax (302- 645-1280) us your LLC/LP Franchise Tax worksheet or your corporation Franchise Tax worksheet. If you would like to make your payment by phone, call us at 800-345-2677, Ext. 6904.
 
 
 




 
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Yes. Corporations must complete an annual report along with their Franchise Tax payment. This report must list the company's physical address (not a P.O. box and not your Registered Agent's address); the name and physical address of at least one director; and, if there are any officers, the name, title and physical address of one of the officers.
 
If the tax is being calculated with the assumed par value capital method, the gross assets and issued shares are also to be listed. If you decide to pay your Delaware Franchise Tax for a corporation with us over the phone, the annual report would then need to be separately submitted to us by email, fax or mail.



Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
The Delaware Franchise Tax and the Registered Agent Fee are two separate, unrelated fees. The annual Franchise Tax is imposed by the state of Delaware. The annual Registered Agent Fee is paid to Harvard Business Services, Inc. to act as an agent for your entity in the state .
 
Our annual Registered Agent Fee is $50 per year, and is due on the anniversary month of the formation of your company.  It is the lowest Registered Agent fee in the industry, and it is guaranteed to remain fixed at $50 per year, as long as the fee is paid on time and your company remains in good standing with the state of Delaware.

What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?
After paying Franchise Tax, many business owners require a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing.
 
A Certificate of Good Standing is a document sent directly from the Delaware Secretary of State certifying the date the company was formed in the state of Delaware, that the company is current with all Delaware taxes and that the company is in good standing.
 
This is not the same as your annual report and will not mention internal company information, such as director or officer details.
 
We can assist you in obtaining this document. To purchase a Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Good Standing order page.
 
If you have any additional questions or concerns about the Delaware Franchise Tax, please feel free to call 1-800-345-2677, Ext. 6904 or email us.

Delaware Certificate of Good Standing

Order Your Certificate Now 
The Delaware Certificate of Good Standing is also known as a Certificate of Existence.
 
It is a letter provided by the Delaware Secretary of State that declares that a company is in good standing with the state. It specifically lists the incorporation date, good standing status for a corporation or LLC and whether taxes are current for a corporation or LLC.
 
 Order Your Certificate Now  
(If you already know you need to order a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Delaware Certificate of Good Standing order page. If you'd like to learn more, read on.)
 
Typically, a Certificate of Good Standing is required in order to open a corporate bank account, purchase or sell real estate, obtain a loan, obtain a Certificate of Authority to operate in another state, merge with another company and more.
 
Since the certified document verifies that a company is in good standing on the date it was issued, authorities will generally accept it as proof that the business is valid for 30-60 days after the issue date. Beyond 60 days, however, a new Certificate of Good Standing may need to be ordered.
 
Please click the buttons below to view a sample of a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing—with and without an Apostille.
 

 

Due to the time sensitivity of the Certificate, it is better to order one when you know you'll need it. If you are in a hurry, we can obtain a Certificate for you in two hours if necessary.
 
This certificate can be issued only for companies in good standing with the state of Delaware. If your company owes Delaware Franchise Taxes, they must be paid in full before we can order your Certificate of Good Standing.
 
You may email customer support, call 1-800-345-2677 or live chat with a specialist to determine if your company owes a tax balance.
 
To order a Certificate of Good Standing for your corporation or LLC, please view our pricing options, which start at $99, and then click on the yellow button below:
