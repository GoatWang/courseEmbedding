Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]

Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.

Jung Joon-young (born February 21, 1989) is a South Korean singer-songwriter, radio DJ, host, actor, and television personality. He first gained recognition in Mnet's reality television talent show, Superstar K4 (2012), where he finished third place.[1] In 2013, he became the youngest member of KBS's variety show 2 Days & 1 Night Season 3. He hosted his own radio program titled MBC FM's Jung Joon-young's Simsimtapa (2014) and made his big screen debut in Love Forecast (2015). Since 2015, Jung is the lead vocalist of a rock band, JJY Band, which changed their name to Drug Restaurant since May 20, 2016.[2]
Since his official debut with the release of 1st Mini Album in October 2013, Jung has won the "New Male Solo Artist" award for its title track "이별 10분전 (The Sense of an Ending)" at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. He then released the self-produced 2nd mini album, Teenager, which contained six self-composed tracks on June 26, 2014.[3] Jung had his Taiwan fan meeting in 2013 and followed it with his first overseas showcase in Taipei in July 2014. He performed the self-written "하루만 (I’m Nobody)" at the Pretty Man OST Japan Concert in July 2014. He held a concert tour in China in November 2014 and performed in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai.[4] Jung made his American concert debut during K-CON 2014 as a performer and host.[5] In 2015, he formed Drug Restaurant (JJY Band)[6] which released their first album, Escape to Hangover, in May 2015.[7]

Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]
2013: Official debut and 1st Mini Album[edit]
After Superstar K4, he has been doing concerts, TV and radio programs(as a guest or a host), and modeling for cars, clothes, games, N-screen, and beer.

His 1st mini album was a moderate success. The album ranked the top spot both on the daily and weekly chart of Synnara Record during its first week. In addition, "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" landed at the third place and "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분전)" also took the second place on the chart of MBC's music show "Music Core".
Jung Joon-young‘s popularity has been gradually expanding abroad. He visited Taiwan in order to promote his 1st mini album on December 8, 2013. He held a successful fan meeting with 1,000 Taiwanese fans and had an autograph signing event with his song performances for those who had purchased a special limited edition of his album and he gave them a good impression by communicating in Chinese fluently.[29]

Later, Jung debuted a rock band called 'Jung Joon Young Band' (JJY Band). His band is made up of himself and three musicians, guitarist DammIt, bassist Seok Won, and drummer Drok.Q. JJY Band released their first album Escape to Hangover which consists of eight tracks including the title track "OMG" on May 27, 2015.

2016: New label, Sympathy and Mistake[edit]
A representative from CJ E&M announced that their contract with Jung Joon Young expired in November 2015.[51] Jung decided to not renew his contract with CJ E&M.

On February 19, Jung announced his comeback with the solo album, 공감 (Sympathy). On the same day, he released a music video teaser of his new single. He picked soft rock as the main sound for his new solo album. 공감 (Sympathy), the title track, is a duet song recorded with Korean singer, Seo Young-eun. It was written, composed, and produced by Jung Joon-young. He also wrote, composed, and produced another track in the album and included his broad musical abilities in the album.

C9 Entertainment announced on May 20 that JJY Band will officially change their name to Drug Restaurant. They decided to change the band's name because they want to go with a name that focuses on the band altogether rather than centering it around the front-man vocalist, Jung Joon Young. The name "Drug Restaurant" means that through their music, the band hopes to become a source of medicine, healing, or escape for its listeners, by prescribing medicine better than a pharmacy.[58][59]
Drug Restaurant released their second album, Mistake, on May 27 through digital download and on June 9 through physical album (CD). Their new album consists of five tracks including the title track Mistake. All songs in the album were written, composed, and arranged by the band members themselves.[60][61] Drug Restaurant released the music video for Mistake on June 8.[62]

The album consists of nine tracks including intro, outro, five new songs and two songs from his previous single album, 공감 (Sympathy). All songs in the album were written, composed and arranged by Jung Joon Young. The producer of this album are Jung Joon Young and Lee Jihyun.[65] Jung’s new album is released digitally on online sites on February 7 at midnight KST. The music video for his title track 나와 너 (Me and You) is also shared at that time on Jung's official Youtube channel.[66] On February 18, Jung's agency announced that the Chinese version of his first full album, The First Person, was released digitally on iTunes and KKBox that day in 4 countries, Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia. While the physical CD will be released on March 17. The Chinese version consists of 12 tracks, which included 9 songs from the Korean version of the album and 3 Chinese translated songs, Sympathy, Amy, and Me and You.[67]
Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.

Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]
2013: Official debut and 1st Mini Album[edit]
After Superstar K4, he has been doing concerts, TV and radio programs(as a guest or a host), and modeling for cars, clothes, games, N-screen, and beer. From May 6, 2013, he worked as a DJ for MBC FM4U "Close Friend" until September 1, 2013. He has appeared in several TV shows including KBS2's "Immortal Song-Singing the Legend 불후의 명곡", "Happy Together", MBC's "Radio Star", and "We Got Married (Season 4)". He has been featured on KBS's "2 Days & 1 Night Season 3" since Dec 1, 2013.
On May 21, 2013, Jung Joon-young finally contracted with CJ E&M after receiving many offers from numerous entertainment companies.[25][26][27]
After signing with CJ E&M, Jung Joon-young released his debut single "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" with two versions of Music Video(N version and S version) on Oct 01, 2013. It immediately made an impact on the country's charts. Just an hour after release, "Spotless Mind" nabbed the top spot on Mnet, Bugs, and Soribada etc.[28]
On October 10, 2013, Jung Joon-Young officially made his debut by releasing his first mini album that consists of six songs containing the title track, "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분 전)", and two songs that he participated in writing and composing: "Missed Call (아는 번호)" and "Take off Mask". His 1st mini album was a moderate success. The album ranked the top spot both on the daily and weekly chart of Synnara Record during its first week. In addition, "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" landed at the third place and "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분전)" also took the second place on the chart of MBC's music show "Music Core".
Jung Joon-young‘s popularity has been gradually expanding abroad. He visited Taiwan in order to promote his 1st mini album on December 8, 2013. He held a successful fan meeting with 1,000 Taiwanese fans and had an autograph signing event with his song performances for those who had purchased a special limited edition of his album and he gave them a good impression by communicating in Chinese fluently.[29]
Jung Joon-young earned New Male Solo Artist for "이별 10분전 (The Sense of an Ending)" and Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year for "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Plus, he earned Star of the Year at the MBC Entertainment Awards.

2015: Movie debut, JJY Band, and Escape to Hangover[edit]
Jung Joon-young made his big screen debut through a light-hearted romantic comedy film Love Forecast, which opened in theaters on Jan. 15, 2015.[42] Jung next starred in The Lover, a 19+ drama aired by Mnet. He played as an unknown musician who is both living and dating a woman 12 years older than him.[43] Later, he had a cameo in the 10th episode of the drama The Producers, with Roy Kim as an anti-fan.
Later, Jung debuted a rock band called 'Jung Joon Young Band' (JJY Band). His band is made up of himself and three musicians, guitarist DammIt, bassist Seok Won, and drummer Drok.Q. JJY Band released their first album Escape to Hangover which consists of eight tracks including the title track "OMG" on May 27, 2015. Brian Howes, a producer who had worked with American rock band Bon Jovi, produced the title song OMG, which was composed by Jung Joon Young and Vanilla Unity's Lee Seung Joo. Lee was also the executive producer for the album.[44][45] Their debut album got positive reviews from music fans and critics.[46] JJY Band held their very first solo concert in December 2015 with the name "JJY Band's Live & Talk 2015 'Attention'".[47] Their first show was held in Tokyo on December 13.[48] They continued to perform in Shanghai on December 26 and Seoul on December 30–31.
Jung next joined a new variety show called "Old House, New House" aired by JTBC as a cast member. The show features celebrities paired up with professional designers to provide home decoration and improvement, where each week, two groups will compete with each other to see which home makeover is the best.[49][50]
2016: New label, Sympathy and Mistake[edit]
A representative from CJ E&M announced that their contract with Jung Joon Young expired in November 2015.[51] Jung decided to not renew his contract with CJ E&M. On January 5, 2016, C9 Entertainment announced that Jung and his band officially signed an exclusive contract with their label, REALIVE.[52] Under the new label, JJY Band announced that they will hold their first nationwide tour.[53] Their first show kicked off in Daejeon on February 5 and Busan on February 6, then continued to Seoul on February 20 and 21.
On February 19, Jung announced his comeback with the solo album, 공감 (Sympathy). On the same day, he released a music video teaser of his new single. He picked soft rock as the main sound for his new solo album. 공감 (Sympathy), the title track, is a duet song recorded with Korean singer, Seo Young-eun. It was written, composed, and produced by Jung Joon-young. He also wrote, composed, and produced another track in the album and included his broad musical abilities in the album. Jung unveiled his new songs for the first time during JJY Band's concert on February 20 and 21 at the Art Hall of Lottecard Art Center in Seoul. 공감 (Sympathy) was officially released on February 24 along with the music video of the title track.[54] On February 26, Jung released the music video for the second track in the album, Amy.[55]
tvN announced on March 7 that Jung will join their cooking show, 집밥 백선생 2 (Mr. Baek The Homemade Food Master Season 2), as one of the casts where he will learn from Baek Jong-won, a popular Korean chef, about the art of home cooking.[56] On March 30, JTBC announced that Jung will team up with Kangin, Jeong Jinwoon, and Lee Chul Woo for a new reality show, Hitmaker, in which they’ll be travelling overseas to try other countries' sports.[57]
C9 Entertainment announced on May 20 that JJY Band will officially change their name to Drug Restaurant. They decided to change the band's name because they want to go with a name that focuses on the band altogether rather than centering it around the front-man vocalist, Jung Joon Young. The name "Drug Restaurant" means that through their music, the band hopes to become a source of medicine, healing, or escape for its listeners, by prescribing medicine better than a pharmacy.[58][59]
Drug Restaurant released their second album, Mistake, on May 27 through digital download and on June 9 through physical album (CD). Their new album consists of five tracks including the title track Mistake. All songs in the album were written, composed, and arranged by the band members themselves.[60][61] Drug Restaurant released the music video for Mistake on June 8.[62]
2017: The First Person[edit]
On January 31, Jung Joon Young announced through his Instagram account that he will release his first full album which is titled 1인칭 (The First Person). Along with the announcement, he posted the first image teaser for his new album.[63] On February 1, C9 Entertainment announced that 나와 너 (Me and You) will be the title track for Jung's new album. 나와 너 (Me and You) is a ballad song featuring a senior Korean singer, Jang Hye-jin.[64] Two days later, Jung's agency revealed the tracklist of the album through their Twitter account. The album consists of nine tracks including intro, outro, five new songs and two songs from his previous single album, 공감 (Sympathy). All songs in the album were written, composed and arranged by Jung Joon Young. The producer of this album are Jung Joon Young and Lee Jihyun.[65] Jung’s new album is released digitally on online sites on February 7 at midnight KST. The music video for his title track 나와 너 (Me and You) is also shared at that time on Jung's official Youtube channel.[66] On February 18, Jung's agency announced that the Chinese version of his first full album, The First Person, was released digitally on iTunes and KKBox that day in 4 countries, Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia. While the physical CD will be released on March 17. The Chinese version consists of 12 tracks, which included 9 songs from the Korean version of the album and 3 Chinese translated songs, Sympathy, Amy, and Me and You.[67]
Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.

Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]
2013: Official debut and 1st Mini Album[edit]
After Superstar K4, he has been doing concerts, TV and radio programs(as a guest or a host), and modeling for cars, clothes, games, N-screen, and beer.

It immediately made an impact on the country's charts. Just an hour after release, "Spotless Mind" nabbed the top spot on Mnet, Bugs, and Soribada etc.[28]
On October 10, 2013, Jung Joon-Young officially made his debut by releasing his first mini album that consists of six songs containing the title track, "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분 전)", and two songs that he participated in writing and composing: "Missed Call (아는 번호)" and "Take off Mask". His 1st mini album was a moderate success. The album ranked the top spot both on the daily and weekly chart of Synnara Record during its first week. In addition, "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" landed at the third place and "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분전)" also took the second place on the chart of MBC's music show "Music Core".
Jung Joon-young‘s popularity has been gradually expanding abroad. He visited Taiwan in order to promote his 1st mini album on December 8, 2013. He held a successful fan meeting with 1,000 Taiwanese fans and had an autograph signing event with his song performances for those who had purchased a special limited edition of his album and he gave them a good impression by communicating in Chinese fluently.[29]

2017: The First Person[edit]
On January 31, Jung Joon Young announced through his Instagram account that he will release his first full album which is titled 1인칭 (The First Person). Along with the announcement, he posted the first image teaser for his new album.[63] On February 1, C9 Entertainment announced that 나와 너 (Me and You) will be the title track for Jung's new album. 나와 너 (Me and You) is a ballad song featuring a senior Korean singer, Jang Hye-jin.[64] Two days later, Jung's agency revealed the tracklist of the album through their Twitter account. The album consists of nine tracks including intro, outro, five new songs and two songs from his previous single album, 공감 (Sympathy). All songs in the album were written, composed and arranged by Jung Joon Young. The producer of this album are Jung Joon Young and Lee Jihyun.[65] Jung’s new album is released digitally on online sites on February 7 at midnight KST. The music video for his title track 나와 너 (Me and You) is also shared at that time on Jung's official Youtube channel.[66] On February 18, Jung's agency announced that the Chinese version of his first full album, The First Person, was released digitally on iTunes and KKBox that day in 4 countries, Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia. While the physical CD will be released on March 17. The Chinese version consists of 12 tracks, which included 9 songs from the Korean version of the album and 3 Chinese translated songs, Sympathy, Amy, and Me and You.[67]
Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.

Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]

Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.

Jung Joon-young (born February 21, 1989) is a South Korean singer-songwriter, radio DJ, host, actor, and television personality. He first gained recognition in Mnet's reality television talent show, Superstar K4 (2012), where he finished third place.[1] In 2013, he became the youngest member of KBS's variety show 2 Days & 1 Night Season 3. He hosted his own radio program titled MBC FM's Jung Joon-young's Simsimtapa (2014) and made his big screen debut in Love Forecast (2015). Since 2015, Jung is the lead vocalist of a rock band, JJY Band, which changed their name to Drug Restaurant since May 20, 2016.[2]
Since his official debut with the release of 1st Mini Album in October 2013, Jung has won the "New Male Solo Artist" award for its title track "이별 10분전 (The Sense of an Ending)" at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. He then released the self-produced 2nd mini album, Teenager, which contained six self-composed tracks on June 26, 2014.[3] Jung had his Taiwan fan meeting in 2013 and followed it with his first overseas showcase in Taipei in July 2014. He performed the self-written "하루만 (I’m Nobody)" at the Pretty Man OST Japan Concert in July 2014. He held a concert tour in China in November 2014 and performed in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai.[4] Jung made his American concert debut during K-CON 2014 as a performer and host.[5] In 2015, he formed Drug Restaurant (JJY Band)[6] which released their first album, Escape to Hangover, in May 2015.[7]

Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]
2013: Official debut and 1st Mini Album[edit]

His 1st mini album was a moderate success. The album ranked the top spot both on the daily and weekly chart of Synnara Record during its first week. In addition, "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" landed at the third place and "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분전)" also took the second place on the chart of MBC's music show "Music Core".
Jung Joon-young‘s popularity has been gradually expanding abroad. He visited Taiwan in order to promote his 1st mini album on December 8, 2013. He held a successful fan meeting with 1,000 Taiwanese fans and had an autograph signing event with his song performances for those who had purchased a special limited edition of his album and he gave them a good impression by communicating in Chinese fluently.[29]

Later, Jung debuted a rock band called 'Jung Joon Young Band' (JJY Band). His band is made up of himself and three musicians, guitarist DammIt, bassist Seok Won, and drummer Drok.Q. JJY Band released their first album Escape to Hangover which consists of eight tracks including the title track "OMG" on May 27, 2015.

2016: New label, Sympathy and Mistake[edit]
A representative from CJ E&M announced that their contract with Jung Joon Young expired in November 2015.[51] Jung decided to not renew his contract with CJ E&M.

On February 19, Jung announced his comeback with the solo album, 공감 (Sympathy). On the same day, he released a music video teaser of his new single. He picked soft rock as the main sound for his new solo album. 공감 (Sympathy), the title track, is a duet song recorded with Korean singer, Seo Young-eun. It was written, composed, and produced by Jung Joon-young. He also wrote, composed, and produced another track in the album and included his broad musical abilities in the album.

C9 Entertainment announced on May 20 that JJY Band will officially change their name to Drug Restaurant. They decided to change the band's name because they want to go with a name that focuses on the band altogether rather than centering it around the front-man vocalist, Jung Joon Young. The name "Drug Restaurant" means that through their music, the band hopes to become a source of medicine, healing, or escape for its listeners, by prescribing medicine better than a pharmacy.[58][59]
Drug Restaurant released their second album, Mistake, on May 27 through digital download and on June 9 through physical album (CD). Their new album consists of five tracks including the title track Mistake. All songs in the album were written, composed, and arranged by the band members themselves.[60][61] Drug Restaurant released the music video for Mistake on June 8.[62]
2017: The First Person[edit]
On January 31, Jung Joon Young announced through his Instagram account that he will release his first full album which is titled 1인칭 (The First Person).

The album consists of nine tracks including intro, outro, five new songs and two songs from his previous single album, 공감 (Sympathy). All songs in the album were written, composed and arranged by Jung Joon Young. The producer of this album are Jung Joon Young and Lee Jihyun.[65] Jung’s new album is released digitally on online sites on February 7 at midnight KST. The music video for his title track 나와 너 (Me and You) is also shared at that time on Jung's official Youtube channel.[66] On February 18, Jung's agency announced that the Chinese version of his first full album, The First Person, was released digitally on iTunes and KKBox that day in 4 countries, Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia. While the physical CD will be released on March 17. The Chinese version consists of 12 tracks, which included 9 songs from the Korean version of the album and 3 Chinese translated songs, Sympathy, Amy, and Me and You.[67]
Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.

Early life[edit]
Jung Joon-young was born on February 21, 1989 in Jakarta. He grew up in Indonesia, China, Japan, France and Philippines.[8][9] He is the youngest son of Jung Hak-chun and Choi Jong-sook. His father was an international businessman who travelled to many countries for his business. Jung had a lonely childhood in many different countries but he learned to speak five different languages such as English, Mandarin, Korean,[10] conversational Japanese, and Tagalog. He couldn't enroll in a regular school due to frequent moves. He took private lessons for regular subjects such as Math, English, violin, and piano. He also got his fourth degree black belt in Taekwondo.
When Jung turned 17, he decided to go to the Philippines to do missionary work. He taught Taekwondo and music to the local children. He was a member of the choir which performed in front of the former president of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He stated that he got inspired by Kurt Cobain and was determined to become a rock star after he watched Nirvana's MTV Unplugged Show when he was a teenager.[11][12]
Career[edit]
2008–2012: Beginnings[edit]

Indie Bands period

He moved to South Korea the next year to start his musical career and soon signed to an entertainment agency (supposed to be Danal Entertainment which released Jung Joon-young's solo EP titled "Rock Trip" in 2010 as well as Digital Single "환상Fantasy" in 2012).
In 2008, Starkim Entertainment selected Jung Joon-young as a vocalist of LEDApple.[13] As one of the original members, he went through the training process and even finished recording the debut album with the band. But, right before Led Apple's debut in 2010, Starkim Entertainment discovered that Jung was already under contract with the previous agency which refused to release him and, thus, he was dropped from the idol rock band.[14]
In 2010, Jung Joon Young dove into the Hongdae indie music scene and formed various bands such as "Flower Mist" which busked in Japan and "Switch On" which performed for amateur club theaters.
As a struggling musician, he modeled for several online shopping malls. He was also on an advertisement for "BGF retail" (franchise retail) and participated in other artists' music-videos such as "Liquor Bottle" (술병 by Haha).[15] [16] Jung Joon-young appeared on a TV show "Ulzzang Generation 얼짱시대 Season 5" (Ep.1~Ep.8)[17][18] and referring to this show, he said, "People don't like this program because they think this is just about good looking boys and girls chatting on a TV show, but it was a good opportunity for me to make money."

Since his band, "Switch On" was little known to the public, Jung Joon-young tried to take part in Superstar K4 with "Switch On" members to gain more popularity as a band, but they couldn't continue the audition together due to some foreign members' visa problems. Thus, he decided to carry on the audition as a solo artist.
During the Superweek (which was the selection round), his low husky voice, appearance, and unpredictable character trait appealed to the viewers as well as the judges, especially one of the judges, PSY who is famous for "Gangnam Style" (he left Superstar K4 after 1st final for the world tour). Moreover, his collaboration with Roy Kim covering "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" by (Kim Kwang-Suk), which Jung Joon-young changed the ballad to the rock version, became a big hit and the best duet audition song ever.[19][20] After releasing, it achieved an "all-kill" on real-time charts and won the Mnet 20's Choice Hot Cover as well as 2013's Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Even though he was at risk of dropping out several times, he passed through into the finals by Psy's choice in the judge's final decision.
Throughout the final stages, he stuck to rock style as his only musical style. He was repeatedly suggested to that he needed to try a different genre of music, such as ballad, by the judges. However, on the other hand, his persistence about rock music impressed a lot of viewers, and, as a result, it help him to establish a strong fandom. He was able to survive the third stage through a large number of phone votes. His covers that represented his rock style were "매일매일 기다려 Waiting Everyday"(TeeSams), "Bed of Roses"(Bon Jovi), and "Outsider" "(Bom-Yeoreum-Gaeul-Gyeoul 봄여름가을겨울)[21] which performance received a positive response from the judges and audience. On the fifth stage, he was urged to sing a rock ballad "응급실 Emergency Room" (IZI)[22] which had been chosen by the viewers regardless of his musical taste. Unexpectedly, it highly ranked and topped on various online charts and also earned favorable reactions from the public.[23]
Though he was eliminated in the six stage of the semi-final as Top 3, Superstar K4 allowed the public to recognize his musical style. He even mentioned that "Superstar K4 was the turning point in my music career. Before I tried out for Superstar K4, only those who liked rock music listened to my songs. However, now a more variety of people listen to my music and acknowledge me. I'm glad I got to make myself known through Superstar K4" through his farewell interview."[24]
2013: Official debut and 1st Mini Album[edit]
After Superstar K4, he has been doing concerts, TV and radio programs(as a guest or a host), and modeling for cars, clothes, games, N-screen, and beer. From May 6, 2013, he worked as a DJ for MBC FM4U "Close Friend" until September 1, 2013. He has appeared in several TV shows including KBS2's "Immortal Song-Singing the Legend 불후의 명곡", "Happy Together", MBC's "Radio Star", and "We Got Married (Season 4)". He has been featured on KBS's "2 Days & 1 Night Season 3" since Dec 1, 2013.
On May 21, 2013, Jung Joon-young finally contracted with CJ E&M after receiving many offers from numerous entertainment companies.[25][26][27]
After signing with CJ E&M, Jung Joon-young released his debut single "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" with two versions of Music Video(N version and S version) on Oct 01, 2013. It immediately made an impact on the country's charts. Just an hour after release, "Spotless Mind" nabbed the top spot on Mnet, Bugs, and Soribada etc.[28]
On October 10, 2013, Jung Joon-Young officially made his debut by releasing his first mini album that consists of six songs containing the title track, "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분 전)", and two songs that he participated in writing and composing: "Missed Call (아는 번호)" and "Take off Mask". His 1st mini album was a moderate success. The album ranked the top spot both on the daily and weekly chart of Synnara Record during its first week. In addition, "Spotless Mind (병이에요)" landed at the third place and "The Sense of an Ending (이별 10분전)" also took the second place on the chart of MBC's music show "Music Core".
Jung Joon-young‘s popularity has been gradually expanding abroad. He visited Taiwan in order to promote his 1st mini album on December 8, 2013. He held a successful fan meeting with 1,000 Taiwanese fans and had an autograph signing event with his song performances for those who had purchased a special limited edition of his album and he gave them a good impression by communicating in Chinese fluently.[29]
Jung Joon-young earned New Male Solo Artist for "이별 10분전 (The Sense of an Ending)" and Most Popular Karaoke Song of the Year for "먼지가 되어 (Becoming Dust)" at the 3rd Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards. Plus, he earned Star of the Year at the MBC Entertainment Awards.

2015: Movie debut, JJY Band, and Escape to Hangover[edit]
Jung Joon-young made his big screen debut through a light-hearted romantic comedy film Love Forecast, which opened in theaters on Jan. 15, 2015.[42] Jung next starred in The Lover, a 19+ drama aired by Mnet. He played as an unknown musician who is both living and dating a woman 12 years older than him.[43] Later, he had a cameo in the 10th episode of the drama The Producers, with Roy Kim as an anti-fan.
Later, Jung debuted a rock band called 'Jung Joon Young Band' (JJY Band). His band is made up of himself and three musicians, guitarist DammIt, bassist Seok Won, and drummer Drok.Q. JJY Band released their first album Escape to Hangover which consists of eight tracks including the title track "OMG" on May 27, 2015. Brian Howes, a producer who had worked with American rock band Bon Jovi, produced the title song OMG, which was composed by Jung Joon Young and Vanilla Unity's Lee Seung Joo. Lee was also the executive producer for the album.[44][45] Their debut album got positive reviews from music fans and critics.[46] JJY Band held their very first solo concert in December 2015 with the name "JJY Band's Live & Talk 2015 'Attention'".[47] Their first show was held in Tokyo on December 13.[48] They continued to perform in Shanghai on December 26 and Seoul on December 30–31.
Jung next joined a new variety show called "Old House, New House" aired by JTBC as a cast member. The show features celebrities paired up with professional designers to provide home decoration and improvement, where each week, two groups will compete with each other to see which home makeover is the best.[49][50]
2016: New label, Sympathy and Mistake[edit]
A representative from CJ E&M announced that their contract with Jung Joon Young expired in November 2015.[51] Jung decided to not renew his contract with CJ E&M. On January 5, 2016, C9 Entertainment announced that Jung and his band officially signed an exclusive contract with their label, REALIVE.[52] Under the new label, JJY Band announced that they will hold their first nationwide tour.[53] Their first show kicked off in Daejeon on February 5 and Busan on February 6, then continued to Seoul on February 20 and 21.
On February 19, Jung announced his comeback with the solo album, 공감 (Sympathy). On the same day, he released a music video teaser of his new single. He picked soft rock as the main sound for his new solo album. 공감 (Sympathy), the title track, is a duet song recorded with Korean singer, Seo Young-eun. It was written, composed, and produced by Jung Joon-young. He also wrote, composed, and produced another track in the album and included his broad musical abilities in the album. Jung unveiled his new songs for the first time during JJY Band's concert on February 20 and 21 at the Art Hall of Lottecard Art Center in Seoul. 공감 (Sympathy) was officially released on February 24 along with the music video of the title track.[54] On February 26, Jung released the music video for the second track in the album, Amy.[55]
tvN announced on March 7 that Jung will join their cooking show, 집밥 백선생 2 (Mr. Baek The Homemade Food Master Season 2), as one of the casts where he will learn from Baek Jong-won, a popular Korean chef, about the art of home cooking.[56] On March 30, JTBC announced that Jung will team up with Kangin, Jeong Jinwoon, and Lee Chul Woo for a new reality show, Hitmaker, in which they’ll be travelling overseas to try other countries' sports.[57]
C9 Entertainment announced on May 20 that JJY Band will officially change their name to Drug Restaurant. They decided to change the band's name because they want to go with a name that focuses on the band altogether rather than centering it around the front-man vocalist, Jung Joon Young. The name "Drug Restaurant" means that through their music, the band hopes to become a source of medicine, healing, or escape for its listeners, by prescribing medicine better than a pharmacy.[58][59]
Drug Restaurant released their second album, Mistake, on May 27 through digital download and on June 9 through physical album (CD). Their new album consists of five tracks including the title track Mistake. All songs in the album were written, composed, and arranged by the band members themselves.[60][61] Drug Restaurant released the music video for Mistake on June 8.[62]
2017: The First Person[edit]
On January 31, Jung Joon Young announced through his Instagram account that he will release his first full album which is titled 1인칭 (The First Person). Along with the announcement, he posted the first image teaser for his new album.[63] On February 1, C9 Entertainment announced that 나와 너 (Me and You) will be the title track for Jung's new album. 나와 너 (Me and You) is a ballad song featuring a senior Korean singer, Jang Hye-jin.[64] Two days later, Jung's agency revealed the tracklist of the album through their Twitter account. The album consists of nine tracks including intro, outro, five new songs and two songs from his previous single album, 공감 (Sympathy). All songs in the album were written, composed and arranged by Jung Joon Young. The producer of this album are Jung Joon Young and Lee Jihyun.[65] Jung’s new album is released digitally on online sites on February 7 at midnight KST. The music video for his title track 나와 너 (Me and You) is also shared at that time on Jung's official Youtube channel.[66] On February 18, Jung's agency announced that the Chinese version of his first full album, The First Person, was released digitally on iTunes and KKBox that day in 4 countries, Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia. While the physical CD will be released on March 17. The Chinese version consists of 12 tracks, which included 9 songs from the Korean version of the album and 3 Chinese translated songs, Sympathy, Amy, and Me and You.[67]
Artistry[edit]

Influence

Jung Joon-young's music is rooted in alternative rock. Jung Joon-young stated that he was inspired to be rock musician after watching Nirvana's performance in MTV Unplugged when he was a teenager. Since then, he listened to many rock musicians from western rock bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, to Japanese rock bands like L'Arc-en-Ciel and Vamps.
The influences of Japanese rock and soft rock were particularly apparent on his solo albums. Jung's vocal delivery, with his distinctive low-husky voice gives a strong vibe of Japanese rock. For Drug Restaurant's debut album, Escape to Hangover, Jung explored garage rock and post-punk revival. During the making of his band's debut album, he listened to many garage rock bands to find inspiration.
