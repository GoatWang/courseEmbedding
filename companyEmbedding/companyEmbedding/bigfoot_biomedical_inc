Bigfoot Biomedical – Bigfoot is changing diabetes care by automating insulin delivery and designing simpler, safer, and more effective solutions for insulin-dependent diabetes.


























































 











 






 







  


 
  
 Bigfoot Biomedical is dedicated to designing simpler, safer, and more effective solutions for people with insulin-requiring diabetes.
  
  
 Our Story Begins...Are we ever going to sleep again?In 2011, the five-year-old son of a Wall Street quant trader was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). With no cure in sight, the diagnosis meant a lifetime of multiple daily insulin injections or clunky medical devices, analyzing every meal, countless blood tests, a constant fear of seizures, and an end to sleeping through the night.
But this father was unlike many. This dad hacked into an off-the-shelf insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor, wrote an algorithm to automatically dose insulin in the right amount at the right time, and married these pieces together in a companion mobile app - effectively creating an automated insulin delivery system.
Since 2013, his wife, also a person with T1D, and his son have been living as though diabetes barely exists. They eat, play, and work without the distress of dealing with diabetes. This mystery man, dubbed “Bigfoot” by the media, and his code, fine-tuned by more than 50,000 hours of real-world use, formed the foundation of Bigfoot Biomedical.

				Our Vision for Diabetes Management
				




At Bigfoot, we envision a world where life with diabetes is easier. We want to add sleep, reduce fear and worry, and increase the time that all people with insulin-requiring diabetes spend living a healthy life. To do that, we have to ask ourselves "How do you reduce the diabetes burden?"

				More Than Just a Device
				




We are drawing a circle around everything that it takes to manage insulin-requiring diabetes. We think about the complexity of diabetes therapies and how we can design simpler solutions that more people can actually access. We consider the way a healthcare provider prescribes a therapy and how we can eliminate hundreds of unnecessary steps. We think about how a therapy might deliver value to an insurance payer so that we can create a sustainable business.
From one end of the spectrum to the other, we are thinking of ways to reduce the pain points of managing diabetes. We are designing comprehensive solutions of device + software + service to help people with diabetes administer insulin more safely and access our service more cost-effectively.

 VISION
  
   
  
 How do you reduce the diabetes burden?You start with envisioning what life might look like without it.At Bigfoot, one of our core design principles is to reduce the burden of living with Type 1 and insulin-requiring Type 2 Diabetes. Closing an insulin delivery loop is part of the equation, but we believe that there is more to simplifying diabetes that involves thoughtful approaches like easy set-up, leveraging the power of smart technologies that we already use in other aspects of our lives, and a comprehensive yet simple supply management system.
  
  
 These are the questions we ask about diabetes management.
 
  
What would it take for you to sleep through the night without worrying so much about your blood sugar dropping too low?
  
  
What if you had a system that knew to give you a bit more insulin when your blood sugars were running high - without an extra shot or without you having to press a bunch of buttons?
  
  
How could we harness the power of machine learning for insulin dosing?
  
  
What if diabetes supplies showed up at your door before you opened the last bottle of test strips?
  
  
What if you didn't have three or four diabetes devices to update every time there was a time change?
  
  
What if your healthcare provider prescribed something because he or she felt supported and confident about the complete service, assistance, and training the company would provide?
  
  
What if your diabetes therapy was so effective that your insurance company said "yes, this is so much better" and you paid just one co-payment for everything?
  
  
What if all the things you hate about diabetes management were outsourced to a system that never gets tired, never checks out, never forgets, and knows how to keep you safe?
   
  
   
  
 Our Vision for Automated Insulin Delivery 
 Leverage existing smartphone technology 
 Simple, tight integration between components 
 Secure communication = connected ecosystem 
 Automate decisions about insulin delivery in real time 
 Leverage cloud-connectivity technologies 
 Accessed with single prescription and reimbursed as a service for a monthly fee  
  
 Our Vision for a Connected EcosystemAt Bigfoot, we are designing a smart, connected ecosystem powered by a core data analytics engine with you and your life at its heart. Our intention is for the connected devices and the virtuous cycle of data that they are intended to create to provide Bigfoot with the ability to help guide you and your healthcare team in your dosing and decision making.
 
  
 In short, Bigfoot wants to take the headache out of managing diabetes. If we know how much insulin you’re taking and what your glucose levels are, we have the potential to turn that data into actionable information that you, your healthcare provider, or your Bigfoot system could act on.

Diabetics can avoid finger pricks with new app from Abbott, Silicon Valley partner
July 13, 2017 - When Jeffrey Brewer's son was 15, the boy nearly lost his life because he took too much insulin. The diabetic teen took insulin to eat a large bag of chips late at night. But about 20 minutes later, he forgot about that first dose and took another. He spent two days in the hospital, his father said. "It was only by a miracle that my wife woke up at 4 a.m. and checked on him," said Brewer, president and CEO of Bigfoot Biomedical. "He would have been dead by 7 a.m." Now, Bigfoot Biomedical and north suburban-based Abbott Laboratories hope to help prevent such problems — and make life easier for millions of people with diabetes — with a new partnership announced Thursday.

“Not Good Enough”: How One Dad Led the Change in Diabetes Devices through Grassroots Research and Collaboration
April 6, 2017 - In 2002, Bigfoot Biomedical CEO Jeffrey Brewer’s technology career was flourishing, having founded two successful startup dot-coms that later became publicly traded companies. He had just moved his family from Silicon Valley to New York City, and was ready for new challenges. But when his young son received a devastating diagnosis just weeks after the family settled into their new home, Brewer found himself unable to focus on anything else. Stunned by the lack of information, high risk of error and antiquated devices available to help manage his son’s type 1 diabetes, Brewer began laying the groundwork for his most important technology project to date: automated insulin delivery (AID).

Bigfoot Biomedical starts clinical trial for artificial pancreas
July 21, 2016 - Startup Bigfoot Biomedical has started a clinical trial for its artificial pancreas device in Type 1 diabetes patients. The move comes after Medtronic ($MDT) recently submitted to the FDA for an approval of its own artificial pancreas product.
The devices giant, though, has a reputation for being technologically challenged when it comes to diabetes--so the startup may have room to best it on that front. If the technology becomes accurate enough, it could eliminate both finger-stick testing for blood glucose and insulin injections and replace that with a patch-based device.

Ones to Watch, ten companies we’re keeping an eye on
June 23, 2016 - It’s tough to pick just 10 medtech startups to profile out of the hundreds or thousands dotting the U.S. landscape, but we tried anyway.
It helped that we kept our criteria simple: A relatively new company, with only one or two (or no) financing rounds under their belts. Some are so deeply in stealth mode that they never responded to our enquiries.
More important in our selection process was that the technology being developed sparked our interest. That made it even tougher to winnow the field, as the array of unmet needs being met by ingenious medical devices is truly inspiring.

 What is Type 1 Diabetes?
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), once known as Juvenile Diabetes, is an autoimmune disease, meaning that the body’s own immune system, for reasons unknown, attacks cells in the body that it shouldn’t. In the case of T1D, the immune system destroys cells in the pancreas that produce a hormone called insulin that is necessary to convert the food you eat into energy. People with T1D must take insulin for the rest of their lives, either through a pump or daily injections, in order to prevent their blood glucose levels from rising too high.
Though often diagnosed in childhood, T1D can be diagnosed at any age. It is an intensely managed condition, requiring hundreds of decisions a day about how much insulin to take, how to respond to blood glucose levels, how to make choices about the food you eat and the activities in which you participate, just to name a few. The roots of Bigfoot’s founders stem from their personal experience with T1D, and it is their personal and professional mission, as well as many of the people working at Bigfoot, to bring to market our automated insulin delivery solutions to make living with T1D easier and safer.
What is Type 2 Diabetes?
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic condition in which the body is either unable to use the insulin made by the pancreas (known as insulin resistance) or in which the pancreas loses the ability to continue to produce insulin at the level that the body needs. A progressive disease, T2D often requires adjustments to therapy over time, which often includes the addition of insulin. According to recent statistics from the CDC, more than 30% of people with T2D in 2011 included insulin in their daily treatment regimen.
T2D may be diagnosed at any age and it is the most common type of diabetes, affecting roughly 95% of people with diabetes. Bigfoot's automated insulin delivery solutions are intended to help those with T2D who require insulin to optimize their insulin dosing regimen in the simplest, smartest way possible.
What is hypoglycemia?
Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, occurs when there is not enough glucose in the bloodstream to fuel the cells of the body. Hypoglycemia is considered any glucose level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). It can be caused by too much insulin (or other diabetes medication) or by activity, such as exercise. Symptoms may include shakiness, sweatiness, headache, blurry vision, hunger, palpitations, and confusion.
Severe hypoglycemia may result in loss of consciousness, seizures, brain damage, and in rare cases, death. Severe hypoglycemia, such as a seizure that requires a hospital admission, results in a huge cost to the person with diabetes as well as the healthcare system. Bigfoot’s automated insulin delivery solutions intend to significantly reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia, as well as the costs associated with it.
What is hyperglycemia?
Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, occurs when there is too much glucose in the bloodstream. A number of factors can cause hyperglycemia in people with diabetes, including but not limited to lack of insulin, food that has been eaten, stress, illness, and hormones. Symptoms may include thirst, frequent urination, hunger, or fatigue.
Severe hyperglycemia can result in a condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which may lead to coma, kidney failure, a problem with heart rhythm, heart attack, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and in rare cases, death. Similar to severe hypoglycemia, severe hyperglycemia or DKA has significant costs to the person with diabetes and the healthcare system. By leveraging data and automation, Bigfoot automated insulin delivery solutions intend to significantly reduce the instances of severe hypoglycemia and its related costs.
What is “time in range"?
“Time in range” refers to the percentage of time that a person’s blood glucose levels are in the recommended target range appropriate for that person. Different than HbA1c, which is a measurement that reflects an average glucose level over a period of time, time in range reflects the total amount of time that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are avoided. A primary goal of Bigfoot is to provide solutions for people with T1D or insulin-requiring T2D to spend more of their time in their target glucose ranges: increasing their “time in range.”
What is “automated insulin delivery"?
“Automated insulin delivery” is the term we use at Bigfoot to describe how a system uses information about glucose to change the delivery of insulin to assist in reducing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, increasing time spent in a healthy, safe, target glucose range. Referred to in the media as an “artificial pancreas,” an automated insulin delivery system is not an implanted device and not a biological cure for diabetes.

Are Bigfoot's solutions the same as the system that Bryan Mazlish created for his family?
The investigational system in development at Bigfoot Biomedical is not the system that Bryan Mazlish created for his family. The Mazlish system was a proof-of-concept system that has inspired the work we do today, especially the real world experiences that Bryan’s wife and son have had while living with and wearing their system for over 50,000 hours.
Has Bigfoot considered concerns about smartphone security and performance?
Security is a top priority of Bigfoot. Our team members have significant experience across consumer technology, enterprise software, and the regulated medical device space, so unlike a traditional medtech company, we are approaching questions of security - as well as concerns about the many ways in which we live and interact with consumer tech devices like smartphones - thoughtfully, working in tandem with FDA to ensure that concerns are addressed through our approach.
Do Bigfoot's solutions include glucagon?
We look forward to the day that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approves glucagon for use in an infusion pump and this option becomes available. Currently, there is no FDA-approved glucagon available for administration via an infusion pump, and there are many unanswered questions around the chronic administration of glucagon, as well as the use of glucagon in a closed loop system. In the meantime, we are maintaining a singular focus on developing a safe, simple, reliable, and accessible insulin-only system, that is available ASAP.
Can I order Bigfoot's products? When will they be available?
Bigfoot investigational system is still in development at this time. It's our goal to submit our investigational system for Premarket Approval (PMA) to the U.S. FDA in early 2018. Approval of our PMA application would allow us to sell our product on the market.
I live outside the U.S. Will Bigfoot's solutions be available in my country?
While our initial launch is planned for the U.S., we have plans to bring Bigfoot's solutions to countries outside the United States. A timeline for these countries has not yet been announced.
Will my health insurance cover Bigfoot's solutions?
One of the founding goals of Bigfoot Biomedical was to design comprehensive solutions that would be cost-effective for patients, healthcare providers, and insurance payers. Until we have FDA approval to market a product, it is too early to predict which payers will support Bigfoot's solutions. You can rest assured, however, that we are striving for broad coverage for all our solutions.
Can I participate in your clinical trials?
We have selected, and will continue to carefully select, some of the finest clinical trial investigators and research sites in the world. We leave participant recruitment and selection entirely in the hands of these outstanding investigators and research sites. If you would like to find out more about participating in a clinical trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov to find trials for which you or your family member might be eligible. You can also make sure that centers near you that do this kind of research have your contact information in the event that they're selected for our trials.
Do you offer tours of Bigfoot’s lair?
At this time, we do not offer tours of Bigfoot Biomedical’s headquarters. While the work we do is exciting and life-changing, watching us do it is considerably less so.
Where can I buy those cool Bigfoot t-shirts?
Due to high demand for the Bigfoot t-shirts you’ve spotted on our social media channels, we've made them available to the community. Check out the Bigfoot Shop to outfit yourself in one of our comfy performance t-shirts.

Abbott and Bigfoot Biomedical Announce Collaboration to Develop Breakthrough Diabetes Technologies

ABBOTT PARK, Ill. and MILPITAS, Calif., July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --�Abbott (NYSE: ABT) and Bigfoot Biomedical today announced that the companies have entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize diabetes management systems, integrating Abbott's FreeStyle� Libre glucose sensing technologyi with Bigfoot's insulin delivery solutions in the United States.
This collaboration brings people living with diabetes a significant step closer to the ultimate goal of eliminating much of the daily burden of diabetes management. As part of the agreement, Abbott will provide Bigfoot with the next generation of its FreeStyle Libre glucose sensing technology. Bigfoot will utilize this technology in the development of the first-ever personalized, user-friendly systems intended to optimize insulin delivery without the need for fingerstick calibration of a glucose sensor.
"Diabetes is increasing at record rates globally. There is a significant demand for tools that are intuitive and easy to use to help people take control of this complicated, challenging condition, but innovation in this area has been slow," said�Jared Watkin, senior vice president, Diabetes Care, Abbott. "Together with Bigfoot, we are challenging conventional methods of diabetes management by bringing together our expertise in superior glucose monitoring technology with a best-in-class insulin delivery system that is designed with the patient in mind. This will fundamentally transform the way diabetes is managed."
All people with Type 1 diabetes, and nearly one third of people with Type 2 diabetes, must inject insulin to manage their glucose � that's more than 6 million peopleii in the U.S. alone. Bigfoot and Abbott both share a vision to simplify the use of diabetes management systems for these insulin users: a goal that moves beyond technology and into accessibility and cost reduction for individuals, their health care providers and payers.� 
"Bigfoot is committed to solving the hard problems inherent in blending consumer technology, enterprise systems and Class III medical devices in an effort to design an easy-to-use system for people with diabetes," said Jeffrey Brewer, Bigfoot Biomedical president and chief executive officer. "Both Abbott and Bigfoot understand the real-world use of diabetes devices. A no-calibration glucose sensor is the final piece of the puzzle needed to enable consumer-friendly and accessible integrated insulin delivery systems."
Bigfoot has both injection and infusion pump-based insulin delivery systems in development. These investigational systems utilize intuitive design, Internet of Things connectivity, smartphone technology and machine learning automation to adjust insulin delivery or dosingwith the intent to keep glucose levels in an optimal range. Bigfoot anticipates initiating a pivotal trial incorporating FreeStyle Libre technology in 2018 at clinical research sites across the United States. 
Abbott's FreeStyle Libre system was introduced across�Europe�in 2014, and is now available in more than 35 countries and used by more than 300,000iii�people with diabetes around the world. Two published clinical trialsiv�and real-world evidence from more than 50,000 usersv�show that people who use the FreeStyle Libre system scan their glucose levels an average of at least 15 times per day. The studies show that people who scan more frequently spend less time in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) while having improved average glucose levels, demonstrating improved glucose control overall.
"Our companies have a shared commitment to developing products that are patient focused � simple, convenient, discreet, affordable and provide actionable information,"�said Brewer. "We could not be more excited to be collaborating with Abbott's outstanding team in bringing new innovations to people with diabetes."� ��
In the U.S., the FreeStyle Libre system is currently pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
About the AgreementUnder the terms of the agreement: 

Abbott will supply glucose measurement sensors for all of Bigfoot's insulin delivery systems in the U.S. as the exclusive sensors for those systems.

Bigfoot will develop and commercialize multiple systems using Abbott's FreeStyle Libre sensor technology, including systems designed to perform auto-titration for Bigfoot's connected insulin injection devices, as well as automated insulin delivery using Bigfoot's insulin infusion platform.

Financial terms are not being disclosed.
About Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc.:Bigfoot Biomedical was founded by a team of people with a personal connection to Type 1 diabetes and, with its insulin delivery services, seeks to change the paradigm of care for insulin-requiring diabetes by leveraging data, connectivity, automation, and machine learning to reduce the burden on people with diabetes and maximize the leverage of health care providers.

Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. Key Developments

Abbott and Bigfoot Biomedical Announce Collaboration to Develop Breakthrough Diabetes Technologies
Jul 13 17
Abbott and Bigfoot Biomedical announced that the companies have entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize diabetes management systems, integrating Abbott's FreeStyle®Libre glucose sensing technologyi with Bigfoot's insulin delivery solutions in the United States. This collaboration brings people living with diabetes a significant step closer to the ultimate goal of eliminating much of the daily burden of diabetes management. As part of the agreement, Abbott will provide Bigfoot with the next generation of its FreeStyle Libre glucose sensing technology. Bigfoot will utilize this technology in the development of the first-ever personalized, user-friendly systems intended to optimize insulin delivery without the need for fingerstick calibration of a glucose sensor. All people with Type 1 diabetes, and nearly one third of people with Type 2 diabetes, must inject insulin to manage their glucose that's more than 6 million peopleii in the U.S. alone. Bigfoot and Abbott both share a vision to simplify the use of diabetes management systems for these insulin users: a goal that moves beyond technology and into accessibility and cost reduction for individuals, their health care providers and payers. Bigfoot has both injection and infusion pump-based insulin delivery systems in development. These investigational systems utilize intuitive design, Internet of Things connectivity, smartphone technology and machine learning automation to adjust insulin delivery or dosing with the intent to keep glucose levels in an optimal range. Bigfoot anticipates initiating a pivotal trial incorporating FreeStyle Libre technology in 2018 at clinical research sites across the United States. Under the terms of the agreement: Abbott will supply glucose measurement sensors for all of Bigfoot's insulin delivery systems in the U.S. as the exclusive sensors for those systems. Bigfoot will develop and commercialize multiple systems using Abbott's FreeStyle Libre sensor technology, including systems designed to perform auto-titration for Bigfoot's connected insulin injection devices, as well as automated insulin delivery using Bigfoot's insulin infusion platform. Financial terms are not being disclosed.

Bigfoot Biomedical - Wikipedia





















 






Bigfoot Biomedical

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. is a medical technology startup headquartered in California.[1] The company was founded by parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D): Jeffrey Brewer, Bryan Mazlish, and Lane Desborough.[2]

1 History
2 System Components
3 Development Timeline
4 References



History[edit]
The company’s start may be traced back to 2011, when quantitative trader Bryan Mazlish’s son received his diagnosis of T1D. He developed a control algorithm to drive an automated and cloud-connected, closed-loop, artificial pancreas device for his wife and son, who have been using the closed-loop automation of insulin delivery since 2013.[3] The existence of this “homebrew artificial pancreas” was kept from the press and the subject of rumor, earning Mazlish the nickname Bigfoot from author Dan Hurley in a piece for Wired Magazine in 2014.[4]
In late 2014, Mazlish joined with Brewer and Desborough to form Bigfoot Biomedical in order to scale and commercialize the technology, calling the company Bigfoot Biomedical.[3][5]
In May 2015, Bigfoot acquired all the assets of Asante Solutions, former manufacturer of the Snap insulin pump. Later that month, Bigfoot announced its partnership with Dexcom in June 2015, securing the technology needed for the continuous glucose monitoring component of the system.[6]
System Components[edit]
The Bigfoot automated insulin delivery system will combine an insulin pump programmed with a proprietary control algorithm, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor and transmitter, and a commercial off-the-shelf smartphone. It will also integrate data generated from a Bluetooth connected blood glucose meter.[7]
Development Timeline[edit]
Bigfoot Biomedical’s first clinical trial[8] enrolled its first patients in 2016[9][10] with the hope of launching their automated insulin delivery system in 2018.[3]
