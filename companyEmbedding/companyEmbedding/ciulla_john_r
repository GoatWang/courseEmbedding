Webster promotes John R. Ciulla to President
 


 

 




 





 


WATERBURY, Conn., Oct. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Webster Financial Corporation (NYSE:   WBS), the holding company for Webster Bank, N.A., today announced that its board of directors promoted John R. Ciulla to president of the bank and the bank holding company and appointed him to the bank's board of directors. In addition, the board appointed Joseph J. Savage to executive vice chairman of the bank and the bank holding company. Both report to James C. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer.
In his new role, Ciulla, previously executive vice president and head of Commercial Banking, will add reporting responsibilities for Community Banking, Webster Private Bank, and Marketing.
"John's promotion to president recognizes his outstanding leadership and Commercial Banking's consistently strong performance," said Smith. "As head of the unit, he has continued Commercial Banking's growth trajectory, driving strong revenue growth, earning in excess of the unit's cost of capital, maintaining strong asset quality, expanding Webster's commercial banking footprint, and developing his strong management team."
Savage, formerly president, retains oversight of Human Resources and directly oversees the bank's programs for leadership development, incentive compensation, and employee engagement. He will continue to serve as a member of the bank's board. 
Smith said, "As president, Joe has contributed mightily to our progress toward our goal of becoming the highest performing mid-size bank in the country as measured by financial performance, customer satisfaction, and growth in key segments. He will continue to work closely with me in formulating strategy and will lead key external client initiatives." 
Ciulla joined Webster in 2004 as senior vice president for middle market banking and has served in a variety of management positions with increasing responsibility, including as chief credit risk officer from 2008 to 2010.

Webster Bank names John R. Cuilla its new president




Webster Bank named a new president late Wednesday, a likely successor to the longtime chief executive and son of the bank's founder.John R. Ciulla, 50, was named president of the Waterbury-based bank and its holding company, Webster Financial Corp., after more than a decade at the bank, most recently as executive vice president and head of commercial banking.As president, Ciulla will continue to lead the commercial bank and will add responsibilities for community banking, Webster's private bank and marketing.Webster's current president, Joseph J. Savage, has been appointed executive vice chairman and will continue to oversee human resources and programs for leadership development, incentive compensation and employee engagement. He will also continue to serve on the bank's board.Savage, 63, was named president in late 2013, after the abrupt resignation of Gerald Plush from the post. Plush had been viewed as the successor to the chief executive post.The chief executive post is now held by James C. Smith, son of the bank's founder, Harold W. Smith. Smith, 66, has not announced any plans for retirement.

"This is part of the bank's succession planning," Robert Guenther, a Webster spokesman, said Wednesday. "We are preparing the bank for the next generation of leaders for when they are in the driver's seat."Both Ciulla and Savage will report to Smith, who also serves as chairman.

If Ciulla ascends to chief executive, he would be the first to hold that role outside of the Smith family. Webster recently celebrated the 80th anniversary of its founding.Ciulla joined Webster in 2004 as senior vice president of middle market banking and later served in a variety of management positions, including chief credit risk officer from 2008 to 2010. As executive vice president and head of middle market banking from 2011 to 2013, he was responsible for several business units. He was promoted to lead commercial banking in 2014.

Previously, Ciulla worked at The Bank of New York and practiced law in New York."John's promotion to president recognizes his outstanding leadership and commercial banking's consistently strong performance," Smith said.As head of commercial banking, Ciulla drove strong revenue and earnings growth, and he continued to expand the reach of the unit's lending activities, Smith said.Smith praised Savage's contributions as president, including initiatives to make Webster the highest performing mid-size bank in the country, as measured by financial perfornance, customer satisfaction and other areas."He will contine to work closely with me in formulating strategy and will lead key external client initiatives," Smith said.

Sharpshooter Ciulla steps off Webster's bench as president

John R. Ciulla's promotion as Webster Bank's newest president — and its third in the last two years — rewards his leadership and performance successes, but doesn't guarantee he's next in line for the top seat at the Waterbury lender, its sitting CEO says.Webster CEO James C. Smith announced in September that Ciulla, 50, was the choice of Webster Financial's board of directors to succeed Joseph Savage, Ciulla's mentor, as president. Savage was elevated to vice chairman at the parent company.In a recent interview, Smith said Ciulla's ascension 11 years after joining Webster "recognizes his value to the organization and rewards him for his efforts.''However, all of Webster's senior officers, Ciulla included, Smith said, are the focus of rigorous succession planning and training, to identify everyone who is capable of ascending its ranks. In Ciulla's case, Smith said it is expected that "he will continue to lead well. That he will influence the strategies of the company within its business units, and that he will broaden his influence bankwide.'' Ciulla now reports directly to Smith.But one banking analyst whose company regularly tracks Webster's performance and has drawn fees from it for advisory services, says Ciulla has been a "rising star" at Webster for some time. This new post, the analyst said, could well position him to succeed Smith, although the CEO has shown no signs that he's ready to slow down."Jim Smith is very much in command as CEO and will be in that role for a while,'' said Mark Fitzgibbon, research director for finance-industry investment advisor Sandler O'Neill + Partners. "That will give [John] a chance to work side by side, to hone the skills that he might need to develop."Ciulla got his first exposure to banking as a loan officer for former Connecticut National Bank in downtown Hartford, from 1987 to 1989. It was so fulfilling that, after time away to practice law, he returned to banking."It's a good, challenging career,'' the North Haven native said recently in Webster's downtown CityPlace II office, blocks from where he got his banking start. "It's got a sales-management aspect to it. There's a risk-management side. And it's good for society.''Within a few years, after working at People's United Bank's predecessor for several more, Ciulla pursued his Fordham University law degree in New York City.But banking was never far from his mind. So after working at a pair of New York City law firms with clients on financial and other business matters, Ciulla returned to banking full-time in 1997, with Bank of New York. Seven years later, he joined Webster's commercial-loan unit.Smith, the $24 billion-asset Waterbury bank's second-generation leader, says Ciulla proved an asset right away. Ciulla works out of Webster's Waterbury headquarters and Stamford regional office, near his Westchester County, N.Y., home."He brought an extraordinary intellect,'' Smith said of Ciulla. "A great background in finance. He's a lawyer. He's got an MBA. He brought a perspective on commercial banking that we may not have had before.''Webster connectionsCiulla said it was Savage, Jerry Plush's successor as Webster's president in 2014, who recruited him back to Connecticut, to work there. Savage had devoted much of his banking career doing "specialized lending,'' expertise Ciulla says he's tried to leverage more of within Webster."John has all the intellect and [energy quotient] you'd expect but most importantly he checks his ego at the door and, most impressively, he does the right thing always,'' Savage said via email. "He is the real deal. As bankers we must first judge a borrower's character and capacity. John has the smarts and perceptual abilities to do both."  For instance, Ciulla launched several industry specialty groups, such as a media/telecommunications unit, which Webster commercial bankers mine for customer transaction and loan business."It's been a differentiator for us,'' Ciulla said. "We were a thrift initially. In the last 10 to 12 years, we've evolved the bank into a full-service regional commercial bank. We think more like a large commercial bank than we have previously.''Webster has the footprint to prove it. Starting with its expansion into the Boston commercial market in 2009, first with a commercial loan office, Webster later moved into Westchester County, N.Y., before establishing its New York City beachhead.But it was in 2008, with the first signs of a mounting crisis in the securitized home-mortgage sector, as well as cracks in the U.S. economy, that Ciulla was named Webster's chief credit-risk officer. That put him in charge of, among other things, ensuring Webster didn't place too many bad-credit bets.On his watch, Webster undertook an extensive review of its credit policies, revising and updating as necessary, Ciulla said. The bank also implemented a new credit-management information system, to more timely and efficiently monitor its credit risks. Finally, Webster took a closer look at all of its lines of business and exited some, like aircraft financing, he said.Like some other U.S. lenders blindsided by the near-global financial meltdown that formally signaled the onset of the Great Recession, Webster was forced to raise new capital. That included $115 million in fresh equity sold to Wall Street to go with $400 million borrowed from the U.S. Treasury under its Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.Webster has since repaid its TARP borrowing; investor Warburg Pincus reaped dividends, cashing in on stock warrants whose value climbed as the bank and the economy recovered.Both the financial upheaval and recession still echo with Ciulla."It changed the regulatory landscape and made it more difficult to operate,'' he said. "If anything, it validated how Webster, in good times and bad, stayed with its customers. We helped stabilize the economies in the markets where we operated, and certainly our customers, by providing them with liquidity and products.''After helping stabilize Webster's balance sheet and recasting its lending model as credit-risk chief, Ciulla moved back to the lending side, where he had a hand in again expanding its footprint, this time into Manhattan, Philadelphia and Washington D.C."John has a good balance between having the technical knowledge of the business and having a very good personality,'' said Fitzgibbon, the Sandler O'Neill analyst.Away from Webster, Ciulla is involved in a host of community and family activities in Larchmont, N.Y. The North Haven native coaches his seventh-grade son's travel basketball team — a sport Ciulla knows well. Married, Ciulla also has a daughter in ninth grade.At 6 feet 4 inches, he was a three-year starting shooting guard at Williams College, and was inducted in 2013 into North Haven High's Sports Hall of Fame for his athletic prowess.The team aspects of sports, too, have propelled his growth as a banker, Ciulla said."In any sports activity,'' he said, "there is the idea of teamwork. Learning how to deal with adversity. Dedication. Hard work. Winning gracefully. Losing gracefully. All these teach you how to comport yourself.''

Revised in the aftermath of the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, the third edition of Honest Work: A Business Ethics Reader reflects and reinforces the editors' assertion that business ethics is primarily about the ethics of individuals. Featuring 115 brief articles and 89 real-life case studies, this unique anthology covers all aspects of business ethics under the overarching theme of the good life--what it means to students as individuals, what it means for business, and what it means for society. The book also includes an extensive chapter that explores the relationship between leadership and ethical behavior in business. Excerpts from plays, short stories, and novels enliven the text, and study and discussion questions engage students.
In the wake of the global recession, the third edition offers 18 new readings and 21 new case studies on such topics as employment in an uncertain job market, honesty and trust, the financial crisis, justice and fairness, the free market, the global village, and more. This edition also includes more discussion questions for each article and chapter.An Instructor's Resource CD containing chapter objectives and summaries, essay questions, a test bank, suggested readings, and web links is available to adopters. A Companion Website at www.oup.com/us/ciulla contains the same material as the Instructor's CD along with self-quizzes, suggested readings, and web links for students.

 "Excellent. All of the major business ethics topics are treated. The case studies are very useful and the questions after each reading are very appropriate."--David E. Dieteman, Penn State Erie, The Behrend College
