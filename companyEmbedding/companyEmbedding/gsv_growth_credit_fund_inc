Notes to
Unaudited Financial Statements as of September 30,
2016

 




 



(1)



Organization
and Basis of Presentation




 

Organization

GSV Growth
Credit Fund Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland
corporation that was formed on August 31, 2015. The Company was
formed primarily to lend to, and selectively invest in,
middle-market companies in the United States.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, no operations other than the sale and issuance
of 1,667 shares of common stock on October 8, 2015, at an aggregate
purchase price of $25,000 ($14.9970 per share) to R. David Spreng,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, have occurred. The
sale of shares of common stock was approved by the unanimous
consent of the Company’s sole director at the
time.

 

The
Company intends to be managed by GSV Growth Credit LLC (the
“Adviser”). No management fees will be paid to the
Adviser until the 91st day after the commencement of investment
activities.

 

Development
Stage Company

The
Company is a development stage company as defined by ASC 915-10-05,
“Development Stage Entity”. The Company is still
devoting substantially all of its efforts to establishing the
business, and its planned principal operations have not commenced.
The Company had no operations or investment activities during the
one-month period ended September 30, 2015.

 

Basis of
Presentation

The
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

Fiscal
Year End

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31.

 

(2) 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. Such estimates could differ from those estimates and
such differences could be material.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid
investments ( e.g. , money market funds, U.S. treasury
notes) with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and
cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value.
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions.

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company intends to file an election to be treated as a business
development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. The Company also intends to elect to be treated as a
regulated investment company (“RIC”) under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for
the taxable year ending December 31, 2015 and subsequent
taxable years. So long as the Company maintains its status as a
RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income
taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes
at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax
liability related to income earned by the Company represents
obligations of the Company’s investors and will not be
reflected in the financial statements of the Company.

 

Management
does not believe any recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statement.

Commitments
and Contingencies




 

In March
2016, the Company and the Adviser agreed that initial organization
and operating costs will be borne by the Company up to a maximum
amount of the greater of either $500,000 or 0.50% of total capital
commitments received by the Company as of the end of the most
recently completed calendar quarter, and will be paid or reimbursed
upon receipt of a formal commitment of external capital. Any
initial organization and operating costs in excess of the greater
of $500,000 or 0.50% of total capital commitments received by the
Company, as applicable, will be borne by the Adviser. In the event
receipt of a formal commitment of external capital does not occur,
initial organization and operating costs incurred will be borne by
the Adviser. As there has been no formal commitment of external
capital as of the date of issuance of these financial statements,
no such costs have been recorded by the Company.

Net
Assets




 

In
connection with its formation, the Company has the authority to
issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 per share par
value.

 




 



(5)



Subsequent
Events




     

There have
been no subsequent events that require recognition or disclosure
through November 1, 2016, the date that the financial statements
were available to be issued.

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These
forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are
based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us,
our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry,
our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as
“anticipates,” “expects,”
“intends,” “plans,” “will,”
“may,” “continue,” “believes,”
“seeks,” “estimates,” “would,”
“could,” “should,” “targets,”
“projects,” “outlook,”
“potential,” “predicts” and variations of
these words and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult
to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements,
including without limitation:

 




 



·



an
economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies’
ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of
some or all of our investments in such portfolio
companies;




 




 



·



such an
economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies
that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to
experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished
demand for capital from these companies;




 




 



·



a
contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the
equity markets could impair our lending and investment
activities;




 




 



·



interest
rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly if
we elect to use leverage as part of our investment
strategy;




 




 



·



currency
fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments
in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive
payments denominated in foreign currency rather than
U.S. dollars;




 




 



·



our future
operating results;




 




 



·



our
business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio
companies;




 




 



·



our
contractual arrangements and relationships with third
parties;




 




 



·



the
ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their
objectives;




 




 



·



competition
with other entities and our affiliates for investment
opportunities;




 




 



·



the
speculative and illiquid nature of our investments;




 




 



·



the use of
borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments;




 




 



·



the
adequacy of our financing sources and working capital;




 




 



·



the loss
of key personnel;




 




 



·



the timing
of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio
companies;




 




 



·



the
ability of our external investment adviser, GSV Growth Credit LLC
(“GSVGC”), to locate suitable investments for us and to
monitor and administer our investments;




 




 



·



the
ability of GSVGC to attract and retain highly talented
professionals;




 




 



·



our
ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a regulated
investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
and as a business development company
(“BDC”);




 




 



·



the effect
of legal, tax and regulatory changes; and




 

 




 



7



 




  

 




 



·



the other
risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify under
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” of Amendment No. 2 to our
Registration Statement on Form 10, filed on April 19, 2016 (File
No. 000-55544), and Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.




 

Although
we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking
statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could
prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking
statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In
light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a
projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not
be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives
will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those
described or identified in the section entitled “Item 1A.
Risk Factors” of Amendment No. 2 to our Registration
Statement on Form 10, filed on April 19, 2016 (File No. 000-55544),
and Item 1A of Part II and elsewhere in this report. These
forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this
report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update
the forward-looking statements. The safe harbor provisions of
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), which preclude civil liability for
certain forward-looking statements will not be applicable to us
when we elect to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), since, at
such time, we will be an investment company.

The
following analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 

Overview

 

We were
formed on August 31, 2015 as a corporation under the laws of the
State of Maryland. We are currently in the development stage and
have not commenced investment operations. Since inception, there
has been no activity. In October 2015, in connection with our
formation, we issued and sold 1,667 shares of our common stock to
David Spreng, our President and Chief Executive Officer, for an
aggregate purchase price of $25,000.

 

Prior to
the initial closing of our private offering, which will occur as
soon as practicable in the sole discretion of our investment
adviser, GSVGC, upon the receipt of aggregate commitments totaling
at least $50 million , we intend to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) an election to be
treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also intend to elect to be
treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under
Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
While we intend to elect to be treated as a RIC as soon as
practicable, we anticipate that we may have difficulty satisfying
the asset diversification requirements as we deploy initial capital
and build our portfolio. To the extent that we have net taxable
income prior to our qualification as RIC, we will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on such income. As a BDC and a RIC, we will
be required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as
the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in
“qualifying assets,” source of income limitations,
asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to
distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income and
tax-exempt interest.

 

We will be
externally managed by GSVGC, an investment adviser that intends to
register under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. GSV
Credit Service Company, LLC, our administrator (the
“Administrator”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSVGC
and will provide the administrative services necessary for us to
operate.

 

We are an
“emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We
will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years
following an initial public offering, if any, although if the
market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we
would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following
December 31. For so long as we remain an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public
company reporting requirements.

 

Portfolio
and Investment Activity

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have not
commenced investment activities.

 

Results of
Operations

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have not
completed the initial closing of our private offering or commenced
any operational or investment activities. Therefore, no results of
operations are reported.

 

Revenue

 

Our
investment objective is to maximize our total return to our
stockholders primarily through current income on our loan
portfolio, and secondarily through capital appreciation on our
warrants and other equity positions. We intend to achieve our
investment objective by investing in high growth-potential, private
companies. We will typically invest in senior secured and second
lien secured loans that generally fall into two strategies:
Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending. Through
our Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending
strategies, we will invest in senior secured loans and second lien
loans. Our Sponsored Growth Lending will also typically include the
receipt of warrants and/or other equity from venture-backed
companies. We expect our investments in loans will generally range
from between $3 million to $15 million and the upper end of this
range may increase as we raise additional capital.

 

 




 



9



 




  

 

We plan to
generate revenue in the form of interest on the debt securities
that we hold and distributions and capital gains on other interests
that we acquire in our portfolio companies. We expect that the debt
we invest in will generally have stated terms of 36 to 60 months.
Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or
semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide
for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind
(“PIK”) interest. The principal amount of the debt
securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will
become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate
revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with
transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or
premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such
amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on
loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if
any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we
expect to collect such amounts.

 

Operating
Expenses

 

Our
primary operating expenses will include the payment of fees to
GSVGC under the advisory agreement we intend to enter into with
GSVGC prior to the filing of our election to be treated as a BDC
(the “Advisory Agreement”), our allocable portion of
overhead expenses under the administration agreement we intend to
enter into with the Administrator prior to the filing of our
election to be treated as a BDC (the “Administration
Agreement”) and other operating costs described below. We
will bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our
operations and transactions, including those relating
to:

 




 



·



organization
and offering (in an amount up to the greater of either $500,000 or
0.5% of the aggregate amount of capital committed to us by
investors as of the end of the most recently completed calendar
quarter, provided that, the amount of initial organizational and
offering expenses in excess of the greater of $500,000 or 0.5% of
the aggregate amount of capital committed to us by investors as of
the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, as
applicable, will be paid by GSVGC);




 




 



·



our
pro-rata portion of fees and expenses related to any future
spin-off transactions;

As there
were no formal commitments of external capital as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, we have recorded no such costs.
Until such time as we receive a formal commitment of external
capital or, in the event we do not receive a formal commitment of
external capital, GSVGC will pay all organization and offering
expenses.

 

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

 

We expect
to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of the
offering of our securities, (ii) cash flows from our operations,
(iii) any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future
and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. We
may fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks
and issuances of senior securities.

 

Our
primary use of funds from a credit facility will be investments in
portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of our common
stock and the payment of operating expenses.

 

In the
future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments. If we
undertake a securitization transaction, we will consolidate our
allocable portion of the debt of any securitization subsidiary on
our financial statements, and include such debt in our calculation
of the asset coverage test, if and to the extent required pursuant
to the guidance of the staff of the SEC. An investment in a
securitization vehicle, even one sponsored by us, would be
considered a “non-qualifying asset” for purposes of
Section 55 of the 1940 Act.

 

Our
primary use of funds will be to make investments in eligible
portfolio companies, pay our operating expenses and make
distributions to holders of our common stock.

 

Equity
Activity

 

In
connection with our formation, we have the authority to issue
100,000,000 shares of common stock at a $0.01 per share par
value.

 

On October
8, 2015, we issued 1,667 shares of our common stock to David
Spreng, our President and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate
purchase price of $25,000. We have not had any other equity
transactions as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015.

 

Contractual
Obligations

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have not
commenced operations.

 

We intend
to enter into the Advisory Agreement with GSVGC prior to the filing
of our election to be treated as a BDC. Pursuant to the Advisory
Agreement, we will pay GSVGC a fee for investment advisory and
management services consisting of two components — (i) a base
management fee equal to a percentage of the aggregate amount of
capital committed
