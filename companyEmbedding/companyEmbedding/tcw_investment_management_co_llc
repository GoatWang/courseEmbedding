2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

History[edit]
Founded by Robert Addison Day in 1971 and headquartered in Los Angeles, TCW manages a broad range of investment products.[1] The TCW Group was originally known as Trust Company of the West. TCW clients include many of the largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations in the U.S., as well as foreign investors and high-net-worth individuals.[2]
In 2001, Société Générale (SocGen) acquired a controlling interest in The TCW Group.[3][4]
On February 24, 2010, TCW announced the completion of its acquisition of Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC (MetWest), a leading fixed income investment management firm.[5]
In February 2013, TCW management and alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group acquired TCW Group from Société Générale.[6] As a result of the transaction, TCW management and employees increased their ownership in the firm to approximately 40% on a fully diluted basis, better aligning interests with clients. Equity for the investment came from two Carlyle investment funds and from TCW management.[7]
As of March 31, 2017, TCW had $194.3 billion of assets under management or committed to management.[8] The CEO of The TCW Group is David Lippman.[9]
Operations[edit]
The company is based in Los Angeles with offices in New York, Boston, Chicago, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

                TCW: Investment Manager Highlight            


    By J.B. Maverick | March 11, 2016 — 7:12 AM EST

TCW is a leading global asset management firm with more than four decades of investment experience and a broad range of products across fixed income, equities, emerging markets and alternative investments. Through the TCW, MetWest and TCW Alternative Fund Families, TCW manages one of the largest mutual fund complexes in the U.S. TCW’s clients include many of the world’s largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations, as well as financial advisors and high net worth individuals. TCW is headquartered in Los Angeles, and has offices in New York, Boston, Chicago, London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.
Founded in 1971 and based in Los Angeles, TCW manages a broad range of innovative, value-added investment products that strive to enhance and protect clients' wealth. TCW clients include many of the largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations in the U.S., as well as a substantial number of foreign investors and high net worth individuals. TCW works in close partnership with Financial Advisors to help build their businesses and meet the needs of their clients.
The firm has approximately $197.3 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of September 30, 2016.
Investing at TCW Group
TCW invests globally in both publicly traded companies and fixed-income securities, including government and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and floating-rate debt securities. The firm also makes alternative asset investments in the energy and infrastructure markets, as well as in special situation opportunities.
TCW’s analysts and portfolio managers utilize intensive fundamental analysis in selecting equities, primarily relying on a bottom-up stock-picking strategy. The company benchmarks its fixed-income investments in comparison to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch USD LIBOR 3-Month Average Index.
Management and Investment Professionals at TCW
The management executives at TCW have an average 21 years of financial services industry experience, and the average tenure at TCW for the company’s portfolio managers is approximately 11 years.
The president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the TCW Group is David Lippman. He holds a J.D. degree from Hofstra University, and joined TCW during the company’s acquisition of Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC. Prior to coming to TCW, he was the CEO of Metropolitan West, and served as head of sales and marketing at TCW before assuming his current position at the firm. Lippman’s previous experience in the financial services arena includes working for Credit Suisse and Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Marc Stern, currently chairman at TCW, originally joined the firm in 1990 and has previously served as president, vice chairman and CEO of the company. He has a J.D. degree earned at Columbia University. Before coming to TCW, Stern was the president at SunAmerica Inc., and he previously worked at the legal firm Debevoise & Plimpton. Stern also serves several public functions, being a board member of the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County and of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Tad Rivelle is a key leader of the investment team at TCW as chief investment officer for fixed income investments. Rivelle has an MBA degree, earned at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Before joining TCW, he was the chief investment officer at Metropolitan West, the company that he co-founded. Rivelle was also previously employed as the co-director of fixed-income investments for Hotchkis & Wiley, and as a portfolio manager for Pacific Investment Management Company LLC. In addition to his MBA, Rivelle holds degrees in both physics and applied mathematics.
Patrick Doyle, who holds a degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley, is another member of the TCW leadership team who came aboard as part of the acquisition of Metropolitan Asset Management. He is currently the managing director of the real estate special situations group at TCW. Doyle’s previous experience includes working as a managing partner of The Winter Group Inc., where he also served as president of the company’s asset management operations, and working at a Winter Group subsidiary, Specialized Loan Servicing LLC, where he was on the board of directors. Doyle has also been a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston, and worked as a securities trader at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC).
Penelope Foley, who earned her BA degree from Hollins College, is the group managing director for emerging market investments at TCW and a portfolio manager for emerging market strategies. Before joining TCW in 1990, Foley was employed as a senior vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert, where she worked in managing the company’s Americas Development Association L.P. Prior to that, she was a vice president at Citicorp and an associate in the corporate finance department of Lehman Brothers.
